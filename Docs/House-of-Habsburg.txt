The '''House of Habsburg''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|p|s|.|b|ɜr|ɡ}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhaːps.bʊʁk}}), or '''House of Austria''',<ref>[http://www.habsburger.net/en/chapter/house-austria-habsburgs-and-empire?language=de "The House of Austria – the Habsburgs and the Empire"]</ref> was one of the most influential [[dynasty|royal house]]s of Europe. The throne of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was continuously occupied by the Habsburgs between 1438 and 1740. The house also produced emperors and kings of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of England]] (''[[Jure uxoris]]'' King), [[Kingdom of France]] ([[Queen consort]]), [[Kingdom of Germany]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]], [[Empire of Russia]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], [[Second Mexican Empire]], [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (''[[Jure uxoris]]'' King), [[Kingdom of Portugal]], and [[Habsburg Spain]], as well as rulers of [[Habsburg Netherlands|several Dutch]] and Italian principalities. From the sixteenth century, following the reign of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the dynasty was split between Austrian and Spanish branches. Although they ruled distinct territories, they nevertheless maintained close relations and frequently intermarried.

The House takes its name from [[Habsburg Castle]], a fortress built in the 1020s in present-day [[Switzerland]] by [[Radbot, Count of Habsburg|Count Radbot]] of [[Klettgau]], who chose to name his fortress Habsburg. His grandson [[Otto II, Count of Habsburg|Otto II]] was the first to take the fortress name as his own, adding "Count of Habsburg" to his title. The House of Habsburg gathered dynastic momentum through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries.

By 1276, Count Radbot's seventh generation descendant [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] had moved the family's power base from Habsburg Castle to the [[Duchy of Austria]]. Rudolph had become [[List of German monarchs|King of Germany]] in 1273, and the dynasty of the House of Habsburg was truly entrenched in 1276 when Rudolph became ruler of Austria, which the Habsburgs ruled until 1918.

A series of dynastic marriages<ref>Paula Sutter Fichtner, "Dynastic Marriage in Sixteenth-Century Habsburg Diplomacy and Statecraft: An Interdisciplinary Approach," ''American Historical Review'' Vol. 81, No. 2 (April 1976), pp. 243-265 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1851170 in JSTOR]</ref> enabled the family to vastly expand its domains to include [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]], [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and its colonial empire, Bohemia, Hungary, and other territories. In the 16th century, the family separated into the senior Habsburg Spain and the junior [[Habsburg Monarchy]] branches, who settled their mutual claims in the [[Oñate treaty]].

The House of Habsburg became extinct in the 18th century. The senior Spanish branch ended upon the death of [[Charles II of Spain]] in 1700 and was replaced by the [[House of Bourbon]]. The remaining Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI]], and completely in 1780 with the death of his eldest daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria]]. It was succeeded by the Vaudemont branch of the [[House of Lorraine]]. The new successor house styled itself formally as [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Habsburg-Lothringen''), although it was often referred to as simply the House of Habsburg.

==History==

===Counts of Habsburg===
[[Image:Schweiz Frühmia Adel.svg|thumb|400px|The Habsburg dominions around 1200 in the area of modern-day Switzerland are shown as {{legend0|#f4bedb|Habsburg}}, among the houses of  {{legend0|#f7b282|[[House of Savoy|Savoy]]}}, {{legend0|#9dd575|[[Zähringer]]}} and {{legend0|#f6f07f|[[Counts of Kyburg|Kyburg]]}}]]

The progenitor of the House of Habsburg may have been [[Guntram the Rich]], a count in the [[Breisgau]] who lived in the 10th century. His grandson [[Radbot, Count of Habsburg]] founded the [[Habsburg Castle]], after which the Habsburgs are named. The origins of the castle's name, located in what is now the Swiss [[canton of Aargau]], are uncertain. There is disagreement on whether the name is derived from the [[High German]] ''Habichtsburg'' (Hawk Castle), or from the Middle High German word "hab/hap" meaning ford, as there is a river with a ford nearby. The first documented use of the name by the dynasty itself has been traced to the year 1108.<ref>"Habsburger-Gedenkjahr im Aargau", ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'', (page 17) 23 May 2008.</ref><ref>[http://www.art-tv.ch/1965-0-habsburger-gedenkjahr.html art-tv.ch]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.ch/staatsarchiv/de/pub/fokus/habsburger_gedenkjahr.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223234043/http://www.ag.ch/staatsarchiv/de/pub/fokus/habsburger_gedenkjahr.php |title=Kanton Aargau |archivedate=December 23, 2008|language=de}}</ref>
The Habsburg Castle was the [[family seat]] in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.

The Habsburgs expanded their influence through arranged marriages and by gaining political privileges, especially countship rights in [[Zürichgau]], [[Aargau]] and [[Thurgau]]. In the 13th century, the house aimed its marriage policy at families in [[Upper Alsace]] and [[Swabia]]. They were also able to gain high positions in the church hierarchy for their members. Territorially, they often profited from the extinction of other noble families such as the [[House of Kyburg]].<ref name=heimann/>

===Kings of the Romans===
By the second half of the 13th century, count [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph IV]] (1218–1291) had become one of the most influential territorial lords in the area between the [[Vosges Mountains]] and [[Lake Constance]]. Due to these impressive preconditions, on 1 October 1273 Rudolph was chosen as the [[King of the Romans]] and received the name [[Rudolph I of Germany]].<ref name=heimann>''Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. ISBN 3-406-44754-6.</ref>

In 1282, the Habsburgs gained the rulership of the [[Duchy of Austria]], which they then held for over 600 years, until 1918. Through the forged [[Privilegium Maius]] document (1358/59), a special bond was created between the House and Austria. The document, forged at the behest of [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]] (1339–1365), also attempted to introduce rules to preserve the unity of the family's Austrian lands. In the long term, this indeed succeeded, but Rudolph's descendants ignored the rule, leading to the separation of the [[Albertinian Line|Albertian]] and [[Leopoldian line|Leopoldian]] family lines in 1379.<ref name=heimann/>

By marrying [[Elisabeth of Luxembourg]], the daughter of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] in 1437, Duke [[Albert II of Germany|Albert V]] (1397–1439) became the ruler of [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]], expanding the family's political horizons. The next year, Albert V was crowned as the [[King of the Romans]] as [[Albert II of Germany|Albert II]]. After his early death in war with the Turks in 1439, and after the death of his son [[Ladislaus Postumus]] in 1457, the Habsburgs lost Bohemia and Hungary again. National kingdoms were established in these areas, and the Habsburgs were not able to restore their influence there for decades.

===Holy Roman Emperors===
[[File:Growth of Habsburg territories.jpg|thumb|350px|Growth of the Habsburg Empire in Central Europe.]]

In 1440, [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] was chosen by the [[Prince-elector|Electoral College]] to succeed Albert II as the king. Several Habsburg kings had attempted to gain the imperial throne over the years, but success finally arrived on 19 March 1452 when [[Pope Nicholas V]] crowned Frederick III as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in a grand ceremony held in [[Rome]]. In Frederick III, the Pope found an important political ally with whose help he was able to counter the [[conciliarism|conciliar movement]].<ref name=heimann/>

While in Rome, Frederick III married [[Eleanor of Portugal, Holy Roman Empress|Eleanor of Portugal]], enabling him to build a network of connections with dynasties in the west and southeast of Europe. Frederick was rather distant to his family; Eleanor, by contrast, had a great influence on the raising and education of Frederick's children, and therefore played an important role in the family's rise to prominence. After Frederick III's coronation, the Habsburgs were able to hold the imperial throne almost continuously for centuries, until 1806.<ref name=heimann/>

As Emperor, Frederick III took a leading role inside the family and positioned himself as the judge over the family's internal conflicts, often making use of the [[privilegium maius]]. He was able to restore the unity of the house's Austrian lands, as the [[Albertinian line]] was now extinct. Territorial integrity was also strengthened by the extinction of the [[Tyrolean line|Tyrolean branch]] of the Leopoldian line in 1490/1496. Frederick's aim was to make Austria a united country, stretching from the [[Rhine]] to the [[Mur (river)|Mur]] and [[Leitha]].<ref name=heimann/>

On the external front, one of Frederick's main achievements was the [[Siege of Neuss]] (1474–75), in which he forced [[Charles the Bold of Burgundy]] to give his daughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] as wife to Frederick's son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]].<ref name=heimann/> The wedding took place on the evening of 16 August 1477 and ultimately resulted in the Habsburgs acquiring control of the [[Low Countries]]. After Mary's early death in 1482, Maximilian attempted to secure the Burgundian heritance to one of his and Mary's children [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]]. [[Charles VIII of France]] contested this, using both military and dynastic means, but the Burgundian succession was finally ruled in favour of Philip in the [[Treaty of Senlis]] in 1493.<ref name=erbe>Erbe, Michael: Die Habsburger 1493-1918. Eine Dynastie im Reich und in Europa. W. Kohlhammer, 2000. ISBN 3-17-011866-8</ref>

After the death of his father in 1493, Maximilian was proclaimed the new [[King of the Romans]], receiving the name [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. Maximilian was initially unable to travel to Rome to receive the Imperial title from the Pope, due to opposition from Venice and from the French who were occupying Milan, as well a refusal from the Pope due to enemy forces being present on his territory. In 1508, Maximilian proclaimed himself as the "chosen Emperor," and this was also recognized by the Pope due to changes in political alliances. This had a historical consequence in that, in the future, the Roman King would also automatically become Emperor, without needing the Pope's consent. In 1530, Emperor Charles V became the last person to be crowned as the Emperor by the Pope.<ref name="erbe"/>

Maximilian's rule (1493–1519) was a time of great expansion for the Habsburgs. In 1497, Maximilian's son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] (also known as Phillip the Fair) married [[Joanna of Castile]], also known as Joan the Mad, heiress of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], [[Aragon]], and most of Spain. Phillip and Joan had six children, the eldest of whom became [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and inherited the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon (including their colonies in the [[New World]]), Southern Italy, [[Austria]], and the [[Low Countries]].<ref>Great Events from History, ''The Renaissance & Early Modern Era'', Vol I, p. 112–114, author-Clare Callaghan, ISBN 1-58765-214-5.</ref>

The foundations for the later empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] were laid in 1515 by the means of a double wedding between Louis, only son of [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II, King of Hungary]], and Maximilian's granddaughter Mary; and between her brother Archduke Ferdinand and Vladislaus' daughter Anna. The wedding was celebrated in grand style on 22 July 1515, and has been described by some historians as the [[First Congress of Vienna]] due to its significant implications for Europe's political landscape. All the children were still minors, so the wedding was formally completed in 1521. Vladislaus died on 13 March 1516, and Maximilian died on 12 January 1519, but his designs were ultimately successful: on Louis's death in 1526, Maximilian's grandson [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] became the King of Bohemia.

The Habsburg dynasty achieved the position of a true [[world power]] by the time of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], for the first and only time in their history—the "World Emperor" and his [[The empire on which the sun never sets|"empire on which the sun never sets"]].

===Division of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs===
[[File:Habsburg dominions 1700.png|thumb|right|300px|The Spanish and Austrian Habsburg Dominions in 1700, not showing their overseas empire, but showing the division between the Spanish and Austrian branch with their losses and gains.]]

After the assignment, on 21 April 1521, of the Austrian lands to [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] by his brother Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (also King Charles I of Spain) (1516–1556), the dynasty split into the junior branch of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] Habsburgs and the senior branch of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburgs]]. The Austrian Habsburgs held the title of [[Holy Roman Emperor]] after Charles' death in 1558, as well as the Habsburg Hereditary Lands and the Kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary.

The senior Spanish branch ruled over Spain, its Italian possessions and its colonial empire, the Netherlands, and, for a time (1580–1640), Portugal. [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] was partly under Habsburg rule from 1526. For 150 years most of the country was occupied by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] but these territories were re-conquered in 1683–1699.

In the secret [[Oñate treaty]], the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs settled their mutual claims. The Spanish Habsburgs died out in 1700 (prompting the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]), as did the last male of the Austrian Habsburg line in 1740 (prompting the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]), and finally the last female of the Habsburg male line in 1780.

===Extinction of the Spanish Habsburgs===
The Habsburgs sought to consolidate their power by the frequent use of [[consanguineous marriage]]s. They were said to have a proverb that 'The best spouse for a Habsburg is another Habsburg.'{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} This resulted in a cumulatively deleterious effect on their [[gene pool]]. [[Cousin marriage|Marriages between first cousin]]s, or between uncle and niece, were commonplace in the family. A study of 3,000 family members over 16 generations by the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] suggests that inbreeding directly led to their extinction.  The gene pool eventually became so small that the last of the Spanish line [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], who was severely disabled from birth, perhaps by [[genetic disorders]], possessed a [[genome]] comparable to that of a child born to a brother and sister, as did his father, probably because of "remote [[inbreeding]]".<ref name=inbred>{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0005174 |title=The Role of Inbreeding in the Extinction of a European Royal Dynasty|last=Gonzalo Alvarez, Francisco C.

===Extinction of the Austrian Habsburgs===
The Austrian branch became extinct in the male line in 1740 with the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] and in the female line in 1780 with the death of his daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]]; it was succeeded by the Vaudemont branch of the [[House of Lorraine]] in the person of her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. The new successor house styled itself formally as [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Habsburg-Lothringen''), although it was often referred to as simply the House of Habsburg. The heiress of the last Austrian Habsburgs Maria Theresa had married [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephan]], [[Duke of Lorraine]]<ref>Maria Theresa was originally engaged to [[Léopold Clément, Hereditary Prince of Lorraine|Léopold Clément of Lorraine]], older brother of Francis Stephan.</ref> (both of them were great-grandchildren of Habsburg Emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], but from different empresses). Their descendants carried on the Habsburg tradition from [[Vienna]] under the dynastic name Habsburg-Lorraine, although technically a new ruling house came into existence in the Austrian territories, the House of Lorraine (see [[Dukes of Lorraine family tree]]). It is thought that extensive intra-family marriages within both lines contributed to their extinctions.

On 6 August 1806 the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved under the French Emperor [[Napoleon I]]'s reorganization of Germany. However, in anticipation of the loss of his title of Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II declared himself hereditary [[Emperor of Austria]] (as Francis I) on 11 August 1804, three months after Napoleon had declared himself Emperor of the French on 18 May 1804.

Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis I]] of Austria used the official full list of titles: "[[Majestic plural|We]], Francis the First, by the grace of God Emperor of Austria; [[Kings of Jerusalem|King of Jerusalem]], [[Hungary]], [[Bohemia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia and Lodomeria]]; Archduke of [[Austria]]; Duke of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Salzburg]], [[Würzburg]], [[Franconia]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], and [[Carniola]]; Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Cracow|Cracow]]; Grand Prince of [[Transylvania]]; Margrave of [[Moravia]]; Duke of [[Sandomir]], [[Masovia]], [[Lublin]], Upper and Lower [[Silesia]], [[Oświęcim|Auschwitz]] and [[Zator]], [[Cieszyn|Teschen]], and [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Friule]]; Prince of [[Berchtesgaden]] and [[Mergentheim]]; Princely Count of Habsburg, [[Gorizia]], and [[Gradisca d'Isonzo|Gradisca]] and of the [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]]; and Margrave of Upper and Lower [[Lusatia]] and [[Istria]]".

The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] created a [[real union]], whereby the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] was granted co-equality with the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]], that henceforth didn't include the Kingdom of Hungary as a [[crownland]] anymore. The Austrian and the Hungarian lands became independent entities enjoying equal status<ref>Microsoft Encarta: The height of the dual monarchy</ref> Under this arrangement, the Hungarians referred to their ruler as king and never emperor (see [[Imperial and Royal|k. u. k.]]).  This prevailed until the Habsburgs' deposition from both Austria and Hungary in 1918 following defeat in World War I.

On 11 November 1918, with his empire collapsing around him, the last Habsburg ruler, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I]] (who also reigned as Charles IV of Hungary) issued a proclamation recognizing Austria's right to determine the future of the state and renouncing any role in state affairs.  Two days later, he issued a separate proclamation for Hungary.  Even though he did not officially [[abdication|abdicate]], this is considered the end of the Habsburg dynasty.  In 1919, the new republican Austrian government subsequently passed a law banishing the Habsburgs from Austrian territory until they renounced all intentions of regaining the throne and accepted the status of private citizens.  Charles made several attempts to regain the throne of Hungary, and in 1921 the Hungarian government passed a law which revoked Charles' rights and dethroned the Habsburgs.

The Habsburgs did not formally abandon all hope of returning to power until [[Otto von Habsburg]], Emperor Charles' eldest son, renounced all claims to the throne.

The dynasty's motto, "Leave the waging of wars to others!  But you, happy Austria, marry; for the realms which [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] awards to others, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] transfers to you.",<ref>Spielvogel, Jackson J. Western Civilization: Comprehensive Volume. 5th ed. Belmont, CA: Thomson/Wadsworth, 2003. 330. Print.</ref> indicates the knack of the Habsburgs to have members intermarry into other royal houses in order to build alliances and inherit territory. [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Empress Maria Theresa]] is recognized quite notably for it and is sometimes referred to as the "Great-Grandmother of Europe".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==Monarchs of the House of Habsburg==
The Habsburg Empire was never composed of a single unified and unitary state as Bourbon France, Hohenzollern Germany, or Great Britain was.  It was made up of an accretion of territories that owed their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord.  The Habsburgs had mostly married the heiresses of these territories, most famously of Spain and the Netherlands.  They used their coats of arms then as a statement of their right to rule all these territories.  As there were many territories, so their arms were complex and reflected the waxing and waning position of the Habsburgs within European power politics.  It was not until the 19th century (see below [[House of Habsburg#Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire|Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) that the arms began to take on their own life as symbols of a state which may have an existence outside of the Habsburg dynasty.  A complete listing of the arms can be found at the [[:fr:Armorial des Habsbourg|Habsburg Armory]].

===Ancestors===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
* [[Guntram, Count of Habsburg|Guntram the Rich]] (ca. 930–985 / 990) Father of:
* [[Lanzelin, Count of Habsburg|Lanzelin]] of [[Altenburg]] (died 991). Besides Radbot, he had sons named [[Rudolph I, Count of Habsburg|Rudolph I]], [[Werner I, Bishop of Strasbourg|Wernher]], and Landolf.

===Counts of Habsburg===
[[File:Rangkronen-Fig. 18.svg|right|100px]]
[[File:Arms of Counts of Habsbourg.svg|thumb|right|100px|Arms of the Counts of Habsburgs. The Habsburgs all but abandoned this for the arms of Austria. It only reappeared in their triarch family arms in 1805.]]

Before [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph]] rose to [[Holy Roman Emperor|German king]], the Habsburgs were [[Count]]s in what is today southwestern Germany and [[Switzerland]].

* [[Radbot, Count of Habsburg|Radbot]] of [[Klettgau]], built the [[Habsburg Castle]] (ca. 985–1035<!--note: sometimes date of death is given as 1045, see http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radbot and http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radbot -->). Besides Werner I, he had two other sons: [[Otto I, Count of Habsburg|Otto I]], who would become Count of [[Sundgau]] in the [[Alsace]], and [[Albert I, Count of Habsburg|Albrecht I]].
* [[Werner I, Count of Habsburg|Werner I]], Count of Habsburg (1025 / 1030–1096). Besides Otto II, there was another son, [[Albert II, Count of Habsburg|Albert II]], who was [[Vogt|reeve]] of [[Muri]] from 1111–1141 after the death of Otto II.
* [[Otto II, Count of Habsburg|Otto II]] of Habsburg; first to name himself as "of Habsburg" (died 1111) Father of:
* [[Werner II, Count of Habsburg|Werner II]] of Habsburg (around 1135; died 1167) Father of:
* [[Albert III, Count of Habsburg|Albrecht III]] of Habsburg (''the Rich''), died 1199. Under him, the Habsburg territories expanded to cover most of what is today the [[German language|German-speaking]] part of [[Switzerland]]. Father of:
* [[Rudolph II, Count of Habsburg|Rudolph II]] of Habsburg (b. c. 1160, died 1232) Father of:
* [[Albert IV, Count of Habsburg|Albrecht IV]] of Habsburg, (died 1239 / 1240); father of Rudolph IV of Habsburg, who would later become king [[Rudolph I of Germany]]. Between [[Albrecht IV]] and his brother [[Rudolph III, Count of Habsburg|Rudolph III]], the Habsburg properties were split, with Albrecht keeping the [[Aargau]] and the western parts, the eastern parts going to Rudolph III. Albrecht IV was also a mutual ancestor of [[Sophia Chotek]] and of her husband [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]

===Dukes/Archdukes of Austria===
[[File:Ducal Hat of Styria.svg|right|100px]]
[[File:Gules a fess argent.svg|thumb|right|100px|The arms of [[:de:Bindenschild|Austria]], originally belonging to the Babenburg dukes. They became all but synonmous with the Habsburgs, as the Habsburgs abandoned their own arms for these.]]

In the late [[Middle Ages]], when the Habsburgs expanded their territories in the east, they often ruled as dukes of the [[Duchy of Austria]] which covered only what is today [[Lower Austria]] (''Niederösterreich'') and the eastern part of [[Upper Austria]] (''Oberösterreich''). The Habsburg possessions also included the rest of what was then called [[Inner Austria]] (''Innerösterreich''), i.e. the [[Duchy of Styria]], and then expanded west to include the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and [[Carniola]] in 1335 and the [[German Tyrol|Count of Tirol]] in 1363. Their original scattered possessions in the southern [[Alsace]], south-western Germany and [[Vorarlberg]] were collectively known as [[Further Austria]].

The senior Habsburg dynast generally ruled [[Lower Austria]] from Vienna as [[archduke]] ("paramount duke") of the [[Duchy of Austria]]. The Styrian lands had already been ruled in [[personal union]] by the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] dukes of [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]] since 1192 and were finally seized with the Austrian lands by the Habsburg king [[Rudolph I of Germany]] upon his victory in the 1278 [[Battle on the Marchfeld]]. In 1335 Rudolph's grandson Duke [[Albert II, Duke of Austria|Albert II of Austria]] also received the Carinthian duchy with the adjacent [[March of Carniola]] at the hands of Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]] as Imperial fiefs.

The Habsburg dukes gradually lost their homelands south of the [[Rhine]] and [[Lake Constance]] to the expanding [[Old Swiss Confederacy]]. Unless mentioned explicitly, the dukes of Austria also ruled over Further Austria until 1379, after that year, Further Austria was ruled by the Princely Count of Tyrol. Names in ''italics'' designate dukes who never actually ruled.

When Albert's son Duke [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria|Rudolf IV of Austria]] in 1365, his younger brothers [[Albert III, Duke of Austria|Albert III]] and [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria|Leopold III]] quarrelled about his heritage and in the [[Treaty of Neuberg]] of 1379 finally split the Habsburg territories: The Albertinian line would rule in the Archduchy of Austria proper (then sometimes referred to as "Lower Austria" (''Niederösterreich''), but comprising modern [[Lower Austria]] and most of [[Upper Austria]]), while the Leopoldian line ruled in the Styrian, Carinthian and Carniolan territories, subsumed under the denotation of "Inner Austria". At that time their share also comprised Tyrol and the original Habsburg possessions in Swabia, called [[Further Austria]]; sometimes both were collectively referred to as "Upper Austria" (''Oberösterreich'') in that context, also not to be confused with the modern state of that name.

After the death of Leopold's eldest son [[William, Duke of Austria|William]] in 1406, the Leopoldinian line was further split among his brothers into the Inner Austrian territory under [[Ernest, Duke of Austria|Ernest the Iron]] and a Tyrolean/Further Austrian line under [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria|Frederick IV]]. In 1457 Ernest's son Duke [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick V]] of Inner Austria also gained the Austrian archduchy after his Albertine cousin [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]] had died without issue. 1490 saw the reunification of all Habsburg lines, when Archduke [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Sigismund]] of Further Austria and Tyrol resigned in favour of Frederick's son [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. In 1512, the Habsburg territories were incorporated into the Imperial [[Austrian Circle]].

''[[Archduke]] of Austria'', was invented in the ''[[Privilegium Maius]]'', a 14th-century forgery initiated by Duke [[Rudolf IV of Austria]]. Originally, it was meant to denote the "ruler" (thus "Arch-") of the [[duchy of Austria]], usually from [[Vienna]], in an effort to put the Habsburgs on a par with the [[Prince-elector]]s, as Austria had been passed as hereditary prince-electors of the empire when the [[Golden Bull of 1356]] assigned that title to the highest ranking [[Imperial prince]]s. The Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] refused to recognise the title.

The archducal title was only officially recognized in 1453 by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Genealogisches Hanbduch des Adels, Furstliche Hauser Band XIV | publisher=C. A. Starke Verlag | year=1991 | location=Limburg ad der Lahn, Germany | pages=91–93 | isbn=3-7980-0700-4}}</ref> Emperor Frederick III himself used just "Duke of Austria", never ''Archduke'', until his death in 1493. The title was first granted to Frederick's younger brother, Albert VI of Austria (died 1463), who used it at least from 1458.

In 1477, Frederick III also granted the title ''archduke'' to his first cousin, [[Sigismund of Austria]], ruler of [[Further Austria]].
Frederick's son and heir, the future [[Emperor Maximilian I]], started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife [[Mary of Burgundy]] (died 1482), as ''Archduke'' never appears in documents issued jointly by Maximilian and Mary as rulers in the [[Low Countries]] (where Maximilian is still titled "Duke of Austria"). The title appears first in documents issued under the joint rule of Maximilian and [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]] (his under-age son) in the Low Countries.

''Archduke'' was initially borne by those dynasts who ruled a [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg territory]], i.e., only by males and their consorts, [[appanage]]s being commonly distributed to [[cadet]]s. But these "junior" ''archdukes'' did not thereby become independent hereditary rulers, since all territories remained vested in the Austrian crown. Occasionally a territory might be combined with a separate gubernatorial mandate ruled by an archducal cadet.

From the 16th century onward, ''archduke'' and its female form, ''archduchess'', came to be used by all the members of the House of Habsburg (e.g., Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] of France was born ''Archduchess Maria Antonia of Austria''.

* ''[[Rudolph II of Austria|Rudolph II]]'', son of [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph I]], duke of Austria and Styria together with his brother 1282–1283, was dispossessed by his brother, who eventually would be murdered by one of Rudolph's sons.
* [[Albert I of Austria|Albert I]] (''Albrecht I''), son of [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph I]] and brother of the above, duke from 1282–1308; was [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from 1298–1308. See also [[#House of Habsburg|below]].
* ''[[Rudolph III of Austria|Rudolph III]]'', oldest son of Albert I, designated duke of Austria and Styria 1298–1307
* [[Frederick I of Austria (Habsburg)|Frederick ''the Handsome'']] (''Friedrich der Schöne''), brother of Rudolph III. Duke of Austria and Styria (with his brother Leopold I) from 1308–1330; officially co-regent of emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] since 1325, but never ruled.
* [[Leopold I of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold I]], brother of the above, duke of Austria and Styria from 1308–1326.
* [[Albert II of Austria|Albert II]] (''Albrecht II''), brother of the above, duke of Further Austria from 1326–1358, duke of Austria and Styria 1330–1358, duke of Carinthia after 1335.
* [[Otto, Duke of Austria|Otto ''the Jolly'']] (''der Fröhliche''), brother of the above, duke of Austria and Styria 1330–1339 (together with his brother), duke of Carinthia after 1335.
* [[Rudolph IV of Austria|Rudolph IV ''the Founder'']] (''der Stifter''), oldest son of Albert II. Duke of Austria and Styria 1358–1365, Duke of [[German Tyrol|Tirol]] after 1363.

After the death of Rudolph IV, his brothers [[Albert III of Austria|Albert III]] and [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III]] ruled the Habsburg possessions together from 1365 until 1379, when they split the territories in the [[Treaty of Neuberg]], Albert keeping the [[Duchy of Austria]] and Leopold ruling over [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Carniola]], the [[Windic March]], [[German Tyrol|Tirol]], and [[Further Austria]].

===Holy Roman Emperors, Archdukes of Austria===
[[Image:Heraldic Imperial Crown (Common).svg|right|75px]]<br/>
[[Image:Archducal Coronet.svg|right|75px]]

The title [[Archduke]] of Austria, the one most famously associated with the Habsburgs, was invented in the [[Privilegium Maius]], a 14th-century forgery initiated by Duke [[Rudolf IV of Austria]]. Originally, it was meant to denote the ruler of the (thus 'Arch')duchy of [[Austria]], in an effort to put that ruler on par with the [[Prince-elector]]s, as Austria had been passed over in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], when the [[Prince-elector|elector]]ships had been assigned. Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] refused to recognize the title. [[Ladislaus the Posthumous]], Duke of Austria, who died in 1457, was never in his lifetime authorized to use it, and accordingly, not he nor anyone in his branch of the dynasty ever used the title.

Duke [[Ernest of Austria (Habsburg)|Ernest the Iron]] and his descendants unilaterally assumed the title "archduke".  This title was only officially recognized in 1453 by his son, [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]], when the [[Habsburg]]s had (permanently) gained control of the office of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Emperor Frederick III himself used just Duke of Austria, never Archduke, until his death in 1493.

Frederick's son and heir, the future [[Emperor Maximilian I]], started to use the title, but apparently only after the death of his wife [[Mary of Burgundy]] (died 1482) as the title never appears in documents of joint Maximilian and Mary rule in the [[Low Countries]] (where Maximilian is still titled Duke of Austria). The title appears first in documents of joint Maximilian and [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]] (his under-age son) rule in the Low Countries. It only gained currency with Charles V and the descendants of his brother, the Emperor Ferdinand.

[[File:Coat of Arms of Philip IV of Burgundy.svg|right|75px]]

The reigning duke of Burgundy, [[Charles the Bold]], was the chief political opponent of Maximilian's father Frederick III. Charles controlled not only Burgundy (both dukedom and county), but the wealthy and powerful [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]], the real center of his power.  Frederick was concerned about Burgundy's expansive tendencies on the western border of his [[Holy Roman Empire]], and to forestall military conflict, he attempted to secure the marriage of Charles's only daughter, [[Mary of Burgundy]], to his son Maximilian. After the [[Siege of Neuss]] (1474–75), he was successful. The wedding between Maximilian and Mary took place on the evening of 16 August 1477, after the death of Charles.<ref name=heimann_frederick>Heinz-Dieter Heimann: Die Habsburger. Dynastie und Kaiserreiche. ISBN 3-406-44754-6. pp. 38–45.</ref>  Mary and the Habsburgs lost the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to France, but managed to defend and hold onto the rest what became the 17 provinces of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]].  After Mary's death in 1482, Maximilian acted as regent for his son:

*[[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], son of Margaret of Parma, governor of the Netherlands, 1578–1592 [[File:Armoiries Parme 1586.svg|50px]]

The Netherlands were frequently governed directly by a [[List of Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands|regent or governor-general]], who was a collateral member of the Habsburgs.  By the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]] Charles V combined the Netherlands into one administrative unit, to be inherited by his son Philip II.  Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity.  The Habsburgs controlled the 17 Provinces of the Netherlands until the [[Dutch Revolt]] in the second half of the 16th century, when they lost the seven northern Protestant provinces.  They held onto the southern Catholic part (roughly modern [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]) as the [[Spanish Netherlands|Spanish]] and [[Austrian Netherlands]] until they were conquered by French Revolutionary armies in 1795.  The one exception to this was the period of (1601–1621), when shortly before [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] died on 13 September 1598, he renounced his rights to the Netherlands in favor of his daughter [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]] and her fiancé, [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Archduke Albert of Austria]], a younger son of Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]].  The territories reverted to Spain on the death of Albert in 1621, as the couple had no surviving offspring, and Isabella acted as regent-governor until her death in 1633:

The main junior line of the house ruled the [[Duchy of Austria]], as well as the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].  The dynasty however was split up again in 1564 among the children of deceased Emperor [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Habsburg]]. The Inner Austrian line founded by Archduke [[Charles II, Archduke of Austria|Charles II]] prevailed again, when his son and successor as regent of [[Inner Austria]] (i.e. the [[Duchy of Styria]], the [[Duchy of Carinola|Duchy of Carniola with March of Istria]], the [[Duchy of Carinthia]], the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, and the [[Trieste|Imperial City of Trieste]], ruled from [[Graz]]) [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] in 1619 became Archduke of Austria and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] as well as [[Kingdom of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1620. The Further Austrian/Tyrolean line of Ferdinand's brother Archduke [[Leopold V, Archduke of Austria|Leopold V]] survived until the death of his son [[Sigismund Francis, Archduke of Further Austria|Sigismund Francis]] in 1665, whereafter their territories ultimately returned to common control with the other Austrian Habsburg lands. Inner Austrian [[stadtholder]]s went on to rule until the days of Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] in the 18th century.

== Kings of Hungary ==
The kingship of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] remained in the Habsburg family for centuries; but as the kingship was not strictly inherited (Hungary was an elective monarchy until 1687) and was sometimes used as a training ground for young Habsburgs, as "Palatine" of Hungary, the dates of rule do not always match those of the primary Habsburg possessions. Therefore, the kings of Hungary are listed separately.

== Kings of Bohemia ==
[[File:Crown of St. Wenceslas.svg|right|90px]]
[[File:Blason Boheme.svg|right|90px]]
The kingship of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] was from 1306 a position elected by its nobles.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} As a result, it was not an automatically inherited position. Until the rule of Ferdinand I, Habsburgs didn't gain hereditary accession to the throne and were displaced by other dynasties. Hence, the kings of Bohemia and their ruling dates are listed separately. The Habsburgs became hereditary kings of Bohemia in 1627. By their acquisition of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] in 1526 the Habsburgs secured the highest rank among the secular prince-electors of the Holy Roman Empire.

== Family name Habsburg ==
Most royal families did not have a family name until the 19th century. They were known as "of" (in German von) based on the main territory they ruled.  For example, sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters of a ruling French King were known as "of France" (see [[House of Bourbon#Surnames used|Wikipedia on House of Bourbon]]).  The name "Capet" was an invention of the French Revolutionaries.  "Bourbon" was in some sense the name of the house as it was differentiated from the previous Valois kings.  Princes and Princesses of the royal house of England were known as "of England", or later "Great Britain" (see [[House of Windsor]]) or "of" the main title associated with their parent (see [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William of Wales]]). In the Middle Ages, princes of England were often known by the town or castle of their birth (see [[John of Gaunt]], [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke]], or [[Henry V of England|Henry of Monmouth]]). Even when the royal family had a last name (see [[House of Tudor]], [[House of Stuart]] or [[House of Windsor]]), it was not used in their titles.

Similarly, the Habsburg name was used as one of the subsidiary titles of the rulers above, as in "Princely Count of Habsburg" (see above under Habsburg-Lorraine).  The Habsburg arms (see above) were displayed only in the most complete (great arms) of the prince.  The dynasty was known as the "house of Austria".  Most of the princes above were known as Archduke xyz "of Austria" and had no need of a surname. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] was known in his youth after his birthplace as "Charles of Ghent".  When he became king of the Spains he was known as "Charles of Spain", until he became emperor, when he was known as Charles V ("Charles Quint").  In Spain, the dynasty was known as the [[:es:casa de Austria|"casa de Austria"]], and illegitimate sons were given the title of "de Austria" (see [[John of Austria|Don Juan de Austria]] and [[John of Austria the Younger|Don Juan José de Austria]]).  The arms displayed in their simplest form were those of Austria, which the Habsburgs had made their own, at times impaled with the arms of the Duchy of Burgundy (ancient).

When Maria Theresa married the duke of Lorraine, Francis Stephen (see above), there was a desire to show that the ruling dynasty continued as did all its inherited rights, as the ruling dynasty's right to rule was based on inherited legitimate birthright in each of the constituent territories.  Using the concept of "Habsburg" as the traditional Austrian ruler was one of those ways.  When Francis I became Emperor of Austria, there was an even further reinforcement of this by the reappearance of the arms of Habsburg in the tripart personal arms of the house with Austria and Lorraine.  This also reinforced the "Germaness" of the Austrian Emperor and his claim to rule in Germany against the Prussian Kings, or at least to be included in "Germany".  As Emperor Francis Joseph wrote to Napoleon III „Nein, ich bin ein deutscher Fürst“ <ref>1: [[Wolfgang Menzel (Literaturhistoriker)|Wolfgang Menzel]]: ''Die letzten 120 Jahre der Weltgeschichte'', Band 6 (1740-1860), Adolph Krabbe, Stuttgart 1860, S. 211 {{Google Buch|BuchID=NQAIAAAAIAAJ|Seite=211|Hervorhebung=deutscher Fürst|Linktext=Online}}<br />2.: Wolfgang Menzel: ''Supplementband zu der Geschichte der letzten 40 Jahre (1816-1856).''

Today, as the dynasty is no longer on the throne, the surname of members of the house is taken to be "von Habsburg" or more completely "von Habsburg-Lothringen" (see [[Otto von Habsburg]] and [[Karl von Habsburg]]).  Princes and members of the house use the Tripartite arms shown above, generally forgoing any imperial pretentions.

== Arms of Dominion of the Austro-Hungarian Empire ==
The arms of dominion began to take on a life of their own in the 19th century as the idea of the state as independent from the Habsburg dynasty took root.  They are the national arms as borne by a sovereign in his capacity as head of state and represent the state as separate from the person of the monarch or his dynasty.  That very idea had been, here to fore, foreign to the concept of the Habsburg state.  The state had been the personal property of the Habsburg dynast.  Since the states, territories, and nationalities represented were in many cases only united to the Austro-Hungarian Empire by their historic loyalty to the head of the house of Habsburg as hereditary lord, these full ("grand") arms of dominion of Austria-Hungary reflect the complex political infrastructure that was necessarily to accommodate the many different nationalities and groupings within the empire after the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]].

[[File:Imperial Coat of Arms of the Empire of Austria.svg|thumb|left|360px|Shield of the Austrian part of the empire (1867–1915).]]
[[File:Coat of arms of Austria-Hungary with numbers 1867-1915.png|thumb|left|360px|Enumeration]]

After 1867 the eastern part of the empire, also called [[Transleithania]], was mostly under the domination of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].  The shield integrated the [[Coat of Arms of Hungary|arms of the kingdom of Hungary]], with two angels and supporters and the crown of St. Stephen, along with the territories that were subject to it:

The [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] (conjoined with Croatia as the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] - formally known as the [[Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia]], although the claim to Dalmatia was mostly [[de jure]]), the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Great Principality of Transylvania]], the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1915–1918), the [[Corpus separatum (Fiume)|City of Fiume and its district]] (modern [[Rijeka]]), and in the center, the Kingdom of Hungary.

The western or Austrian part of the empire, ''[[Cisleithania]]'', continued using the shield of the Empire in 1815 but with the seals of various member territories located around the central shield. Paradoxically, some of these coats of arms belonged to the territories that were part of the Hungarian part of the empire and shield. This shield, the most frequently used until 1915, was known as the middle shield. There was also the small shield, with just the personal arms of the Habsburgs, as used in 1815.

=== Version of 1915 ===
In 1915, in the middle of World War I, Austria-Hungary adopted a heraldic composition uniting the shield that was used in the Hungarian part, also known as the [[Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen]], with a new version of the medium shield of the Austrian part as depicted above in the section on the main line of the Emperors of Austria.

Before 1915, the arms of the different territories of the Austrian part of the Empire (heraldry was added to some areas not shown in the previous version and to the left to the Hungarian part) appeared together in the shield positioned on the double-headed eagle coat of arms of the Austrian Empire as an inescutcheon. The eagle was inside a shield with a gold field. The latter shield was supported by two griffins and was topped by the Austrian Imperial Crown (previously these items were included only in the large shield). Then, shown in the center of both arms of dominion, as an inescutcheon to the inescutcheon, is the small shield, i.e. personal arms, of the Habsburgs. All this was surrounded by the collar [[Order of the Golden Fleece]]<ref>H. Ströhl: ''Die neuen österreichischen, ungarischen und gemeinsamen Wappen. Hrsg. auf Grund der mit d. allerhöchsten Handschreiben vom 10. u. 11. Okt. 1915, bezw. 2. u. 5. März 1916 erfolgten Einführung.'' Viena 1917.</ref><ref name="DIEM">{{cite web |url=http://peter-diem.at/History/doppeladler.htm |title=Diem, P. ''Die Entwicklung des österreichischen Doppeladlers'' |deadurl=no |accessdate=5 July 2012}}</ref>

[[File:Wappen Österreichische Länder 1915 (Mittel).png|thumb|center|600px|Middle Coat of arms of the Austrian part of the Empire in 1915. It shows as a center shield (inescutcheon) the personal arms of Habsburg-Lorraine over the arms of dominions of the Habsburg lands. It usually had the personal arms of Habsburg-Lorraine in the center.]]

In the heraldic composition of 1915, the shields of the two foci of the empire, Austria and Hungary, were brought together. The griffin supporter on the left was added for Austria and an angel on the right as a supporter for Hungary. The center featured the personal arms of the Habsburgs (Habsburg, Austria and Lorraine). This small shield was topped with a royal crown and surrounded by the collar of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], below which was the [[Military Order of Maria Theresa]], below which was the collars of the Orders of [[Order of Saint Stephen of Hungary|St. Stephen's]] and [[Order of Leopold (Austria)|Leopold]]. At the bottom was the motto that read "AC INDIVISIBILITER INSEPARABILITER" ("indivisible and inseparable"). There were other simplified versions which did not have the supports depicted, and the simple shields of Austria and Hungary.  These were the arms of the Empire of Austria with an inescutcheon of Austria, and the Arms of Hungary (with chequer of Croatia at the tip).
