==History==

===Pre-independence===
Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C. was originally established in 1923, but was disbanded soon after. The club was re-formed in 1925, and then for a third time in May 1926.<ref name=history>[http://hapoelta-fc.co.il/en/club/history] Hapoel Tel Aviv F.C.</ref> In 1927 the club merged with Allenby F.C., giving the club its modern form. It is part of the [[Hapoel]] sports association which was affiliated with the [[Histadrut]] trade union, and supporters of the club were often referred to as communists.<ref>[http://crwflags.com/fotw/flags/il@hapta.html Hapoel Tel-Aviv Football Club (Israel)] Flags of the World</ref>

In 1928 the club reached the [[1928 Palestine Cup|Palestine Cup]] final (the first one to be recognised by the [[Israel Football Association]]). Although they beat Maccabi Hasmonean Jerusalem 2–0, Hapoel fielded an ineligible player, resulting in the cup being shared.<ref name=cup>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/isracuphist.html Israel – List of Cup Finals] RSSSF</ref>

The [[1933–34 Palestine League|1933–34]] saw the club win the double,<ref name=champs>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/israchamp.html Israel – List of Champions] RSSSF</ref> finishing as champions of the [[Palestine League]], winning every match, the only Israeli club to have achieved such a feat,<ref name=history/> and winners of the cup, beating local rivals Maccabi Tel Aviv 3–2 in the final. The [[1934–35 Palestine League|1934–35]] season saw Hapoel led the league table, but the championship was abandoned and they were not declared champions.<ref name=champs/> The [[1937-38 Palestine League|1937–38]] season ended the same way, with Hapoel top of the league, but the season abandoned. In the meantime, the club won the cup again in 1937, 1938 and 1939, and remain the only club to have won the trophy in three successive seasons (although the [[Royal Air Force]] won it four years in a row between 1924 and 1927, pre-1928 wins are not recognised by the IFA).

In [[1939-40 Palestine League|1939–40]] they won their second championship. The following season no national championships were held, but the club won the tournament for Hapoel-affiliated clubs. They won a third championship in the 1943–44 season, and in the following year won the northern region league,<ref name=champs/> as well as what became known as the "War Cup", which was boycotted by
[[Beitar]]-affiliated clubs. In the cup final Hapoel were leading [[Hapoel Petah Tikva F.C.|Hapoel Petah Tikva]] 1–0, but the match was abandoned on 89 minutes when a Petah Tikva player refused to leave the pitch after being sent off for insulting the referee.<ref name=cup/>

===Post-independence===
[[Image:Derbi2005-06.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Pyrotechnics at the [[Tel Aviv derby]], 2005–06]]
Following [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|Israeli independence]], Hapoel joined the new [[Israeli League 1949-50|Israeli League]]. They won the title in [[Liga Leumit 1956-57|1956–57]] and the State Cup in 1961, beating Hapoel Petah Tikva 2–1.

In the [[Liga Leumit 1965-66|1965–66 season]] Hapoel won the title, and qualified for the first Asian Club Championships. In [[Asian Club Championship 1967|the tournament]] Hapoel were given byes all the way to the final, where they beat [[Selangor FA|Selangor]] 2–1 to become Asia's first club champions. The club also reached the State Cup final that year, but lost 2–1 to Maccabi Tel Aviv.

Hapoel won the title again in [[Liga Leumit 1968-69|1968–69]], and again qualified for the Asian Club championships. Although they reached the final, they lost 2–1 to [[Iran]]ian side [[Esteghlal F.C.|Taj Club]] (in an era when Iran and Israel had diplomatic relations). They won the State Cup again in 1972, beating [[Hapoel Jerusalem F.C.|Hapoel Jerusalem]] 1–0 in the final, but did not win the title again until [[Liga Leumit 1980-81|1980–81]], when they missed out on the double after losing the cup final 4–3 on penalties (after a 2–2 draw) to [[Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.|Bnei Yehuda]]. The following season they reached the cup final again, but lost 1–0 to [[Hapoel Yehud F.C.|Hapoel Yehud]]. A hat-trick of cup final defeats was avoided when they beat Maccabi Tel Aviv 3–2 in the 1982 final.

Another title was won in [[Liga Leumit 1985-86|1985–86]], and another in [[Liga Leumit 1987-88|1987–88]]. However, the following season Hapoel finished bottom of the league (with a four-point deduction for breaking budget rules) and were relegated to the [[Liga Artzit|second tier]] for the first time in their history.

The club made an immediate return to the top division as Liga Artzit runners-up, though they only beat [[Maccabi Yavne F.C.|Maccabi Yavne]] to the second promotion slot on [[goal difference]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/isra90.html Israel 1989/90] RSSSF</ref> In [[Liga Leumit 1997-98|1997–98]] Hapoel finished second, and qualified for Europe for the second time. In the [[UEFA Cup 1998-99|1998–99 UEFA Cup]] Hapoel knocked out [[FinnPa]], before losing on penalties to [[Strømsgodset I.F.|Strømsgodset]]. In the same season they won the State Cup, beating [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]] 3–1 on penalties after a 1–1 draw.

===21st Century===
The [[Israeli Premier League 1999-00|1999–2000 season]] saw Hapoel win the double, claiming their first title in over a decade and winning the State Cup (beating Beitar Jerusalem on penalties again). However, they failed to reach the group stages of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] after being beaten 5–1 on aggregate by [[SK Sturm Graz|Sturm Graz]]. They finished second in the league in [[Israeli Premier League 2000-01|2000–01]] and [[Israeli Premier League 2001-02|2001–02]] and third in [[Israeli Premier League 2002-03|2002–03]], qualifying for the UEFA Cup on each occasion. In the [[UEFA Cup 2001–02|2001–02 UEFA Cup]] Hapoel reached the quarter-finals after knocking out [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]]. Although they beat [[A.C. Milan]] 1–0 in the home leg (a match which had to be played in the [[GSP Stadium]] in Cyprus as UEFA did not allow matches to be held in Israel due to security reasons), Hapoel lost the away leg 2–0.

In 2002 the club won its first [[Toto Cup]]. They won the State Cup in 2006, beating Bnei Yehuda 1–0 in the final, and also won it the following season, when they defeated second division [[Hapoel Ashkelon F.C.|Hapoel Ashkelon]] on penalties. They reached the final again in 2007–08, but lost 5–4 on penalties to Beitar Jerusalem after a 0–0 draw.

In [[2009–10 Israeli Premier League|2009–10]], the club won the double, claiming the [[2009–10 Israel State Cup|State Cup]] after a 3–1 victory over [[Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv F.C.|Bnei Yehuda]]. The title was won after a dramatic game against [[Beitar Jerusalem F.C.|Beitar Jerusalem]] on the final day of the season, with [[Eran Zahavi]] scoring the title winning goal two minutes into injury time. The club also had a successful season in the [[2009-10 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]], winning their group, before losing to [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]] in the second round. The following season they reached the group stages of the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the first time,but failed to advance to the next round. at the same season the team reached to the second place and won the [[Israeli State Cup]] for the second time in row.

In the beginning of season [[2011–12 Israeli Premier League|2011–12]] Most of the successful players of the team left and spread at Europe, also the Team's manager [[Eli Guttman]] left too. The club's legendary coach, [[Dror Kashtan]], returned and new players came as part of the transfer of ownership of the club to Eli Tabib. During the season there was tension between the manager [[Dror Kashtan]] and Eli Tabib, which led to the manager's departure and current Manager was appointed in his place, [[Nitzan Shirazi]], who led the team winning the [[Israeli State Cup]] for the third time in a row. After large-scale protests of the fans against the club's owner Tabib and his unprofessional conduct, he decided to leave the club after one year and sold it to [[Haim Ramon]] and to the [[supporters' trust]] called "Haadumim", "The Reds" in Hebrew, that establish at the summer of 2012 and raise 2 million shekel for 20% of the ownership. The other part of the club sold to several other businessmen. all together the club sold at summer 2012 for 12 million [[New Israeli Shekel|NIS]] (about [[American Dollar|$]] 3 Million).                            
At the beginning of season [[2012–13 Israeli Premier League|2012–13]], [[Yossi Abuksis]] was appointed coach in place of Nitzan Shirazi, who appointed professional manager due to his health reasons. On July 1, 2015, the club was bought by [[Amir Gross Kabiri]].

==Stadium==
[[File:HapoelFans3.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Hapoel T.A. at Gate 5 in Bloomfield Stadium]]
{{Main|Bloomfield Stadium}}
After playing at three different stadiums, the club moved to the old [[Bloomfield Stadium]] in 1949, after the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. In 1962 the ground was renovated using donation from the Bloomfield family, thus receiving it's official name. The ground was owned by Tel-Aviv histadrut branch, who were also owners of Hapoel, although today it is a municipal stadium.

The stadium, located in Jaffa, is an upgraded version of the older stadium called "Basa". The first match at the new Bloomfield was played on 12 December 1962 against [[FC Twente]], the game ending in a 1–1 draw. The stadium is currently shared with city rivals Maccabi (who moved to the ground in 2000) and Bnei Yehuda (since 2004).

Hapoel main fans' gate is gate 5, where Ultras Hapoel leads the chirring, and away crowds sit oppositely, on Gate 11.

==Supporters and politics==
The team is the standard-bearer of the Israeli left. It was the last club to cut formal links with politics, in this case the trade union movement and Labour Party, and the two communist parties [[Mapam]] and [[Maki (political party)|Maki]].

Ultras Hapoel, the sole fan organization, unroll banners emblazoned with the faces of [[Che Guevara]] and [[Karl Marx]], and banners with the political slogan "[[Workers of the world, unite!]]".<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/d6849396-ef64-11de-86c4-00144feab49a.html The not-so-beautiful Game of Football in Israel] [[Financial Times]], 2 January 2010</ref> The club ultras has a friendship with [[antifa]] supporter groups all over the world and strong bonds with fans of [[FC St. Pauli]], [[Standard Liège]], [[Omonia Nicosia]] and [[Celtic F.C.]].

Hapoel two bitters rivals are Maccabi Tel Aviv, whose game against them consist of the [[Tel Aviv derby]], and Beitar Jerusalem, which is considered the team of the Israeli right wing- both Revisionist and Kahanist.

A ''[[Haaretz]]'' poll published on June 2011 identified Hapoel Tel Aviv as the second most popular football team among [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]], behind [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]].<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/sports/soccer-mad-pro-hatikva-1.370388 Soccer-mad, pro-'Hatikva']</ref>

Another survey had been conducted in March 2012 by [[Yedioth]] showed that Hapoel is the fourth most popular team among Israeli football fans (nineteen percent). Same survey revealed that thirty-two percent of Tel Aviv residents support the team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kuper|first=Uri|title=The real national team?|url=http://www.one.co.il/Msites/Biz/InsideArticle.aspx?id=197109|publisher=one.co.il|language=Hebrew}}</ref>
