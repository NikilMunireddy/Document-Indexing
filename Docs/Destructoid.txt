'''''Destructoid''''' is a [[Webby Award]]-winning independent [[video game]]-focused [[blog]] that was founded in March 2006 by Yanier Gonzalez.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-turns-one-30430.phtml |title=Destructoid turns one |accessdate=2009-08-11 |last=Gonzalez |first=Yanier "Niero" |date=2007-03-15 |publisher=Destructoid}}</ref> It is part of the ModernMethod network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernmethod.com/destructoid-press.htm |title=MODERNMETHOD / DESTRUCTOID LLC - A swell company of fine hypertext products |publisher=Modernmethod.com |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernmethod.com/ |title=Who Is Modernmethod? |publisher=Modernmethod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref> Since 2008, ''Destructoid'' has organized annual charities in conjunction with their gaming activity, the first ever charity was an organized gaming marathon that raised money for children with cancer.

Mr. Destructoid, the mascot for the organization, has appeared in various video games starting with [[Bomberman Live]] in 2007.

==History==
''Destructoid'' was owned by Yanier Gonzalez so that he could attend the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/05/12/waiting-for-wii-and-ill-form-the-head/ |title=Waiting for Wii: And I'll form the head! |last=Kietzmann |first=Ludwig |date=2006-05-12 |publisher=[[Joystiq]] |accessdate=2013-07-08}}</ref> After initially being rejected, Gonzalez began writing original editorials and drawing cartoons which were picked up by established gaming blogs like ''[[Joystiq]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2006/04/04/quad-sli-gaming-for-cheapskates/ |title=Quad SLI gaming for Cheapskates |accessdate=2011-06-30 }}</ref> and ''[[Kotaku]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/164054/destructoid-annihilates-360-stock-with-humor?tag=destructoid |title=Destructoid's First Comic |accessdate=2011-06-30 }}</ref> In 2007 the site relaunched with user blogs, forums, and a team of contributors.

After E3, Gonzalez appeared at the press conference dressed as Mr. Destructoid (''Destructoid''{{'s}} robot [[mascot]], shown on logos and promotional material) to hand out promotional flyers. Gonzalez was the first to break the news of [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]]'s disbarment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamepolitics.com/2006/10/12/destructroid-scores-big-with-bully-courtroom-coverage |title=Destructoid Scores Big with Bully Courtroom Coverage |accessdate=2011-06-30 }}</ref>   

''Destructoid'' posts an average of 50 stories a day. It was among the first to break stories such as the [[Wii|Nintendo Wii]] controller's final design,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digg.com/news/story/The_evolution_of_the_Nintendo_Wii_remote:_Before_After_prototype_photos |title=Nintendo Wii Remote Prototype Evolution |accessdate=2011-06-30 }}</ref> the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 3]]'s price at launch<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digg.com/news/story/August_1st_Xbox_360_199US_PS3_599US_Console_Warz_is_OVER |title=Xbox 360 199 US, PS3 599 US |accessdate=2011-06-30 }}</ref> and ''[[Halo 3]]''{{'}}s release date. Its original editorial work gained mainstream syndication including the web show ''[[Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'?]]'', now syndicated on [[GameTrailers]].  Other works were picked up by social bookmarking sites like the satirical Ten Golden Rules of Online Gaming,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digg.com/news/story/Ten_golden_rules_of_online_gaming |title=Ten Golden Rules of Online Gaming |accessdate=2011-06-30 }}</ref> its Guides on Recognizing Gamers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digg.com/news/story/A_Guide_To_Recognizing_Your_Gamers_Chapter_3 |title=Guides on recognizing gamers |accessdate=2011-06-30 }}</ref>

The Mr. Destructoid costume was redesigned in 2012 by [[Volpin Props]], featuring animated [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] circuitry, and is still active as their mascot at press events.

==Features==
''Destructoid'' is split up into six main sections: the Homepage where editors post daily news and reviews, the Community Blogs, the Videos section which consist of original skits and trailers, the chat Forums, the Buy/Sell area where community members trade games, and the Fight area where members can play games against each other.

From 2010 to 2013, ''Destructoid'' produced the twice-weekly, in-studio video game news show, the Destructoid Show on Revision 3,<ref name="Revision 3 Show">{{cite web | title=The Destructoid Show | url=http://www.revision3.com/destructoid }}</ref> daily live video streams like Kingdom of Foom and MASH TacticS <ref name="Destructoid Live Chill Bros">{{cite web | title=The Destructoid Show | url=http://www.twitch.tv/destructoid }}</ref> on Twitch.tv, and semi-regular video skits like Hey Ash Whatcha Playin, The Jimquisition, Storm's Adventures, and others on YouTube.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

''Destructoid'' reviews editor [[Jim Sterling]] ran a weekly podcast with associate editor Jonathan Holmes and Conrad Zimmerman. When Jim Sterling left Destructoid, the podcast was taken over by a new host with much less frequent updates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Charitable work==
In 2008, Jim Sterling, a ''Destructoid'' editor, took part in a sponsored gaming marathon raising money for young [[cancer]] patients. Raising $3,000 for the charity, Sterling and friend John Kershaw played a selection of games from the [[SingStar]] franchise, effectively singing almost non-stop for twelve hours. The event was broadcast live online for the duration of the event.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/10/destructoid-editor-to-sing-for-charity.ars |title=Destructoid editor to sing for charity| accessdate=2009-08-11 |date=2008-10-03| publisher=Ars Technica}}</ref>

In 2009, Niero, and other ''Destructoid'' editors continued the gaming marathon tradition on October 17–18 for cancer awareness raising $4,835.60 for [[Extra Life (charity)|Extra Life]] children's hospital in [[Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waystogive.texaschildrens.org/netcommunity/destructoid |title=Texas Children's Hospital - Ways to Give |publisher=Waystogive.texaschildrens.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-03}}</ref>

==Presence in video games==
The site's mascot, Mr. Destructoid, has appeared in various console, mobile, and PC video games.

In 2007, it was announced that [[Hudson Soft#Hudson_Entertainment.2C_Inc.|Hudson Entertainment]], the American branch of [[Hudson Soft]] had teamed up with ''Destructoid'' to develop and introduce a playable character based on Destructoid's mascot, Mr. Destructoid, into its [[Xbox Live Arcade]] game ''[[Bomberman Live]]''.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Hudson Partners With Destructoid In Bomb-Up pack 2 For Bomberman Live |publisher=[[Hudson Soft]] |date=2007-09-19 |url=http://www.hudsonentertainment.com/newsdetail.php?news_id=108 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Susan |last=Arendt |title=Destructoid Mascot Added to ''Bomberman Live'' |url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/09/destructoid-mas.html |publisher=[[Wired News]]|date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Mike|last=Fahey|title=Destructoid Makes Bomberman Live Appearance |url=http://kotaku.com/301353/destructoid-makes-bomberman-live-appearance |publisher=Kotaku|date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Hudson Partners With Destructoid In Bomb-Up Pack 2 For Bomberman Live |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/hudson-partners-with-destructoid-in-bomb-up-pack-2-for-bomberman-live |publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}</ref> Mr. Destructoid later appeared in ''[[Bomberman Ultra]]'', the PlayStation 3 port of Bomberman Live. Mr. Destructoid's head is available as an unlockable helmet in [[PixelJAM Games|PixelJAM]]'s game ''[[Dino Run]]'', by entering the password "[[Totino's|totinos]]" in the cheats menu.  This was included as an in-joke, because that particular brand of pizza was a favorite of one of the editors, and he in turn was a friend of the game's developers. The code was revealed in one chapter of the Podtoid podcast.

In 2008, ''Destructoid''{{'s}} mascot was also included in the [[platform game]] ''[[Eternity's Child]]'', but was later removed  after a scathing review of the game on the web site.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eternity’s Child Versus Destructoid |first=Kieron| last=Gillen| url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/08/04/eternitys-child-versus-destructoid/
