'''Derbyshire''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-derbyshire.ogg|ˈ|d|ɑr|b|ɪ-|ʃ|ər}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɑr|b|ɪ|ʃ|ɪər}}; abbreviated '''Derbys.''' or '''Derbs.''') is a county in the [[East Midlands]] of England. A substantial portion of the [[Peak District|Peak District National Park]] lies within Derbyshire. The southern extremity of the [[Pennines|Pennine range]] of hills extends into the north of the county. The county contains part of the [[The National Forest (England)|National Forest]], and borders on [[Greater Manchester]] to the northwest, [[West Yorkshire]] to the north, [[South Yorkshire]] to the northeast, [[Nottinghamshire]] to the east, [[Leicestershire]] to the southeast, [[Staffordshire]] to the west and southwest and [[Cheshire]] also to the west.
[[Kinder Scout]], at 636 metres (2,087&nbsp;ft), is the highest point in the county, whilst Trent Meadows, where the [[River Trent]] leaves Derbyshire, is its lowest point at 27 metres (89&nbsp;ft).{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=1}}<ref name="Experiencing the Highs and Lows">{{cite web|last1=Haran|first1=Brady|authorlink=Brady Haran|title=Experiencing the Highs and Lows|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/3827507.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=28 September 2015}}</ref> The [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] is the county's longest river at 66 miles (106&nbsp;km), and runs roughly north to south through the county.<ref name=os>{{Cite map | publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]] | title = 1:50 000 Scale Colour Raster | year = 2000 }}</ref> In 2003 the [[Ordnance Survey]] placed Church Flatts Farm at [[Coton in the Elms]] (near [[Swadlincote]]) as the furthest point from the sea in Great Britain.<ref name="BBC">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/derbyshire/3090539.stm BBC report centre of England]</ref><ref name="OS">[http://mapzone.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/mapzone/didyouknow/whereis/q_16_63.html Ordnance Survey – MapZone]</ref>

The city of [[Derby]] is a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority area]], but remains part of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Derbyshire. The [[non-metropolitan county]] contains 30 towns with between 10,000 and 100,000 inhabitants. There is a large amount of sparsely populated agricultural upland: 75% of the population live in 25% of the area. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==History==

{{See also|History of Derbyshire}}

The area that is now Derbyshire was first visited, probably briefly, by humans 200,000 years ago during the Aveley [[interglacial]] as evidenced by a [[Middle Paleolithic]] [[Acheulean]] hand axe found near [[Hopton, Derbyshire|Hopton]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=''A Palaeolith from Hopton,'' Derbyshire Archaeological Journal 79|publisher=Cockerton, R. W. P.|pages=153–155|year=1954 }}</ref>

Further occupation came with the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] periods of the Stone Age when [[Mesolithic]] hunter gatherers roamed the hilly tundra.<ref>Smith, p. 6</ref>
Evidence of these nomadic tribes has been found in [[limestone]] caves located on the Nottinghamshire border. Deposits left in the caves date the occupancy at around 12,000 to 7,000 [[Common Era|BCE]].<ref name=pevsner22>Pevsner, p. 22</ref>

[[File:Arbor low 274167 560a8cc3.jpg|thumb|left|The henge monument at [[Arbor Low]]]]
Burial mounds of Neolithic settlers are also situated throughout the county. These [[chamber tomb|chambered tombs]] were designed for collective burial and are mostly located in the central Derbyshire region.<ref name=pevsner22/> There are tombs at [[Minninglow]] and [[Five Wells]] that date back to between 2000 and 2500 BCE.<ref>Smith, p. 7</ref> Three miles west of [[Youlgreave]] lies the Neolithic [[henge|henge monument]] of [[Arbor Low]], which has been dated to 2500 BCE.

It is not until the [[Bronze Age]] that real signs of agriculture and settlement are found in the county. In the moors of the Peak District signs of clearance, arable fields and [[hut circle]]s were discovered after archaeological investigation. However this area and another settlement at [[Swarkestone]] are all that have been found.<ref name=smith8>Smith, p. 8</ref>

During the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman invasion]] the invaders were attracted to Derbyshire because of the [[Derbyshire lead mining history|lead ore]] in the limestone hills of the area. They settled throughout the county with forts built near [[Brough and Shatton|Brough]] in the [[Hope Valley, Derbyshire|Hope Valley]] and [[Ardotalia|near Glossop]]. Later they settled around [[Buxton]], famed for its warm springs, and set up [[Derventio Coritanorum|a fort]] near modern-day [[Derby]] in an area now known as [[Little Chester]].<ref name=smith8/>

Several kings of [[Mercia]] are buried in the [[Repton]] area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.derbyshireuk.net/repton.html |title=Repton in Derbyshire |accessdate=7 January 2008 |work=Derbyshire UK}}</ref>

Following the [[Norman Conquest]], much of the county was subject to the forest laws. To the northwest was the [[Forest of High Peak]] under the custodianship of [[William Peverel]] and his descendants. The rest of the county was bestowed upon [[Henry de Ferrers]], a part of it becoming [[Duffield Frith]]. In time the whole area was given to the [[Duchy of Lancaster]]. Meanwhile, the [[Forest of East Derbyshire]] covered the whole county to the east of the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] from the reign of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] to that of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/ar/research/projects/eastmidsfw/pdfs/26deras.pdf |title=Derbyshire County Council, East Midlands Archaeological Research Framework: Resource Assessment of Medieval Derbyshire|accessdate=7 January 2008 |format=PDF |author=Barret, Dave}}</ref>

==Geography==

Most of Derbyshire consists of rolling hills, with the southern [[Pennines]] extending from the north of [[Derby]] throughout the [[Peak District]] and into the north of the county, reaching a high point at [[Kinder Scout]]. The south and east of the county are generally lower around the valley of the [[River Trent]], the Coal Measures, and the areas of clay and sandstones between the Peak District and the south west of the county. The main rivers in the county are the [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|River Derwent]] and the [[River Dove, Central England|River Dove]] which both join the River Trent in the south. The River Derwent rises in the moorland of [[Bleaklow]] and flows throughout the Peak District and county for the majority of its course, while the River Dove rises in [[Axe Edge Moor]] and forms a boundary between Derbyshire and [[Staffordshire]] for most of its length.
  
=== Landscape character ===
[[File:South Wingfield Church flooded.jpg|thumb|Flooding in [[South Wingfield]] Derbyshire in 2012]]

The varied landscapes within Derbyshire's have been formed mainly as a consequence of the underlying geology, but also by the way the land has been managed and shaped by human activity. The county contains 11 discrete landscape types, known as [[National character area|National Character Areas]], which have been described in detail by Natural England <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-character-area-profiles-data-for-local-decision-making |title=National Character Area profiles: data for local decision making | publisher=Natural England |accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> and further refined, mapped and described by Derbyshire County Council<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/environment/conservation/landscapecharacter/ |title=Landscape Character | publisher=Derbyshire County Council | date=2013 |accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> and the Peak District National Park.<ref>[http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/looking-after/strategies-and-policies/landscape-strategy "Landscape Strategy"] Peak District National Park, retrieved 20 August 2015</ref>

The 11 National Character Areas found within Derbyshire are:
* [[Dark Peak]]
* [[White Peak]]
* South West Peak
* Derbyshire Peak Fringe & Lower Derwent
* Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire & Yorkshire Coalfield
* Southern Magnesian Limestone
* Needwood & South Derbyshire Claylands
* Trent Valley Washlands
* Melbourne Parklands
* [[Leicestershire & South Derbyshire Coalfield]]
*  Mease/Sence Lowlands

=== Geology ===
From a geological perspective, Derbyshire's solid geology can be split into two very different halves. The oldest rocks occur in the northern, more upland half of the county, and are mostly of [[Carboniferous]] age, comprising limestones, gritstones, sandstones and shales. In its north-east corner to the east of [[Bolsover]] there are also [[Magnesian Limestone]] rocks of Permian age. In contrast, the southern and more lowland half of Derbyshire contains much softer rocks, mainly mudstones and sandstones of Permo-Triassic age, which create gentler, more rolling landscapes with few rock outcrops. Across both regions can be found drift deposits of [[Quaternary]] age - mainly terrace and river gravel deposits and boulder clays. Landslip features are found on unstable layers of sandstones and shales, with [[Mam Tor]] and [[Alport Castles]] being the most well-known. Cemented screes and [[tufa]] deposits occur very rarely in the limestone dales and rivers, whilst underground cave systems have been created naturally in the limestone since Pleistocene times. The recent discovery of a system near [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]], named   [[Titan (cave)|Titan]], is now known to have the deepest shaft and biggest chamber of any cave in Britain.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|work=BBC News|title=Cave boasts UK's biggest chamber |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/leicestershire/6122884.stm |accessdate=18 August 2015|date=8 November 2006}}</ref>

The oldest rocks are Lower Carboniferous limestones of [[Dinantian]] age, which form the core of the White Peak within the Peak District National Park. Because northern Derbyshire is effectively an uplifted dome of rock layers which have subsequently eroded back to expose older rocks in the centre of that dome, these are encircled by progressively younger limestone rocks until they in turn give way on three sides to Upper Carboniferous shales, gritstones and sandstones of [[Namurian]] age.

[[File:Peak District Cross Section.gif|400px|thumb|center|A cross-section of northern Derbyshire, from west to east, showing the approximate structure of an eroded dome, with younger Coal Measure rocks to the east, and older limestone exposed in the centre]]

Younger still are the sandstones, shales and coal deposits found on the eastern flank of Derbyshire, forming the Coal Measures, which are of [[Westphalian (stage)|Westphalian]] age. All these rock layers disappear south of a line drawn between Ashbourne and Derby under layers of clays  and sandstones ([[Mercia Mudstone Group]] and [[Sherwood Sandstone Group|Sherwood Sandstones]]) of Permo-Triassic age. Small amounts of carboniferous limestones, gritstones and coal measures reappear in the far south of Derbyshire from [[Ticknall]] (limestone) to [[Swadlincote]] (coal measures).<ref>[http://www.bgs.ac.uk/downloads/start.cfm?id=1615 "A Building Stone Atlas of Derbyshire & The Peak National Park"], ''English Heritage'', September 2011, retrieved 17 August 2015</ref>
Some areas of the White Peak exhibit contemporaneous basalt flows (e.g. Ravens Tor at Millers Dale), as well as subsequent dolerite sill intrusion at a much later stage (e.g.near Tideswell Dale),<ref>[http://peaklandheritage.org.uk/index.asp?peakkey=00103521 "Rocks and Fossils"], ''Peakland Heritage website'', retrieved 20 August 2015</ref> whilst mineralisation of the carboniferous limestone in a subsequent period created extensive lead and fluorite deposits which have formed a significant part of Derbyshire's economy, as did coal mining. Lead mining has been important here since Roman Times.<ref name="Geology">{{cite web |url=http://www.peakdistrictinformation.com/features/geology.php |title=The Peak District is a very interesting area geologically |work=Peak District Information |publisher=Cressbrook Multimedia |year=2008 |accessdate=17 August 2015}}</ref> The much more recent river gravels of the Trent valley remain a significant extractive industry today in south Derbyshire, as does the mining of limestone rock in central and northern parts of the county.<ref>[https://www.derbyshire.gov.uk/images/DD%20MLP%20Part%201_tcm44-189489.pdf "Derby and Derbyshire Minerals Local Plan"], ''Derbyshire County Council and Derby City Council'', Adopted April 2000 (revised 2002, currently under review in 2015), retrieved 17 August 2015</ref>
Coarse sandstones were once extensively quarried both for local building materials and for the production of gritstone grinding wheels for use in mills, and both former industries have left their mark on the Derbyshire landscape.

==Ecology==
Because of its central location in England, and its altitude range from 27 metres in the south to 636 metres in the north{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=1}}, Derbyshire contains many species at the edge of their UK distribution ranges. Some species with a predominantly northern British distribution are at the southern limit of their range, whilst others with a more southern distribution are at their northern limit in Derbyshire. As climate change progresses, a number of sensitive species are now being seen to be either expanding or contracting their range as a result{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=314}}.
For the purposes of protecting and recording the county's most important habitats, Derbyshire has been split into two regions, each with its own [[Biodiversity Action Plan]] (BAP), based around National Character Areas. The Peak District BAP includes all of Derbyshire's uplands of the Dark Peak, South-West Peak and White Peak, including area of limestone beyond the national park boundary.<ref>[http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/looking-after/biodiversity/biodiversity-action-plan "Peak District Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) 2011-2020"], ''Peak District National Pak website'', retrieved 18 August 2015</ref> The remaining areas are monitored and recorded in the Lowland Derbyshire Biodiversity Action Plan, which subdivides the landscape into eight smaller Action Areas.<ref>[http://www.derbyshirebiodiversity.org.uk/lbaps/lowland-derbyshire.php "Lowland Derbyshire Biodiversity Action Plan 2011-2020"], ''Lowland Derbyshire Biodiversity Partnership website'', retrieved 18 August 2015</ref>

The Derbyshire Biological Records Centre was formerly based at Derby Museum & Art Gallery, but since 2011 has been managed by Derbyshire Wildlife Trust.<ref>[http://www.derbyshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/what-we-do/derbyshire-biological-records-centre "Derbyshire Biological Records Centre"], ''Derbyshire Wildlife Trust website'', retrieved 18 August 2015</ref> Two of Englands 48 [[Local Nature Partnership]]s (LNP) also cover Derbyshire; these are the Peak District LNP and the Lowland Derbyshire & Nottinghamshire LNP.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/map-of-local-nature-partnerships "Map of Local Nature Partnerships"], ''Natural England/DEFRA website'', retrieved 18 August 2015</ref>

=== Botany ===
Since 2002 the county flower for Derbyshire has been [[Polemonium caeruleum|Jacob's-ladder]] (''Polemonium caeruleum''), a relatively rare species, and very characteristic of certain limestone dales in the White Peak.{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=187}}
Derbyshire is known to have contained 1,919 separate taxa of vascular plants (including species, hybrids and micro-species) since modern recording began,{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=409}} of which 1,133 are known to be either native or [[archaeophyte]], the remainder being non-native species. These comprise 336 established species, 433 casuals and 17 unassigned. It is known that 34 species of plants once native here have been lost from Derbyshire (i.e. become locally extinct) since modern plant recording began in the 17th century.{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=410}} Derbyshire contains two [[Endemism|endemic]] vascular plants, found nowhere else in the world: ''[[Rubus durescens]]'', occurring in central Derbyshire,{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=89}} and Derby hawkweed (''[[Hieracium naviense]]''), still known only from Winnats Pass.{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=263}}  One endemic species of moss, [[Thamnobryum angustifolium|Derbyshire Feather Moss]], occurs in one small 3-metre patch in just one Derbyshire limestone dale, its sole world location intentionally kept confidential.
The distribution and status of vascular plants in Derbyshire have been recorded over the last 120 years in a series of four major botanical works, each by different authors between 1889 and 2015, but all entitled The [[Flora of Derbyshire]]. Plant recording is mainly undertaken locally by volunteers from the Derbyshire Flora Group,{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=406}} and by staff at [[Derbyshire Wildlife Trust]] and the Peak District National Park.

[[File:Map of Derbyshire boundaries plus Peak District.jpg|thumb|Map of Derbyshire boundaries with Peak District also shown. Black = modern Geographic boundary, Red = Vice-county boundary (VC57) where this differs from modern; Dotted Blue = Peak District boundary]]

The Dark Peak is characterised by heathlands, bogs, gritstone edges and acid grasslands containing relatively few species, with plants such as [[Calluna|heather]] (''Calluna vulgaris''), [[Empetrum nigrum|crowberry]] (''Empetrum nigrum''), [[Vaccinium myrtillus|bilberry]] (''Vaccinium myrtillus'') and [[Eriophorum vaginatum|hare's-tail cotton grass]] (''Eriophorum vaginatum'') being dominant on the high moors.{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=6}} The dales of the White Peak are known for habitats such as [[calcareous grassland]], ash woodlands and rock outcrops in all of which a much greater richness of lime-loving species occurs than elsewhere in the county.{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=4}} These include various orchids (such as [[Orchis mascula|early purple orchid]] (''Orchis mascula''), [[Epipactis atrorubens|dark-red helleborine]] (''Epipactis atrorubens'') and [[Ophrys insectifera|fly orchid]] (''Ophrys insectifera'')), [[Helianthemum nummularium|common rockrose]] (''Helianthemum nummularium''), [[Helianthemum nummularium|spring cinquefoil]] (''Helianthemum nummularium'') and [[Parnassia|grass of parnassus]] (''Parnassia palustris''). Specialised communities of plants occur on former lead workings, where typical [[metallophyte]] species include [[Minuartia|spring sandwort]] (''Minuartia verna''), [[Thlaspi caerulescens|alpine penny-cress]] (''Thlaspi caerulescens'') (both known locally in Derbyshire as Leadwort), as well as [[Viola lutea|mountain pansy]] (''Viola lutea'') and [[Botrychium lunaria|moonwort]] (''Botrychium lunaria'').{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=6}}<ref name="Lead">{{cite web |url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/lead |title=Biodiversity Action Plan – The Lead Legacy |publisher=Peak District |year=2004 |accessdate=17 August 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720112405/http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/lead|archivedate=20 July 2011}}</ref>

As at 2015, Derbyshire contains 304 vascular plant species now designate as either of international, national or local conservation concern because of their rarity or recent declines, and are collectively listed as Derbyshire Red Data plants.{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=418}}
Work on recording and publishing a Bryophyte flora for Derbyshire is still ongoing; as at 2012 a total of 518 bryophyte species had been recorded for the county.<ref>Blockeel, Tom [http://www.derbyshirewildlifetrust.org.uk/wildlife/woodside-bioblitz/bryophytes "Bryophytes"], ''Derbyshire Wildlife Trust website'', July 2013, retrieved 17 August 2015</ref><ref>Blockeel, Tom [http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/bbs/Bryodiversity/vc57/vc57site.htm "A Bryological Tour through Derbyshire (v.-c.57)"], ''British Bryological Society website'', 18 January 2004, retrieved 17 August 2015</ref>

Botanical recording in the UK predominantly uses the unchanging [[vice-county]] boundary system, which results in a slightly different map of Derbyshire than the modern geographic county.{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=20}}

=== Zoology ===
A number of specialist organisations protect, promote and monitor records of individual animal groups across Derbyshire. The main ones are Derbyshire Ornithological Society; Derbyshire Mammal Group; Derbyshire Bat Group, Derbyshire Amphibian and Reptile Group, and the Derbyshire & Nottingham Entomological Society. All maintain databases of wildlife sightings, whilst some such as the Derbyshire Ornithological Society provide alerts of rare sightings on their websites or social media pages, and also publish major works describing the status and distribution of species.<ref>[http://www.derbyshireos.org.uk "Derbyshire Ornithological Society"], retrieved 18 August 2015</ref>

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2010}}
[[File:KinderDownfall6435.JPG|left|thumb|200px|The rugged moorland edge of the southern Pennines at Kinder Downfall]]
Derbyshire has a mixture of a rural economy in the west, with a former coal mining economy in the northeast (Bolsover district), the Erewash Valley around Ilkeston and in the south around Swadlincote.  The rural landscape varies from arable farmland in the flat lands to the south of Derby, to upland pasture and [[moorland]] in the high [[gritstone]] uplands of the southern Pennines.

Derbyshire is rich in natural mineral resources such as lead, iron, [[Pleasley Colliery|coal]], and limestone, which have been exploited over a long period—lead, for example, has been mined since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times. The limestone outcrops in the central area led to the establishment of large [[Quarry|quarries]] to supply the industries of the surrounding towns with [[Lime (material)|lime]] for building and [[steelmaking]], and latterly in the 20th century cement manufacture. The industrial revolution also increased demand for [[masonry|building stone]], and in the late 19th and early 20th century the railways' arrival led to a large number of stone quarries being established. This industry has left its mark on the countryside but is still a major industry: a lot of the stone is supplied as [[crushed stone]] for [[Road#Construction|road building]] and concrete manufacture, and is moved by rail.

[[File:Magpie mine.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The ruins of the [[Magpie Mine]] near [[Sheldon, Derbyshire|Sheldon]]]]
Derbyshire's relative remoteness in the late 18th century and an abundance of fast-flowing streams led to a proliferation of the use of [[hydropower]] at the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the mills pioneered by [[Richard Arkwright]]. Derbyshire has been said{{by whom|date=May 2014}} to be the home of the Industrial Revolution, and part of the [[Derwent Valley Mills|Derwent Valley]] has been given [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage status]] in acknowledgement of this historic importance.

Nationally famous companies in Derbyshire include [[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls Royce]], one of the world's leading aerospace companies, based since before World War I in Derby, [[Thorntons]] just south of Alfreton and [[Toyota Manufacturing UK|Toyota]], who have one of the UK's largest car manufacturing plants at [[Burnaston]]. Ashbourne Water used to be bottled in Buxton by [[Nestlé|Nestlé Waters UK]] until 2006 and Buxton Water still is.

The county is divided into eleven constituencies for the election of members of parliament (MPs) to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. As of May 2015, four constituencies are represented by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs, whilst the remaining seven are represented by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs.

Derbyshire has a three-tier local government since the [[Local Government Act 1972|local government reorganisation]] in 1974. It has a [[Derbyshire County Council|county council]] based in [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]] and eight [[Non-metropolitan district|district]] councils and since 1997, a [[unitary authority]] area of the City of Derby. Derby remains part of Derbyshire only for ceremonial purposes.

Derbyshire has become fractionally smaller during government reorganisation over the years. The Sheffield suburbs Woodseats, Beauchief, Handsworth, Woodhouse, Norton, [[Mosborough (ward)|Mosborough]], [[Totley]] and [[Dore]] were previously parts of the county, but were lost to [[Sheffield]] between 1900 and 1933, and Mosborough transferred in 1967. [[Marple Bridge]] was transferred to the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stockport]] in Greater Manchester.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, Derbyshire gained part of the [[Longdendale]] valley and [[Tintwistle]] from Cheshire in 1974. The current area of the geographic/ceremonial county of Derbyshire is only 4.7 square kilometres less than it was over 100 years ago.{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=1}}{{r|willmotmoyes|page1=20}}

At the third tier are the [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]], which do not cover all areas. The eight district councils in Derbyshire and the unitary authority of Derby are shown in the map above.

These district councils are responsible for [[planning permission|local planning]] and [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|building control]], local roads, [[council house|council housing]], [[environmental health]], markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.<ref name=lc>{{cite web |url=http://tellmeabout.thelocalchannel.co.uk/home.aspx?p=0&m=86 |work=The Local Channel|title=Glossary of Local Government Terms |accessdate=7 January 2008}}</ref> [[Local education authority|Education]], social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, [[Trading Standards]], waste disposal and strategic planning are the responsibility of the County Council.<ref name=lc/>

[[File:Turnditch. - geograph.org.uk - 177283.jpg|thumb|One of many Victorian village schools in Derbyshire]]
Although Derbyshire is in the [[East Midlands]], some parts, such as [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] (which incorporated former areas of [[Cheshire]] after boundary changes in 1974), are closer to the northern cities of [[Manchester]] and [[Sheffield]] and these parts do receive services which are more affiliated with northern England; for example, the [[North West Ambulance Service]], [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] and [[United Utilities]] serve the High Peak and some NHS Trusts within this region are governed by the Greater Manchester Health Authority. Outside the main city of Derby, the largest town in the county is [[Chesterfield]].
