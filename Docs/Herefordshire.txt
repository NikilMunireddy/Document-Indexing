'''Herefordshire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɛr|ɨ|f|ər|d|ʃ|ər}}; abbreviated '''Herefs.''' or '''Hfds.''') is an [[Historic counties of England|historic]] English [[Counties of England|county]] in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]]. It is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] and a unitary non-metropolitan county and district, also named in legislation as the '''County of Herefordshire''' and governed by [[Herefordshire Council]]. It borders the English ceremonial counties of [[Shropshire]] to the north, [[Worcestershire]] to the east, [[Gloucestershire]] to the south-east, and the [[Wales|Welsh]] [[Preserved counties of Wales|preserved counties]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]] to the south-west and [[Powys]] to the west. The [[Local government in Wales|Welsh unitary county]] covering the part of Gwent next to Herefordshire is [[Monmouthshire]].

[[Hereford]] is a [[cathedral city]] and is the [[county town]]; with a population of approximately 55,800 inhabitants it is also the largest settlement. The county is one of the most rural and sparsely populated in England, with a [[population density]] of 82/km² (212/sq mi). The land use is predominantly agricultural and the county is well known for its fruit and [[cider]] production, and the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford cattle]] breed.

==Constitution==
From 1974 to 1998, Herefordshire was part of the former [[non-metropolitan county]] of [[Hereford and Worcester]].

Herefordshire was reconstituted both as a new [[non-metropolitan district|district]] (effective 19 July 1996) and as a new [[non-metropolitan county|county]] (coextensive with the area of the aforementioned district) (effective 1 April 1998) by [[Statutory Instrument]] as defined in ''The Hereford and Worcester (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1996/Uksi_19961867_en_2.htm |title='&#39;The Hereford and Worcester (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996'&#39; |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=16 July 2010 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> This Order established Herefordshire as a [[unitary authority]] on 1 April 1998, combining county and district functions into a single council. Herefordshire is also commonly called a ''unitary district'', but this is not official nomenclature. Herefordshire is officially known as a unitary authority for local government purposes.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]] made Herefordshire a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]], covering the exact area of the unitary district. For [[Eurostat]] purposes it is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG11) and is one of three counties that comprise the "Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire" [[NUTS 2 statistical regions of the United Kingdom|NUTS 2 region]].<ref>{{cite web | title = NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics), by regional level, version 2013 | publisher = [[Eurostat]] | url = http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/ramon/documents/nuts/NUTS_2013.zip | format = zip | accessdate = 11 January 2015}}</ref>

There are two [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] in the county. The [[Wye Valley]] is located in the river's valleys south of Hereford, while the [[Malvern Hills]] are in the east of the county, along its border with [[Worcestershire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aonb.org.uk/wba/naaonb/naaonbpreview.nsf/Web%20Default%20Frameset?OpenFrameSet&Frame=Main&Src=%2Fwba%2Fnaaonb%2Fnaaonbpreview.nsf%2F%24LU.WebHomePage%2F%24first!OpenDocument%26AutoFramed |title=NAAONB Website |publisher=Aonb.org.uk |date= |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Herefordshire}}

Herefordshire is one of the 39 [[Ancient counties of England|historic counties of England]].

In 1974 it was merged with neighbouring [[Worcestershire]] to form the Hereford and Worcester [[non-metropolitan county|administrative county]]. Within this, Herefordshire was covered by the [[Non-metropolitan district|local government districts]] of [[South Herefordshire]], [[Hereford]], and part of [[Malvern Hills (district)|Malvern Hills]] and [[Leominster (district)|Leominster]] districts. However, the county was dissolved in 1998, resulting in the return of Herefordshire and Worcestershire as counties.<ref>{{UK SI   | year = 1996   | number = 1867   | section =    | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1867/contents/made   | title = The Hereford and Worcester (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996   | isbn =    | made = 18 July 1996 | laid =   | force = 1 April 1998 }} </ref>

The current [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] and [[unitary authority|unitary district]] have broadly the same borders as the pre-1974 historic county.

==Demographics==

===Population growth===
Herefordshire's growth rate has in recent decades been higher than the national average, with the population increasing by  
14.4% between 1991 and 2011 - the population of England as a whole increased by only 10.0%. However this has been from a lower base, with only Northumberland and Cumbria having lower population densities than Herefordshire.

===Council===
{{main|Herefordshire Council}}
The Council operates a [[cabinet-style council]] and is Conservative controlled. The Chairman is Councillor Brian Wilcox, the Cabinet Leader for Herefordshire is Councillor Tony Johnson.

The Cabinet Leader is appointed yearly by the full council of 53 councillors. The Cabinet Leader then picks their deputy and up to 8 other councillors to form the executive cabinet.  Each cabinet member makes the decisions about the portfolio that they are allocated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/government-citizens-and-rights/democracy/council-committees/what-is-the-cabinet-and-who-are-the-cabinet-members |publisher=Herefordshire  Council | title= What is the cabinet and who are the cabinet members? | accessdate=2016-02-28 | quote = cabinet consists of six members, including the leader of the council and the deputy leader, each responsible for a programme area }}</ref>  Elections to the council are held every 4 years. Elections are conducted under the [[First Past the Post|FPTP]] system with all 53 wards returning 1 councillor . Elections have been held in [[Herefordshire Council Election, 2000|2000]], 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015 with the next election due in 2019.

The Herefordshire Youth Council has been running for 4 years; it is chaired by Amy Saunders.

==Education==
{{Seealso|List of schools in Herefordshire}}
Herefordshire has a comprehensive education system that also includes several independent schools.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/schooltables/herefordshire-1380158.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=15 January 2009 | title=Herefordshire}}</ref> Most state secondary schools are for ages 11–16. Colleges of further and higher education in the county include [[Hereford College of Arts]], [[Hereford College of Education]], [[Hereford Sixth Form College]], [[Herefordshire and Ludlow College]] and the [[Royal National College for the Blind]].

==Agriculture==
The agricultural economy has changed massively in recent years within the county. The county is on the western edge of England which has been historically pastoral as opposed to the east which was more [[arable land|arable]].  {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Beef===
[[File:Hereford bull large.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hereford cattle]], such as this bull, originated in the county and are now bred throughout the world.]] 
Probably Hereford's most famous export is its [[Hereford cattle|Hereford beef cattle]]. Herefords are docile but extremely hardy creatures and these attributes have led to their proliferation across the world, particularly the USA, South America and Australia. The breed is so gentle that a Hereford bull has been used as the mascot for [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United Football Club]] for many years, led around the club's [[Edgar Street]] ground before major matches.

===Fruit===
The county is famous for its apple and pear orchards, and its cider. There are many orchards around the county but not as many as there once were.

In the last few years, soft [[fruit]]s such as [[strawberries]] have become a new and rapidly expanding area of the agricultural economy of the county. One of the main reasons for this was the introduction of the [[polytunnel]] or French tunnel. This allows the strawberries to be grown for a far longer season and with a higher quality (with no blemishes from the rain). The strawberries are mainly picked by [[Eastern European]] workers who come over for the season and often earn more money, more than they could working in their own country and with the bonus, for many of them, of learning or improving their English. The polytunnels have been a major issue in the county, as some people see them as a "blot on the landscape".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polytunnelcontrol.org.uk/press.htm |title=CPC&nbsp;— Press |publisher=Polytunnelcontrol.org.uk |date= |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref>

Although some polytunnel sites are illegal, [[Herefordshire Council]] has turned a blind eye in the belief that agriculture must be allowed to innovate; otherwise it will stagnate and the county will suffer.<ref>{{cite web  | title = THE QUEEN ON THE APPLICATION OF WYE VALLEY ACTION ASSOCIATION LIMITED v HEREFORDSHIRE COUNCIL and EC DRUMMOND & SON  | work = [2009] EWHC 3428 (Admin), [2010] Env LR 18, [2010] 2 All ER 863   | publisher = [[BAILII#BAILII]]  | date = 18 December 2009  | url = http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/3428.html  | accessdate = 24 August 2010  | quote = the Council, in my judgment, have made an error of law in relation to their findings that this development was not a project within Schedule 2 and such an error of law, as I set out above, means that quashing of the decision must follow, because the Council have failed to undertake an environmental impact assessment of the process. They failed to go on to consider whether or not the project would have significant environmental effects and, therefore, whether or not it required an environmental statement. In those circumstances, there is no need or purpose for me to consider the subsidiary ground which was raised in relation to the reasons provided with the screening opinion since my conclusions in respect of the first element of the ground of challenge disposes of the case and the planning consent must be quashed. }}</ref>

===Dairy===
Previously, most farms in the county had [[dairy cattle]]. Due to the cost of investing in new equipment, long hours{{clarify|date=September 2013}}, [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]], [[foot-and-mouth disease]] and mainly falling milk prices, the county's milk production has drastically reduced, with only a few farms still in dairy farming.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Potatoes===
As mentioned above, the county is historically pastoral. The soils are mostly clay, meaning that large scale potato production was very difficult, as tractors were not powerful enough to pull the large machinery required to harvest the crop. Around the early 1990s new technology and more powerful machines overcame this problem. Potato production started to increase, fuelled by a few other key factors: The previously pastoral soils had not had potatoes grown in them; consequently they were not infected with [[nematode|eelworm]] (''Heterodera rostochiensis'' and ''Heterodera pallida''), which in the east of England had to be sprayed against weekly (a large cost). Also, the clay soil produced an unblemished potato of the highest grade. The intensive nature of the crop meant that potatoes could be grown viably on a given field in only one of every five years. Because potato growers always needed more land than they owned, they rented extra. This demand for rental fields came at a time when the rest of the industry was struggling and in serious decline. The potato farmers' rents of £300-500 per acre (as opposed to normally £80 per acre) were very helpful to many farmers in a difficult period. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Emblems==

===Coat of arms===
Herefordshire County Council was granted a [[coat of arms]] on 28 February 1946.<ref name="briggs">Geoffrey Briggs, ''Civic and Corporate Heraldry'', London, 1971</ref> The arms became obsolete in 1974 on the abolition of the council, but were transferred to the present Herefordshire Council by [[Order in Council]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1997/19972618.htm |title='&#39;The Local Authorities (Armorial Bearings) (No. 2) Order 1997'&#39;, www.opsi.gov.uk, accessed October 31, 2007 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=1 April 1974 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref>

The arms are [[blazon]]ed as follows:

''[[Gules]] on a [[fess]]e wavy between in chief a lion passant guardant [[argent]] and in base a Herefordshire bull's head caboshed proper, a bar wavy [[azure (heraldry)|azure]]; and for a [[crest (heraldry)|Crest]] on a wreath of the colours a demi lion rampant gules holding in the sinister claw a fleece or; and for Supporters, on the dexter side a lion guardant or gorged with a wreath of hops fructed proper and on the sinister a talbot argent gorged with a collar or charged with three apples proper.''<ref name="briggs"/>

The red colouring ("gules") of the shield is taken from the arms of the City of Hereford. The red colour also represents the red earth of Herefordshire. The silver and blue wave across the centre of the shield represents the River Wye. The lions that form parts of the arms, crest and supporters are also taken from Hereford's arms. The agricultural produce of Herefordshire is represented by the bull's head, fleece, hops and apples. The [[Talbot (dog)|talbot dog]] comes from the heraldry of the Talbot family, Marcher Lords of Shrewsbury and also from that of Viscount Hereford.

The [[Latin]] [[motto]] is: ''Pulchra terra Dei donum'' ("This fair land is the gift of God").<ref>C Wilfrid Scott-Giles, ''Civic Heraldry of England and Wales'', 2nd edition, London, 1953</ref>

===County flower===
As part of a competition organised by the charity [[Plantlife]] to raise awareness of conservation issues, the public were asked to vote for "[[county flower]]s" that they felt best represented their county. [[Mistletoe]] was announced as the winning choice for Herefordshire in 2004.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kirby |first=Alex |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3684291.stm |title='&#39;UK counties choose floral emblems'&#39;, BBC News online, accessed October 31, 2007 |publisher=BBC News |date=5 May 2004 |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> The emblem has no official status, and has not been widely adopted.

Cricket is widely played within the county, and [[Herefordshire County Cricket Club]] compete in the [[Minor Counties Championship]], having been elected in 1992 to take Durham's place, when that county joined the First-class structure.  The leading club sides in Herefordshire are Brockhampton CC and Eastnor CC, who both compete in the [[Birmingham and District Premier League]], the ECB accredited Premier League for cricket clubs in the West Midlands, and one of the strongest cricket leagues in England.  Below that in the cricketing pyramid system 7 other leading Herefordshire clubs compete in the [[Worcestershire County Cricket League]], with the remaining 25 or so cricket clubs within the county competing in the Marches League, or just playing Sunday or mid-week 'friendly' matches.

==Transport==

===Road===
[[File:M50 motorway from Ryton Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The M50 motorway near [[Ledbury]] and [[Ross-on-Wye]].]]
The [[M50 motorway (Great Britain)|M50]], one of the first [[motorways]] to be built in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], runs through the south of the county and, with the [[A40 road|A40]] [[dual carriageway]], forms part of the major route linking [[South Wales]] with Gloucester, Oxford and London.  The [[A49 road|A49]] runs north–south through the county and is a strategic route between [[North Wales|North]] and South Wales as well as catering for local traffic.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/365282Midlands_to_Wales_and_Gloucestershire.pdf | title = Midlands to Wales and Gloucestershire route-based strategy evidence report | date = April 2014 | website = Department for Transport | publisher = [[Highways Agency]] | access-date = 2016-03-25 | quote = The A49 is also used as a strategic route between North and South Wales. }}</ref>

===Railways===
The [[Welsh Marches Line|Welsh Marches Railway Line]] also runs north–south with passenger trains operated by [[Arriva Trains Wales]] offering links to [[Manchester]] as well as to North and South Wales.  Hereford is the western end of the [[Cotswold Line]] which runs via [[Worcester]] with through services to [[Oxford]] and [[London Paddington]] (operated by [[First Great Western]]) and to [[Birmingham]] (operated by [[London Midland]]).  The rural [[Heart of Wales Line]] linking [[Craven Arms]] in Shropshire to [[Llanelli]] in southwest Wales passes through the extreme north west of Herefordshire with stations at [[Knighton railway station|Knighton]] and [[Bucknell railway station|Bucknell]] near the meeting point of the boundaries of Herefordshire, [[Shropshire]] and [[Powys]].<ref>{{Citation  | title = Presteigne and Hay-on-Wye: Llanandras A'r Gelli Gandryll (Landranger Maps)  | publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]]  | year = 2007  | edition = B2 | isbn = 978-0319229484 }}</ref>  The majority of passengers between North and South Wales use the Marches line.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blaenau-gwent.gov.uk/documents/wales%20docs/W29.pdf | title = National Transport Plan  | date = 2009 | publisher = [[Welsh Assembly Government]] | access-date = 2016-03-25 | quote = Rail caters for longer distance travel with the services using the Marches Line, which in part runs through England, taking the majority of passengers. }}</ref>

Former lines which are now closed were [[Ledbury]] to [[Gloucester]]; [[Hereford]] to [[Ross-on-Wye]] and onward to [[Gloucester]] and [[Monmouth]]; Hereford to [[Hay-on-Wye]]; [[Pontrilas]] to Hay-on-Wye; Hay-on-Wye to [[Brecon]]; [[Leominster]] to [[New Radnor]]; [[Eardisley]] to [[Presteigne]]; and [[Leominster]] to [[Worcester]] via [[Bromyard]]. Part of the Titley Spur is opened annually by enthusiasts and a steam train is run along the track.

There has long been talk of a new station at Rotherwas, in the south of [[Hereford]].

===Air===
There are no [[airports]] with [[Scheduled air transport|scheduled]] air services in Herefordshire. [[Birmingham International Airport (UK)|Birmingham]], [[Cardiff International Airport|Cardiff]] both have railway stations and [[Bristol Airport|Bristol]] (which involves bus travel from [[Bristol Temple Meads]] as well as a change of train in [[Newport railway station|Newport]]) international airports are the nearest. The RailAir<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railair.com |title=Welcome to |publisher=Railair.com |date= |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> [[Coach (rail)|coach]] operated by First Great Western provides connections to [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] via [[Reading railway station|Reading station]] or passengers can change at [[Reading railway station|Reading station]] and then go all the way by train via [[Hayes and Harlington railway station|Hayes & Harlington]] to [[Heathrow Airport]].  
[[Shobdon Aerodrome]] near Leominster is a centre for [[general aviation]] and [[gliding]]. [[Hot air balloon]]ing is also popular with [[Eastnor Castle]] being one of the favourite launch sites in the area.

===Waterways===
Historically, the rivers [[River Wye|Wye]], [[River Teme|Teme]] and [[River Lugg|Lugg]] were [[navigable]] but the wide seasonal variations in water levels mean that few craft larger than [[canoes]] and [[coracles]] are now used. There are canoe centres at [http://www.wyevalleycanoes.co.uk The Boat House], Glasbury-on-Wye (in [[Powys]], Wales), [http://www.herefordshire.gov.uk/youthservice/22702.asp the Hereford Youth Service] and [http://www.wye-pursuits.co.uk Kerne Bridge] in [[Ross-on-Wye]], as well as [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] clubs in Hereford and Ross-on-Wye.

The early 19th century saw the construction of two [[canals]], The [[Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/post-medieval/canals/hereford_gloucester.htm |title=Hereford & Gloucester Canal |publisher=Smr.herefordshire.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> and The Leominster & Stourport Canal<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smr.herefordshire.gov.uk/post-medieval/canals/leominster_stourport.htm |title=Leominster & Stourport Canal |publisher=Smr.herefordshire.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref> but these were never successful and there are now few remains to be seen. The [[Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal]] is currently the subject a restoration project, which includes the construction of a new canal basin in [[Hereford]] city centre as part of the regeneration of the [[Edgar Street Grid]]. The project, however, is being undertaken by a small voluntary group and there is no expected date for any part of the canal to re-open for boating.
