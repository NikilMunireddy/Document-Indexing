The Arctic consists of the [[Arctic Ocean]] and parts of [[Alaska]] ([[United States]]), [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Greenland]] ([[Denmark]]), [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Russia]], and [[Sweden]]. The Arctic region consists of an ocean and adjacent seas with a seasonally varying [[sea ice|ice cover]], surrounded by treeless [[permafrost]]. The area can be defined as north of the [[Arctic Circle]] (66° 33'N), the approximate limit of the [[midnight sun]] and the [[polar night]]. Alternatively, it can be defined as the region where the average temperature for the warmest month (July) is below {{convert|10|°C}}; the northernmost [[tree line]] roughly follows the [[Isotherm (contour line)|isotherm]] at the boundary of this region.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/arctic "arctic."] ''Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).''

Socially and politically, the Arctic region includes the northern territories of the eight Arctic states, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States, although by [[natural science]] definitions, much of this territory is considered [[subarctic]]. The Arctic region is a unique area among Earth's ecosystems. For example, the cultures in the region and the Arctic [[indigenous peoples]] have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions. In recent years, the extent of the sea ice has declined.<ref name="Serreze, Mc; Holland, Mm; Stroeve, J 2007 1533–6"/><ref name="link5">[http://nsidc.org/sotc/sea_ice.html "Global Sea Ice Extent and Concentration: What sensors on satellites are telling us about sea ice."] National Snow and Ice Data Center.

Perseus Digital Library.</ref> and that from the word ἄρκτος (''arktos''), meaning [[bear]].<ref>Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott.

== Climate ==
{{Main|Climate of the Arctic}}
The Arctic's climate is characterized by cold winters and cool summers. Precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow. The Arctic's annual precipitation is low, with most of the area receiving less than {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can be as low as {{convert|-40|C|0}}, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately {{convert|-68|C|0}}. Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas. The Arctic is affected by current [[global warming]], leading to [[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic sea ice shrinkage]] and [[Arctic methane release]].

Due to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about {{Convert|35|mi|abbr=on}} per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming), the Arctic region (as defined by tree line and temperature) is currently shrinking.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i | last=Hansen | first=Jim | title=The Planet in Peril – Part I | publisher=Yale Center for the Study of Globalization | date=19 October 2006}}</ref> Perhaps the most spectacular result of Arctic shrinkage is sea ice loss. There is a large variance in predictions of Arctic sea ice loss, with models showing near-complete to complete loss in September from 2040 to some time well beyond 2100. About half of the analyzed models show near-complete to complete sea ice loss in September by the year 2100.<ref name="Serreze, Mc; Holland, Mm; Stroeve, J 2007 1533–6">{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1139426|date=Mar 2007|author1=Serreze, Mc |author2=Holland, Mm |author3=Stroeve, J |title=Perspectives on the Arctic's shrinking sea-ice cover|volume=315|issue=5818|pages=1533–6|pmid=17363664|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|bibcode = 2007Sci...315.1533S }}</ref>

== Flora and fauna ==

=== Plants ===
[[Arctic vegetation]] is composed of plants such as [[Subshrub|dwarf shrubs]], [[Grass|graminoids]], [[herb]]s, [[lichen]]s and [[moss]]es which all grow relatively close to the ground, forming [[tundra]]. As one moves northward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably. In the northernmost areas, plants are at their metabolic limits, and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth and reproduction. Colder summer temperatures cause the size, abundance, productivity and variety of plants to decrease. Trees cannot grow in the Arctic, but in its warmest parts, shrubs are common and can reach {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height; [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], mosses and lichens can form thick layers. In the coldest parts of the Arctic, much of the ground is bare; [[non-vascular plant]]s such as lichens and mosses predominate, along with a few scattered grasses and [[forb]]s (like the [[Papaver radicatum|Arctic poppy]]).

=== Animals ===
[[File:Muskus.jpg|thumb|[[Muskox]]]]
Herbivores on the tundra include the [[Arctic hare]], [[lemming]], [[muskox]], and [[reindeer|caribou]]. They are preyed on by the [[snowy owl]], [[Arctic fox]] and [[Arctic wolf|wolf]]. The [[polar bear]] is also a predator, though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice. There are also many [[bird]]s and marine species endemic to the colder regions. Other land animals include [[wolverines]], [[Stoat|ermines]], and [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s. Marine mammals include [[Pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]], and several species of [[cetacea]]n—[[baleen whale]]s and also [[narwhal]]s, [[killer whale]]s and [[Beluga whale|belugas]]. An excellent and famous example of a [[ring species]] exists and has been described around the arctic circle in the form of the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls.

== Natural resources ==
{{See also|Natural resources of the Arctic|Petroleum exploration in the Arctic}}

The Arctic includes sizable [[natural resource]]s (oil, gas, minerals, fresh water, fish and if the subarctic is included, forest) to which modern technology and the economic opening up of Russia have given significant new opportunities. The interest of the tourism industry is also on the increase.

The Arctic is one of the last and most extensive continuous [[wilderness]] areas in the world, and its significance in preserving [[biodiversity]] and [[genotype]]s is considerable. The increasing presence of humans fragments vital habitats. The Arctic is particularly susceptible to the abrasion of [[groundcover]] and to the disturbance of the rare breeding grounds of the animals that are characteristic to the region. The Arctic also holds 1/5 of the Earth's water supply.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

== Palaeontology==
[[File:Arctic fossils.jpg|Marine [[fossils]] in [[Canadian Arctic]]|thumb]]
During the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous time period]], the Arctic still had seasonal snows, though only a light dusting and not enough to permanently hinder plant growth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Animals such as the ''[[Chasmosaurus]]'', ''[[Hypacrosaurus]]'', ''[[Troodon]]'', and ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' may have all migrated north to take advantage of the summer growing season, and migrated south to warmer climes when the winter came. A similar situation may also have been found amongst [[dinosaur]]s that lived in [[Antarctic]] regions, such as the ''[[Muttaburrasaurus]]'' of [[Australia]].

However, others claim that dinosaurs lived year-round at very high latitudes, such as near the [[Colville River (Alaska)|Colville River]], which is now at about 70°&nbsp;N but at the time (70 million years ago) was 10° further north.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A palaeontologist’s Alaskan adventure|journal=[[New Scientist]]|date=Jun 9, 2012|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428686-800}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author1=[[Roland Gangloff]]|title=Dinosaurs under the Aurora|date=2012|asin=B008HNM988}}</ref>

{{Main|Circumpolar peoples}}
{{Further|Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Inuit Circumpolar Council}}
The earliest inhabitants of North America's central and eastern Arctic are referred to as the [[Arctic small tool tradition]] (AST) and existed c. 2500 BC. AST consisted of several [[Paleo-Eskimo]] cultures, including the [[Independence I culture|Independence cultures]] and [[Pre-Dorset]] culture.<ref name="Hoffecker">{{cite book|last=Hoffecker|first=John F. |title=A prehistory of the north: human settlement of the higher latitudes|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005 |page=130|isbn=0-8135-3469-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_rL5F4EAaFkC&pg=PA132}}</ref><ref name="Gibbon">Gibbon, pp. 28–31</ref> The [[Dorset culture]] ([[Inuktitut]]: ''Tuniit'' or ''Tunit'') refers to the next inhabitants of central and eastern Arctic. The Dorset culture evolved because of technological and economic changes during the period of 1050–550 BC. With the exception of the [[Quebec]]/[[Labrador]] peninsula, the Dorset culture vanished around 1500 AD.<ref>Gibbon, pp. 216–217</ref> Supported by genetic testing, evidence shows that descendants of the Dorset culture, known as the [[Sadlermiut]], survived in Aivilik, [[Southampton Island|Southampton]] and [[Coats Island]]s, until the beginning of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=McGhee|first=Robert |title=The last imaginary place: a human history of the Arctic world |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|edition=Digitized 7 October 2008|page=55|isbn=0-19-518368-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NdaAAAAAMAAJ&q=sagdlermiut+genetic&dq=sagdlermiut+genetic&cd=1}}</ref>

The Dorset/[[Thule people|Thule culture]] transition dates around the 9th–10th centuries. Scientists theorize that there may have been cross-contact of the two cultures with sharing of technology, such as fashioning harpoon heads, or the Thule may have found Dorset remnants and adapted their ways with the predecessor culture.<ref>Gibbon, p. 218</ref> Others believe the Thule displaced the Dorset. By 1300, the [[Inuit]], present-day Arctic inhabitants and descendants of Thule culture, had settled in west Greenland, and moved into east Greenland over the following century. Over time, the Inuit have migrated throughout the Arctic regions of Canada, Greenland, Russia and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/ethno/etb0170e.shtml |title=First Nations Culture Areas Index |work=the Canadian Museum of Civilization }}</ref>

Other Circumpolar North indigenous peoples include the [[Buryat people|Buryat]], [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]], [[Evenks]], [[Inupiat people|Inupiat]], [[Khanty people|Khanty]], [[Koryaks]], [[Nenets people|Nenets]], [[Sami people|Sami]], [[Yukaghir people|Yukaghir]], and [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]]. The Yupik still refer to themselves as [[Eskimo]], which means "snowshoe netters", not "raw meat eaters" as it is sometimes mistakenly translated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/cultures/the_americas/arctic_peoples.aspx |title=Arctic Peoples |work=British Museum }}</ref>

The eight Arctic nations (Canada, Denmark (Greenland & The Faroe Islands), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and USA) are all members of the [[Arctic Council]], as are organizations representing six indigenous populations. The Council operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes.

Though Arctic policy priorities differ, every Arctic nation is concerned about sovereignty/defense, resource development, shipping routes, and environmental protection.<ref name="Buixade Farre 2014">{{cite journal  |first1=Albert |last1=Buixadé Farré |first2= Scott R. |last2= Stephenson|first3= Linling|last3=Chen|first4=Michael |last4=Czub |first5= Ying|last5=Dai |first6=Denis |last6=Demchev |first7= Yaroslav |last7=Efimov |first8=Piotr |last8=Graczyk |first9=Henrik |last9=Grythe |first10=Kathrin |last10=Keil |first11= Niku|last11=Kivekäs|first12=Naresh |last12=Kumar |first13=Nengye |last13=Liu |first14=Igor |last14=Matelenok |first15= Mari|last15=Myksvoll |first16=Derek |last16= O'Leary |first17=Julia |last17=Olsen |first18= Sachin|last18=Pavithran .A.P. |first19=Edward |last19=Petersen |first20=Andreas |last20=Raspotnik |first21=Ivan |last21=Ryzhov |first22=Jan |last22=Solski|first23= Lingling|last23=Suo|first24=Caroline |last24=Troein|first25=Vilena |last25=Valeeva|first26=Jaap |last26=van Rijckevorsel |first27=Jonathan |last27=Wighting   |date= 16 October 2014 |title=Commercial Arctic shipping through the Northeast Passage: Routes, resources, governance, technology, and infrastructure |journal=[[Polar Geography]] |publisher= [[Taylor & Francis]] |doi= 10.1080/1088937X.2014.965769 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1088937X.2014.965769 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151205092242/http://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/item/escidoc:676888:6/component/escidoc:826920/676888.pdf |archivedate=December 5, 2015 |deadurl=no }}</ref> Much work remains on regulatory agreements regarding shipping, tourism, and resource development in Arctic waters.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Berkman|first1=Paul|title=Stability and Peace in the Arctic Ocean through Science Diplomacy|journal=Science & Diplomacy|date=23 June 2014|volume=3|issue=2|url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2014/stability-and-peace-in-arctic-ocean-through-science-diplomacy}}</ref>

Research in the Arctic has long been a collaborative international effort, evidenced perhaps most notably by the [[International Polar Year]].  The [[International Arctic Science Committee]], hundreds of scientists and specialists of the [[Arctic Council]], and the Barents Euro-Arctic Council are more examples of collaborative international Arctic research.

=== Territorial claims ===
{{Main|Territorial claims in the Arctic}}
No country owns the geographic [[North Pole]] or the region of the Arctic Ocean surrounding it. The surrounding six Arctic states that border the Arctic Ocean—Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and the United States—are limited to a {{Convert|200|NM|lk=in}} exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off their coasts. Two Arctic states (Finland and Sweden) do not have direct access to the Arctic Ocean.

=== Exploration ===
{{Main|Arctic exploration}}
{{See also|Petroleum exploration in the Arctic}}
Since 1937, the larger portion of the Asian-side Arctic region has been extensively explored by [[Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations]]. Between 1937 and 1991, 88 international polar crews established and occupied scientific settlements on the [[drift ice]] and were carried thousands of kilometers by the ice flow.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html | title=North Pole drifting stations (1930s–1980s) | publisher=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution | accessdate=30 April 2009}}</ref>

=== Pollution ===
[[File:contamination pathways large.jpg|thumb|Long-range pollution pathways to the Arctic]]
The Arctic is comparatively clean, although there are certain ecologically difficult localized [[pollution]] problems that present a serious threat to people's health living around these pollution sources. Due to the prevailing worldwide sea and air currents, the Arctic area is the fallout region for long-range transport [[pollutant]]s, and in some places the concentrations exceed the levels of densely populated urban areas. An example of this is the phenomenon of [[Arctic haze]], which is commonly blamed on long-range pollutants. Another example is with the [[bioaccumulation]] of PCB's ([[polychlorinated biphenyl]]s) in Arctic wildlife and people.

=== Preservation ===
{{Main|Save the Arctic}}
There have been many proposals to preserve the Arctic over the years. Most recently a group of stars at the Rio Earth Summit, on 21 June 2012, proposed protecting the Arctic, similar to the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic]] protection. The initial focus of the campaign will be a UN resolution creating a global sanctuary around the pole, and a ban on oil drilling and unsustainable fishing in the Arctic.<ref>[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/press/releases/Stars-launch-campaign-to-save-the-Arctic/ Stars launch campaign to save the Arctic].

As can be seen in the two plot at the right, since about 1995 to 2000, all three size numbers of the Arctic sea ice shield (extent, area and volume) are decreasing in an accelerated way. This downward movement is modulated by statistical variations, which lead to considerable media attention, when a new record has been reached.

Concerning melting records, 2012 was a productive year, thus corroborating the tendency of the past decade. This may have been furthered by a strong summer storm cyclone, a rare event in the Arctic, which spread the already very thin ice and caused mixing of the cold surface waters with deeper warmer water layers.
According to the [[University of Bremen]], in September 2011 the Arctic ice cap was smaller than ever recorded (the satellite measurements started in the 1970s).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2011/091311.html | title=Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis | date=13 September 2011 | publisher=NSIDC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/14/us-arctic-ice-idUSTRE78D02E20110914 | title=Report: Arctic sea ice coverage second lowest on record | date=13 September 2011 | agency=Reuters}}</ref> Arctic ice is declining in area and thinning. Arctic temperatures have risen more than twice as fast as the global average over the past half century. The speed of change has shocked scientists. If current trends continue, a largely ice-free Arctic in the summer is likely within 30 years – up to 40 years earlier than was anticipated by the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]].<ref>{{cite web

As the volume of sea ice until recently could not be measured by remote sensing as easy as its extent, numerical models have been made to estimate the ice thickness field between known points, which then is summed up to yield ice volume. The resulting volume over time reveals a much stronger loss of ice than ice extent studies suggest.<ref name="zhangrothrock1" />

The current Arctic shrinkage is leading to fears of Arctic methane release.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lenton | first1 = T.

On millennial time-scales, decomposition of [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|methane hydrates]] in the Arctic seabed could also amplify global warming.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Previous methane release events have been linked to the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|great dying]], a mass [[extinction event]] at the boundary of the [[Permian]] and [[Triassic]], and the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], in which temperatures abruptly increased.

Apart from concerns regarding the detrimental effects of warming in the Arctic, some potential opportunities have gained attention. The melting of the ice is making the [[Northwest Passage]], the shipping routes through the northernmost latitudes, more navigable, raising the possibility that the Arctic region will become a prime [[trade route]].<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/08/29/northwest.passage/ "Will ice melt open fabled Northwest Passage?"] CNN. 29 August 2002.</ref> In addition, it is believed that the Arctic seabed may contain substantial [[oil field]]s which may become accessible if the ice covering them melts.<ref>Demos, Telis.
