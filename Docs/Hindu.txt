'''Hindu''' ({{Audio|hi-Hindu.ogg|pronunciation}}) are the adherents of [[Hinduism]] most notably in [[Nepal]] and [[India]] and their diaspora. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural or religious identifier for people indigenous to the [[South Asia]].<ref name=brian111/><ref>http://www.freedictionary.com/Hinduism</ref> In contemporary use, Hindu refers to anyone who regards himself or herself as culturally, ethnically or religiously adhering to aspects of [[Hinduism]].<ref name=jefferylong>[[Jeffery D. Long]] (2007), A Vision for Hinduism, IB Tauris, ISBN 978-1845112738, pages 35-37</ref>

The historical meaning of the term ''Hindu'' has evolved with time. Starting with the Persian and Greek references to India in the 1st millennium BCE through the texts of the medieval era,{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}} the term Hindu implied a geographic, ethnic or cultural identifier for people living in Indian subcontinent around or beyond Sindhu ([[Indus]]) river.<ref name=hawleynarayanan>John Stratton Hawley and Vasudha Narayanan (2006), The Life of Hinduism, University of California Press, ISBN 978-0520249141, pages 10-11</ref> By the 16th-century, the term began to refer to residents of India who were not Turks or Muslims.<ref name=hawleynarayanan/>{{Efn|{{harvtxt|Flood|1996|p=6}} adds: "(...) 'Hindu', or 'Hindoo', was used towards the end of the eighteenth century by the British to refer to the people of 'Hindustan', the people of northwest India. Eventually 'Hindu' became virtually equivalent to an 'Indian' who was not a Muslim, Sikh, Jain or Christian, thereby encompassing a range of religious beliefs and practices. The '-ism' was added to Hindu in around 1830 to denote the culture and religion of the high-caste Brahmans in contrast to other religions, and the term was soon appropriated by Indians themselves in the context of building a national identity opposed to colonialism, though the term 'Hindu' was used in Sanskrit and Bengali hagiographic texts in contrast to 'Yavana' or Muslim as early as the sixteenth century".}}{{Efn|{{harvtxt|von Stietencron|2005|p=229}}: For more than 100 years the word Hindu (plural) continued to denote the Indians in general. But when, from AD 712 onwards, Muslims began to settle permanently in the Indus valley and to make converts among low-caste Hindus, Persian authors distinguished between Hindus and Muslims in India: Hindus were Indians other than Muslim. We know that Persian scholars were able to distinguish a number of religions among the Hindus. But when Europeans started to use the term Hindoo, they applied it to the non-Muslim masses of India without those scholarly differentiations.}}

<!-- Omitted for now
Despite the commonplace use of the term "Hindu" for the followers of the Hindu religion, the term also continues to designate a cultural identity, the ownership of India's millenia-old cultural heritage. [[Arvind Sharma]] notes that the exclusivist conception of religion was foreign to India, and Indians did not yield to it during the centuries of Muslim rule but only under the British colonial rule. Resistance to the exclusivist conception led to [[Savarkar]]'s ''Hindutva'', where Hinduism was seen both as a religion and a culture.{{sfn|Sharma|2008|pp=25-26}} ''Hindutva'' is a national Hindu-ness, by which a Hindu is one born in India and behaves like a Hindu. [[M. S. Golwalkar]] even spoke of "Hindu Muslims," meaning "Hindu by culture, Muslim by religion." {{sfn|Sridharan|2000|pp=13-14}}

Among the earliest known records of 'Hindu' with connotations of religion may be in the 7th-century CE Chinese text ''Record of the Western Regions'' by the Buddhist scholar [[Xuanzang]].  Xuanzang uses the transliterated term ''In-tu'' whose "connotation overflows in the religious" according to [[Arvind Sharma]].<ref name=arvindsharmahhhh/> While Xuanzang suggested that the term refers to the country named after the moon, another Buddhist scholar [[I-tsing]] contradicted the conclusion saying that ''In-tu'' was not a common name for the country.{{sfn|Jha|2009|p=15}}

[[Al-Biruni]]'s 11th-century text ''Tarikh Al-Hind'', and the texts of the Delhi Sultanate period use the term 'Hindu', where it includes all non-Islamic people such as Buddhists, and retains the ambiguity of being "a region or a religion".<ref name=arvindsharmahhhh/> The 'Hindu' community occurs as the amorphous 'Other' of the Muslim community in the court chronicles, according to [[Romila Thapar]].<ref name="Thapar tyranny">{{citation |last=Thapar |first=Romila |authorlink=Romila Thapar |title=The Tyranny of Labels |journal=Social Scientist |volume=24 |number=9/10 |year=1996 |pp=3–23 |JSTOR=3520140 |doi=10.2307/3520140}}</ref> [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]] notes that 'Hindu' retained its geographical reference initially: 'Indian', 'indigenous, local', virtually 'native'.

'Hindu', or 'Hindoo', was used towards the end of the eighteenth century by the British to refer to the people of 'Hindustan', the people of northwest India. Eventually 'Hindu' became virtually equivalent to an 'Indian' who was not a Muslim, Sikh, Jain or Christian, thereby encompassing a range of religious beliefs and practices.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=6}}

The text ''[[Prithviraj Raso]]'', by Chanda Baradai, about the 1192 CE defeat of [[Prithviraj Chauhan]] at the hands of [[Muhammad Ghori]], is full of references to "Hindus" and "Turks", and at one stage, says "both the religions have drawn their curved swords;" however, the date of this text is unclear and considered by most scholars to be more recent.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=33}} In Islamic literature, 'Abd al-Malik Isami's Persian work, ''Futuhu's-salatin'', composed in the Deccan in 1350, uses the word ''{{'}}{{not a typo|hindi}}' '' to mean Indian in the ethno-geographical sense and the word '''{{not a typo|hindu}}' '' to mean 'Hindu' in the sense of a follower of the Hindu religion".{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=33}} The poet [[Vidyapati]]'s poem ''Kirtilata'' contrasts the cultures of Hindus and Turks (Muslims) in a city and concludes "The Hindus and the Turks live close together; Each makes fun of the other's religion (''dhamme'')."{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=31}} One of the earliest uses of word 'Hindu' in religious context in a European language (Spanish), was the publication in 1649 by Sebastiao Manrique.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|p=15}}

Other prominent mentions of 'Hindu' include the epigraphical inscriptions from Andhra Pradesh kingdoms who battled military expansion of Muslim dynasties in 14th century, where the word 'Hindu' partly implies a religious identity in contrast to 'Turks' or Islamic religious identity.{{sfn|Lorenzen|2006|pp=32-33}} The term ''Hindu'' was later used occasionally in some Sanskrit texts such as the later [[Rajatarangini]]s of Kashmir (Hinduka, c. 1450) and some 16th- to 18th-century [[Bengali language|Bengali]] [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism|Gaudiya Vaishnava]] texts including ''[[Chaitanya Charitamrita]]'' and ''[[Chaitanya Bhagavata]]''. These texts used it to contrast Hindus from Muslims who are called [[Yona#Later meanings|Yavanas]] (foreigners) or [[Mlecchas]] (barbarians), with the 16th-century ''Chaitanya Charitamrita'' text and the 17th century ''Bhakta Mala'' text using the phrase "Hindu [[dharma]]".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Word 'Hindu' in Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Texts| author = O'Conell, Joseph T.| journal= Journal of the American Oriental Society| volume= 93| number =3 | year =1973| pages=340–344| doi=10.2307/599467}}</ref>

===Medieval era usage (8th- to 18th-century)===
One of the earliest but ambiguous use of the word Hindu is, states [[Arvind Sharma]], in the 'Brahmanabad settlement' which Muhammad ibn Qasim made with non-Muslims after the Arab invasion of northwestern Sindh region of India, in 712 CE. The term 'Hindu' meant people who were non-Muslims, and it included Buddhists of the region.<ref name=arvindsharmahhhh2>Arvind Sharma (2002), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, pages 5-9</ref> In the 11th-century text of Al Biruni, Hindus are referred to as "religious antagonists" to Islam, as those who believe in rebirth, presents them to hold a diversity of beliefs, and seems to oscillate between Hindus holding a centralist and pluralist religious views.<ref name=arvindsharmahhhh2/> In the texts of Delhi Sultanate era, states Sharma, the term Hindu remains ambiguous on whether it means people of a region or religion, giving the example of Ibn Battuta's explanation of the name "Hindu  Kush" for a mountain range in Afghanistan. It was so called, wrote Ibn Battuta, because many Indian slaves died there of snow cold, as they were marched across that mountain range. The term ''Hindu'' there is ambivalent, and could mean geographical region or religion.<ref>Arvind Sharma (2002), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/3270470 On Hindu, Hindustān, Hinduism and Hindutva] Numen, Vol. 49, Fasc. 1, page 9</ref>

In the texts from the Mughal Empire era, the term Hindu appears to refer to the people of India who had not converted to Islam. Pashaura Singh states, "in Persian writings, Sikhs were regarded as Hindu in the sense of non-Muslim Indians".<ref>Pashaura Singh (2005), Understanding the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan, Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), page 37</ref> Jahangir, for example, called the Sikh Guru Arjan a Hindu pretending to be a saint, someone he wanted to eliminate or convert to Islam, for a long time.<ref>Pashaura Singh (2005), Understanding the Martyrdom of Guru Arjan, Journal of Punjab Studies, 12(1), pages 29-31</ref>

{{Quote|
There was a Hindu named Arjan in Gobindwal on the banks of the Beas River. Pretending to be a spiritual guide, he had won over as devotees many simple minded Indians and even some ignorant, stupid Muslims by broadcasting his claims to be a saint. They called him guru. Many fools from all around had recourse to him and believed in him implicitly. For three or four generations they had been pedaling this same stuff. For a long time I had been thinking that either this false trade should be eliminated or that he should be brought into the embrace of Islam. At length, when Khusraw passed by there, this inconsequential little fellow wished to pay homage to Khusraw. When Khusraw stopped at his residence, [Arjan] came out and had an interview with [Khusraw]. Giving him some elementary spiritual precepts picked up here and there, he made a mark with saffron on his forehead, which is called qashqa in the idiom of the Hindus and which they consider lucky. When this was reported to me, I realized how perfectly false he was and ordered him brought to me. I awarded his [Guru Arjan's] houses and dwellings and those of his children to Murtaza Khan, and I ordered his possessions and goods confiscated and him executed.

===Colonial era usage (18th- to 20th-century)===
During the colonial era, the term Hindu had connotations of native religions of India, that is religions other than Christianity and Islam.<ref name=gauri>Gauri Viswanathan (1998), Outside the Fold: Conversion, Modernity, and Belief, Princeton University Press, ISBN 978-0691058993, page 78</ref> In early colonial era Anglo-Hindu laws and British India court system, the term Hindu referred to people of all Indian religions and two non-Indian religions:

{{Quote|
The colonial project was itself undermined by its own constitutive contradictions, since many of these laws were no more intrinsic to Indian society than the proposed meld of English and Indian systems. (...) The application of laws derived from Sanskrit classical texts leveled the community of '''Hindus''' to include all those who were not Muslims or Christians, and it absorbed under the category of "Hindu" both outcastes and members of religions as diverse as Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Judaism and Zorastrianism.
|Gauri Viswanathan, ''Outside the Fold: Conversion, Modernity, and Belief''|<ref name=gauri/>}}

The 20th-century colonial laws of British India segregated people's rights by their religion, evolving to provide Muslims with sharia law, Christians, Jews and Paris of British India with their own religious laws. The British government created a compendium of religious laws for Hindus, and the term 'Hindu' in these colonial 'Hindu laws', decades before India's independence, applied to Buddhists, Jains and Sikhs.<ref name=rachel>Rachel Sturman (2010), Hinduism and Law: An Introduction (Editors: Timothy Lubin et al), Cambridge University Press, ISBN 978-0521716260, pages 90-96</ref>

Beyond the stipulations of British law, colonial [[orientalism|orientalists]] and particularly the influential Asiatick Researches founded in the 18th-century, later called [[The Asiatic Society]], initially identified just two religions in India – Islam and Hinduism. These orientialists included all Indian religions such as Buddhism as a subgroup of Hinduism in the 18th-century.<ref name=brian111>Brian Pennington (2007), Was Hinduism Invented?: Britons, Indians, and the Colonial Construction of Religion, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0195326000, pages 111-118</ref> These texts called followers of Islam as ''Mohamedans'', and all others as ''Hindus''. The text, by early 19th century, began dividing Hindus into separate groups, for chronology studies of the various beliefs. Among the earliest terms to emerge were ''Seeks and their College'' (later spelled Sikhs by Charles Wilkins), ''Boudhism'' (later spelled Buddhism), and in the 9th volume of Asiatick Researches report on religions in India, the term ''Jainism'' received notice.<ref name=brian111/>

According to Pennington, the terms Hindu and Hinduism were thus constructed for colonial studies of India. The various sub-divisions and separation of subgroup terms were assumed to be result of "communal conflict", and Hindu was constructed by these orientalists to imply people who adhered to "ancient default oppressive religious substratum of India", states Pennington.<ref name=brian111/> Followers of other Indian religions so identified were later referred Buddhists, Sikhs or Jains and distinguished from Hindus, in an antagonistic two-dimensional manner, with Hindus and Hinduism stereotyped as irrational traditional and others as rational reform religions. However, these mid 19th century reports offered no indication of doctrinal or ritual differences between Hindu and Buddhist, or other newly constructed religious identities.<ref name=brian111/> These colonial studies, states Pennigton, "puzzled endlessly about the Hindus and intensely scrutinized them, but did not interrogate and avoided reporting the practices and religion of Mughal and Arabs in South Asia", and often relied on Muslim scholars to characterize Hindus.<ref name=brian111/>

===Contemporary usage===
In contemporary era, the term Hindus are individuals who identify with one or more aspects of [[Hinduism]], whether they are practicing or non-practicing or ''laissez faire''.<ref>Bryan Turner (2010), The New Blackwell Companion to the Sociology of Religion, John Wiley & Sons, ISBN 978-1405188524, pages 424-425</ref> The term does not include those who identify with other Indian religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism or various animist tribal religions found in India such as ''Sarnaism''.<ref name="Marty1996"/><ref>James Minahan (2012), Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific: An Encyclopedia, ISBN 978-1598846591, pages 97-99</ref> The term Hindu, in contemporary parlance, includes people who accept themselves as culturally or ethnically Hindu rather than with a fixed set of religious beliefs within Hinduism.<ref name=jefferylong/> One need not be religious in the minimal sense, states [[Julius J.

:When we think of the Hindu religion, unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any one prophet; it does not worship any one god; it does not subscribe to any one dogma; it does not believe in any one philosophic concept; it does not follow any one set of religious rites or performances; in fact, it does not appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any religion or [[creed]].

===Disputes===

In the [[Constitution of India]], the word "Hindu" has been used in some places to denote persons professing any of these religions: [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]] or [[Sikhism]].<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/most/rr3indi.htm India-Constitution:Religious rights] Article 25:''"Explanation II: In sub-Clause (b) of clause (2), the reference to Hindus shall be construed as including a reference to persons professing the Sikh, Jaina or Buddhist religion"''</ref> This however has been challenged by the Sikhs<ref name="Marty1996">{{cite book|author=Martin E.

The [[Republic of India]] is in the peculiar situation that the [[Supreme Court of India]] has repeatedly been called upon to define "Hinduism" because the [[Constitution of India]], while it prohibits "discrimination of any citizen" on grounds of religion in article 15, article 30 foresees special rights for "All minorities, whether based on religion or language". As a consequence, religious groups have an interest in being recognized as distinct from the Hindu majority in order to qualify as a "religious minority". Thus, the Supreme Court was forced to consider the question whether [[Jainism]] is part of Hinduism in 2005 and 2006. In the 2006 verdict, the Supreme Court found that the "Jain Religion is indisputably not a part of the Hindu Religion".<ref name="School Bal Vidya Mandir 2003"/>

==History of Hindu identity==
Starting after 10th century and particularly after the 12th century Islamic invasion, states Sheldon Pollock, the political response fused with the Indic religious culture and doctrines.<ref name=pollockdevagiri>Sheldon Pollock (1993), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2059648 Rāmāyaṇa and political imagination in India], Journal of Asian studies, Vol. 52, No. 2, pages 266-269</ref> Temples dedicated to deity [[Rama]] were built from north to south India, and textual records as well as hagiographic inscriptions began comparing the Hindu epic of [[Ramayana]] to regional kings and their response to Islamic attacks. The [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Yadava]] king of [[Devagiri]] named ''Ramacandra'', for example states Pollock, is described in a 13th-century record as, "How is this Rama to be described.. who freed [[Varanasi]] from the ''mleccha'' (barbarian, Turk Muslim) horde, and built there a golden temple of Sarngadhara".<ref name=pollockdevagiri/> Pollock notes that the Yadava king ''Ramacandra'' is described as a devotee of deity [[Shiva]] (Shaivism), yet his political achievements and temple construction sponsorship in Varanasi, far from his kingdom's location in the Deccan region, is described in the historical records in Vaishnavism terms of Rama, a deity [[Vishnu]] avatar.<ref name=pollockdevagiri/> Pollock presents many such examples and suggests an emerging Hindu political identity that was grounded in the Hindu religious text of Ramayana, one that has continued into the modern times, and suggests that this historic process began with the arrival of Islam in India.<ref>Sheldon Pollock (1993), [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2059648 Rāmāyaṇa and political imagination in India], Journal of Asian studies, Vol. 52, No. 2, pages 261-297</ref>

Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya has questioned the Pollock theory and presented textual and inscriptional evidence.<ref name=brajadulal2004/> According to Chattopadhyaya, the Hindu identity and religious response to Islamic invasion and wars developed in different kingdoms, such as wars between Islamic Sultanates and the Vijayanagara kingdom ([[Karnataka]]), and Islamic raids on the kingdoms in [[Tamil Nadu]]. These wars were described not just using the mythical story of Rama from Ramayana, states Chattopadhyaya, the medieval records used a wide range of religious symbolism and myths that are now considered as part of Hindu literature.<ref name=brajadulal>Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (1998), Representing the other?: Sanskrit sources and the Muslims (eighth to fourteenth century), Manohar Publications, ISBN 978-8173042522, pages 92-103, Chapter 1 and 2</ref><ref name=brajadulal2004>Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (2004), Other or the Others? in ''The World in the Year 1000'' (Editors: James Heitzman, Wolfgang Schenkluhn), University Press of America, ISBN 978-0761825616, pages 303-323</ref> This emergence of religious with political terminology began with the first Muslim invasion of Sindh in the 8th century CE, and intensified 13th century onwards. The 14th-century Sanskrit text, ''Madhuravijayam'', a memoir written by ''Gangadevi'', the wife of Vijayanagara prince, for example describes the consequences of war using religious terms,<ref name=brajadulal306/>

{{Quote|
<poem>
I very much lament for what happened to the groves in Madhura,
The coconut trees have all been cut and in their place are to be seen,
  rows of iron spikes with human skulls dangling at the points,
In the highways which were once charming with anklets sound of beautiful women, 
  are now heard ear-piercing noises of Brahmins being dragged, bound in iron-fetters,
The waters of Tambraparni, which were once white with sandal paste,
  are now flowing red with the blood of cows slaughtered by miscreants,
Earth is no longer the producer of wealth, nor does [[Indra]] give timely rains,
The [[Yama|God of death]] takes his undue toll of what are left lives if undestroyed by the Yavanas [Muslims],<ref>the terms were Persians, Tajikas or Arabs, and Turushkas or Turks, states Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya (2004), Other or the Others? in ''The World in the Year 1000'' (Editors: James Heitzman, Wolfgang Schenkluhn), University Press of America, ISBN 978-0761825616, pages 303-319</ref>
The Kali age now deserves deepest congratulations for being at the zenith of its power,
gone is the sacred learning, hidden is refinement, hushed is the voice of [[Dharma]].

Andrew Nicholson, in his review of scholarship on Hindu identity history, states that the vernacular literature of [[Bhakti movement]] sants from 15th to 17th century, such as [[Kabir]], Anantadas, Eknath, Vidyapati, suggests that distinct religious identities, between Hindus and Turks (Muslims), had formed during these centuries.<ref name=andrewnicholson/> The poetry of this period contrasts Hindu and Islamic identities, states Nicholson, and the literature vilifies the Muslims coupled with a "distinct sense of a Hindu religious identity".<ref name=andrewnicholson>Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, ISBN 978-0231149877, pages 198-199</ref>

Scholars state that Hindu, Buddhist and Jain identities are retrospectively-introduced modern constructions.<ref name=leslie/> Inscriptional evidence from 8th-century onwards, in regions such as South India suggests that medieval era India, at both elite and folk religious practices level, likely had a "shared religious culture",<ref name=leslie>Leslie Orr (2014), Donors, Devotees, and Daughters of God, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0195356724, pages 25-26, 204</ref> and their collective identities were "multiple, layered and fuzzy".<ref name=leslieorr>Leslie Orr (2014), Donors, Devotees, and Daughters of God, Oxford University Press, ISBN 978-0195356724, pages 42, 204</ref> Even among Hinduism denominations such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism, the Hindu identities, states Leslie Orr, lacked "firm definitions and clear boundaries".<ref name=leslieorr/>

===Hindu nationalism===
{{main|Hindu nationalism|Hindutva}}
Christophe Jaffrelot states that modern Hindu nationalism was born in [[Maharashtra]], in the 1920s, as a reaction to the Islamic [[Khilafat Movement]] wherein Indian Muslims championed and took the cause of the Turkish Ottoman sultan as the Caliph of all Muslims, at the end of the [[World War I]].<ref name=chrisjaffrelot/><ref name=minault>Gail Minault (1982), The Khilafat Movement: Religious Symbolism and Political Mobilization in India, Columbia University Press, ISBN 978-0231050722, pages 1-11 and Preface section</ref> Hindus viewed this development as one of divided loyalties of Indian Muslim population, of pan-Islamic hegemony, and questioned whether Indian Muslims were a part of an inclusive anti-colonial Indian nationalism.<ref name=minault/> The Hindu nationalism ideology that emerged, states Jeffrelot, was codified by Savarkar while he was a political prisoner of the British colonial empire.<ref name=chrisjaffrelot>Christophe Jaffrelot (2007), Hindu Nationalism: A Reader, Princeton University Press, ISBN 978-0691130989, pages 13-15</ref><ref>Amalendu Misra (2004), Identity and Religion, SAGE Publications, ISBN 978-0761932260, pages 148-188</ref>

Chris Bayly traces the roots of Hindu nationalism to the Hindu identity and political independence achieved by the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha confederacy]], that overthrew the Islamic Mughal empire in large parts of India, allowing Hindus the freedom to pursue any of their diverse religious beliefs and restored Hindu holy places such as Varanasi.<ref>CA Bayly (1985), The pre-history of communialism?

"A radical assessment of the Vedic heritage" in ''Representing Hinduism: The Construction of Religious and National Identity'', Sage Publ., Delhi, 1995.</ref> Jaffrelot states that the efforts of Christian missionaries and Islamic proselytizers, during the British colonial era, each of whom tried to gain new converts to their own religion, by stereotyping and stigmatizing Hindus to an identity of being inferior and superstitious, contributed to Hindus re-asserting their spiritual heritage and counter cross examining Islam and Christianity, forming organizations such as the ''Hindu Sabhas'' (Hindu associations), and ultimately a Hindu-identity driven nationalism in the 1920s.<ref name=chrisjaffrelot2>Christophe Jaffrelot (2007), Hindu Nationalism: A Reader, Princeton University Press, ISBN 978-0691130989, pages 13</ref>

The colonial era Hindu revivalism and mobilization, along with Hindu nationalism, states Peter van der Veer, was primarily a reaction to and competition with Muslim separatism and Muslim nationalism.<ref name=peterveer/> The successes of each side fed the fears of the other, leading to the growth of Hindu nationalism and Muslim nationalism in the Indian subcontinent.<ref name=peterveer>Peter van der Veer (1994), Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India, University of California Press, ISBN 978-0520082564, pages 11-14, 1-24</ref> In 20th century, the sense of religious nationalism grew in India, notes van der Veer, but only Muslim nationalism succeeded with the formation of the Islamic state of Pakistan (later split into Pakistan and Bangladesh).<ref name=peterveer53/> Religious riots and social trauma followed as millions of Hindus, Jains, Buddhists and Sikhs moved out of the newly created Islamic states and resettled into the Hindu-majority post-British India.<ref name=peterveer53>Peter van der Veer (1994), Religious Nationalism: Hindus and Muslims in India, University of California Press, ISBN 978-0520082564, pages 26-32, 53-54</ref> After the separation of India and Pakistan in 1947, the Hindu nationalism movement developed the concept of [[Hindutva]] in second half of the 20th century.<ref name = RamPrasad>Ram-Prasad, C.

The Hindu nationalism movement has sought to reform Indian laws, that critics say attempts to impose Hindu values on India's Islamic minority. Gerald Larson states, for example, that Hindu nationalists have sought a uniform civil code, where all citizens are subject to the same laws, everyone has equal civil rights, and individual rights do not depend on the individual's religion.<ref name=larson55>GJ Larson (2002), Religion and Personal Law in Secular India: A Call to Judgment, Indiana University Press, ISBN 978-0253214805, pages 55-56</ref> In contrast, opponents of Hindu nationalists remark that eliminating religious law from India poses a threat to the cultural identity and religious rights of Muslims, and people of Islamic faith have a constitutional right to Islamic [[sharia]]h-based personal laws.<ref name=larson55/><ref>John Mansfield (2005), The Personal Laws or a Uniform Civil Code?, in Religion and Law in Independent India (Editor: Robert Baird), Manohar, ISBN 978-8173045882, page 121-127, 135-136, 151-156</ref> A specific law, contentious between Hindu nationalists and their opponents in India, relates to the legal age of marriage for girls.<ref name=sylviavatuk/> Hindu nationalists seek that the legal age for marriage be eighteen that is universally applied to all girls regardless of their religion and that marriages be registered with local government to verify the age of marriage.
