'''Henri-Émile-Benoît Matisse''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃ʁi emil bənwɑ matis|lang}}; 31 December 1869 – 3 November 1954) was a French artist, known for both his use of colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship. He was a [[drawing|draughtsman]], [[printmaking|printmaker]], and [[sculpture|sculptor]], but is known primarily as a painter.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Myers|first=Terry R.|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=July–August 2010|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2010/07/artseen/matisse-on-the-move|title=Matisse-on-the-Move}}</ref>

Matisse is commonly regarded, along with [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the [[plastic arts]] throughout the opening decades of the twentieth century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/matisse-picasso |title=Tate Modern: Matisse Picasso |publisher=Tate.org.uk |accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Adrian Searle |url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/07/artsfeatures |title=Searle, Adrian, ''A momentous, tremendous exhibition'', The Guardian, Tuesday 7 May 2002 |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 7 May 2002|accessdate=13 February 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/matisse-amp-picasso-75440861/?no-ist |title=Trachtman, Paul, ''Matisse & Picasso'', Smithsonian, February 2003 |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |accessdate=13 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4059997.stm| title=Duchamp's urinal tops art survey |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=10 December 2010|date=1 December 2004}}</ref> Although he was initially labelled a [[Fauvism|Fauve]] (wild beast), by the 1920s he was increasingly hailed as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting.<ref>Wattenmaker, Richard J.; Distel, Anne, et al.

His mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in [[modern art]].<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mati/hd_mati.htm Magdalena Dabrowski Department of Nineteenth-Century, Modern, and Contemporary Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art Source: Henri Matisse (1869–1954) | Thematic Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art] Retrieved 30 June 2010</ref>

==Early life and education==
[[File:Henri + Amélie Matisse Portrait 1898.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Henri and Amélie Matisse, 1898]]
[[File:Reading henri matisse.jpg|thumb|''[[Woman Reading]]'', 1894, Museum of Modern Art, Paris]]
Matisse was born in [[Le Cateau-Cambrésis]], in the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] [[Departments of France|department]] in northern [[France]], the oldest son of a prosperous grain merchant.<ref>Spurling, Hilary (2000). ''The Unknown Matisse: A Life of Henri Matisse: The Early Years, 1869–1908''. University of California Press, 2001. ISBN 0-520-22203-2. pp. 4–6</ref> He grew up in [[Bohain-en-Vermandois]], Picardie, France. In 1887 he went to Paris to study law, working as a court administrator in [[Le Cateau-Cambrésis]] after gaining his qualification. He first started to paint in 1889, after his mother brought him art supplies during a period of convalescence following an attack of [[appendicitis]]. He discovered "a kind of paradise" as he later described it,<ref>Leymarie, Jean; Read, Herbert; Lieberman, William S. (1966), ''Henri Matisse'', UCLA Art Council, p.9.</ref> and decided to become an artist, deeply disappointing his father.<ref name="kuester">Bärbel Küster. "Arbeiten und auf niemanden hören." ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 6 July 2007. {{de icon}}</ref><ref name=unknown/>

In 1891 he returned to Paris to study art at the [[Académie Julian]] and became a student of [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]] and [[Gustave Moreau]]. Initially he painted [[still life]]s and landscapes in a traditional style, at which he achieved reasonable proficiency. Matisse was influenced by the works of earlier masters such as [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], [[Nicolas Poussin]], and [[Antoine Watteau]], as well as by modern artists, such as [[Édouard Manet]], and by [[Japanese art]]. Chardin was one of the painters Matisse most admired; as an art student he made copies of four of Chardin's paintings in the [[Louvre]].<ref>Spurling, Hilary. ''The Unknown Matisse: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Early Years, 1869–1908''. p.86. accessed online 15 July 2007</ref>

In 1896 and 1897, Matisse visited the Australian painter [[John Peter Russell]] on the island [[Belle Île]] off the coast of [[Brittany]]. Russell introduced him to [[Impressionism]] and to the work of [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], who had been a friend of Russell but was completely unknown at the time. Matisse's style changed completely. He later said "Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained [[colour theory]] to me."<ref name=unknown/> In 1896 Matisse exhibited five paintings in the salon of the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]], two of which were purchased by the state.<ref>[http://www.cosmopolis.ch/english/cosmo2/matisse.htm Henri and Pierre Matisse], ''Cosmopolis'', No 2, January 1999</ref>

With the model Caroline Joblau, he had a daughter, Marguerite, born in 1894. In 1898 he married Amélie Noellie Parayre; the two raised Marguerite together and had two sons, Jean (born 1899) and Pierre (born 1900). Marguerite and Amélie often served as models for Matisse.<ref>[http://www.xs4all.nl/~androom/biography/p018905.htm Marguerite Matisse] Retrieved 13 December 2010</ref>

In 1898, on the advice of [[Camille Pissarro]], he went to London to study the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]] and then went on a trip to [[Corsica]].<ref name="Oxford">Oxford Art Online, "Henri Matisse"</ref> Upon his return to Paris in February 1899, he worked beside [[Albert Marquet]] and met [[André Derain]], [[Jean Puy]],<ref name="UCLA10" /> and [[Jules Flandrin]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=crcOQXhtobsC&printsec=frontcover&dq=jules+flandrin&source=bl&ots=dbFVRpY9ae&sig=dYAoIIrRkGM5-oYD4LA5o_kjUDk&hl=en&ei=pAWrS5HMC8qWtgewppi2Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=matisse&f=false] on page 23 of Google Book Link</ref> Matisse immersed himself in the work of others and went into debt from buying work from painters he admired. The work he hung and displayed in his home included a plaster bust by [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], a painting by [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin]], a drawing by [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]]'s ''Three Bathers''. In Cézanne's sense of pictorial structure and colour, Matisse found his main inspiration.<ref name="UCLA10">Leymarie, Jean; Read, Herbert; Lieberman, William S. (1966), ''Henri Matisse'', UCLA Art Council, p.10.</ref>

Many of Matisse's paintings from 1898 to 1901 make use of a [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] technique he adopted after reading [[Paul Signac]]'s essay, "D'Eugène Delacroix au Néo-impressionisme".<ref name="Oxford" /> His paintings of 1902–03, a period of material hardship for the artist, are comparatively somber and reveal a preoccupation with form. Having made his first attempt at sculpture, a copy after [[Antoine-Louis Barye]], in 1899, he devoted much of his energy to working in clay, completing ''The Slave'' in 1903.<ref>Leymarie, Jean; Read, Herbert; Lieberman, William S. (1966), ''Henri Matisse'', UCLA Art Council, pp.19–20.</ref>

==Fauvism==
{{Main|Fauvism}}
[[File:Matisse-Woman-with-a-Hat.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Woman with a Hat]]'', 1905. [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]]]]
[[Fauvism]] as a style began around 1900 and continued beyond 1910. The [[Art movement|movement]] as such lasted only a few years, 1904–1908, and had three exhibitions.<ref name=elderfield13>[[John Elderfield]], The ''"Wild Beasts" Fauvism and Its Affinities,'' 1976, [[Museum of Modern Art]], p.13, ISBN 0-87070-638-1</ref><ref>Freeman, Judi, et al., ''The Fauve Landscape'', 1990, Abbeville Press, p. 13, ISBN 1-55859-025-0.</ref> The leaders of the movement were Matisse and [[André Derain]].<ref name=elderfield13/> Matisse's first solo exhibition was at [[Ambroise Vollard]]'s gallery in 1904,<ref name="UCLA10" /> without much success. His fondness for bright and expressive colour became more pronounced after he spent the summer of 1904 painting in [[St. Tropez]] with the [[neo-Impressionism|neo-Impressionist]]s Signac and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].<ref name="Oxford" /> In that year he painted the most important of his works in the neo-Impressionist style, ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]''.<ref name="Oxford" /> In 1905 he travelled southwards again to work with [[André Derain]] at [[Collioure]]. His paintings of this period are characterised by flat shapes and controlled lines, using [[pointillism]] in a less rigorous way than before.

Matisse and a group of artists now known as "[[Fauvism|Fauves]]" exhibited together in a room at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in 1905. The paintings expressed emotion with wild, often dissonant colours, without regard for the subject's natural colours. Matisse showed ''Open Window'' and ''Woman with the Hat'' at the Salon. Critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] described the work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] parmi les fauves!" (Donatello among the wild beasts), referring to a [[Renaissance]]-type sculpture that shared the room with them.<ref name=oup-fauvism>Chilver, Ian (Ed.). [http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/fauvism "Fauvism"], The Oxford Dictionary of Art, Oxford University Press, 2004. Retrieved from enotes.com, 26 December 2007.</ref> His comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in ''[[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]'', a daily newspaper, and passed into popular usage.<ref name=elderfield13/><ref name=oup-fauvism/> The exhibition garnered harsh criticism—"A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public", said the critic [[Camille Mauclair]]—but also some favourable attention.<ref name=oup-fauvism/> When the painting that was singled out for special condemnation, Matisse's ''[[Woman with a Hat]]'', was bought by [[Gertrude Stein|Gertrude]] and [[Leo Stein]], the embattled artist's morale improved considerably.<ref name=oup-fauvism/>
[[File:Matissetoits.gif|thumb|''[[Les toits de Collioure]]'', 1905, oil on canvas, [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]], [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]]]
Matisse was recognised as a leader of the Fauves, along with André Derain; the two were friendly rivals, each with his own followers. Other members were [[Georges Braque]], [[Raoul Dufy]], and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]]. The [[Symbolist]] painter [[Gustave Moreau]] (1826–1898) was the movement's inspirational teacher. As a professor at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris, he pushed his students to think outside of the lines of formality and to follow their visions.

In 1907 [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], commenting about Matisse in an article published in ''La Falange'', wrote, "We are not here in the presence of an extravagant or an extremist undertaking: Matisse's art is eminently reasonable."<ref>''Picasso and Braque pioneering cubism'', [[William Rubin]], published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, copyright 1989, ISBN 0-87070-676-4 p.348.</ref> But Matisse's work of the time also encountered vehement criticism, and it was difficult for him to provide for his family.<ref name=unknown/> His painting ''[[Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)|Nu bleu]]'' (1907) was burned in effigy at the [[Armory Show]] in Chicago in 1913.<ref name=eb>"Matisse, Henri." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Retrieved 30 July 2007.</ref>

The decline of the Fauvist movement after 1906 did not affect the career of Matisse; many of his finest works were created between 1906 and 1917, when he was an active part of the great gathering of artistic talent in [[Montparnasse]], even though he did not quite fit in, with his conservative appearance and strict [[bourgeois]] work habits. He continued to absorb new influences. He travelled to [[Algeria]] in 1906 studying African art and [[Primitivism]]. After viewing a large exhibition of [[Islamic art]] in Munich in 1910, he spent two months in Spain studying Moorish art. He visited [[Morocco]] in 1912 and again in 1913 and while painting in [[Tangiers]] he made several changes to his work, including his use of black as a colour.<ref name="The Moroccans">[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79588 ''The Moroccans'', MoMA]</ref><ref>[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/exhibitions/1990/matisse_morocco.html ''Matisse in Morocco: The Paintings and Drawings, 1912–1913'', NGA]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/06/22/arts/review-art-matisse-and-the-mark-left-on-him-by-morocco.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm Review: John Russell, ''Matisse and the Mark Left On Him By Morocco'', NY Times]</ref> The effect on Matisse's art was a new boldness in the use of intense, unmodulated colour, as in ''[[L'Atelier Rouge]]'' (1911).<ref name="Oxford" />

Matisse had a long association with the Russian art collector [[Sergei Shchukin]]. He created one of his major works ''[[The Dance (painting)|La Danse]]'' specially for Shchukin as part of a two painting commission, the other painting being ''Music,'' 1910. An earlier version of ''La Danse'' (1909) is in the collection of [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City.

Around April 1906 he met [[Pablo Picasso]], who was 11 years younger than Matisse.<ref name=unknown>[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1430343.htm The Unknown Matisse, pp 352–553...], [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], 8 June 2005</ref> The two became lifelong friends as well as rivals and are often compared. One key difference between them is that Matisse drew and painted from nature, while Picasso was much more inclined to work from imagination. The subjects painted most frequently by both artists were women and [[still life]], with Matisse more likely to place his figures in fully realised interiors. Matisse and Picasso were first brought together at the Paris [[salon (gathering)|salon]] of [[Gertrude Stein]] and her companion [[Alice B. Toklas]]. During the first decade of the twentieth century, the Americans in Paris—Gertrude Stein, her brothers [[Leo Stein]], Michael Stein and Michael's wife [[Sarah Stein|Sarah]]—were important collectors and supporters of Matisse's paintings. In addition Gertrude Stein's two American friends from [[Baltimore]], the [[Cone sisters]] Claribel and Etta, became major patrons of Matisse and Picasso, collecting hundreds of their paintings and drawings. The Cone collection is now exhibited in the [[Baltimore Museum of Art]].<ref>[http://www.artbma.org/collection/overview/cone.html Cone Collection], Baltimore Museum of Art.

While numerous artists visited the Stein salon, many of these artists were not represented among the paintings on the walls at [[27 rue de Fleurus]]. Where the works of [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso dominated Leo and Gertrude Stein's collection, Sarah Stein's collection particularly emphasised Matisse.<ref>(MoMA, 1970 at 28)</ref>

Contemporaries of Leo and Gertrude Stein, Matisse and Picasso became part of their social circle and routinely joined the gatherings that took place on Saturday evenings at 27 rue de Fleurus. Gertrude attributed the beginnings of the Saturday evening salons to Matisse, remarking:

<blockquote>"More and more frequently, people began visiting to see the Matisse paintings—and the Cézannes: Matisse brought people, everybody brought somebody, and they came at any time and it began to be a nuisance, and it was in this way that Saturday evenings began."<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 84</ref>'</blockquote>

Among Pablo Picasso's acquaintances who also frequented the Saturday evenings were: [[Fernande Olivier]] (Picasso's mistress), [[Georges Braque]], [[André Derain]], the poets [[Max Jacob]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Marie Laurencin]] (Apollinaire's mistress and an artist in her own right), and [[Henri Rousseau]].<ref>Mellow, 1974, p. 94-95</ref>

His friends organised and financed the ''Académie Matisse'' in Paris, a private and non-commercial school in which Matisse instructed young artists. It operated from 1907 until 1911. The initiative for the academy came from the Steins and the [[Le Dôme Café#Dômiers|Dômiers]], with the involvement of [[Hans Purrmann]], [[Patrick Henry Bruce]] and [[Sarah Stein]].<ref>[https://books.google.es/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&pg=PA64&dq=Hans+Purrmann+and+Sarah+Stein,+students+of+matisse&hl=en&sa=X&ei=flmbVZOWE4uBUaXhvJAL&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France, 1900-1940'', Pelican History of Art Series, Yale University Press, 2003, p. 64], ISBN 0300099088</ref>

Matisse spent seven months in [[Morocco]] from 1912 to 1913, producing about 24 paintings and numerous drawings. His frequent [[orientalism|orientalist]] topics of later paintings, such as [[odalisque]]s, can be traced to this period.<ref>{{cite book

==After Paris==
[[File:Odalisque with Arms Raised.jpg|thumb|180px|right|''[[Odalisque with Raised Arms|Odalisque with Arms Raised]]'', (of Henriette Darricarrière), 1923, [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, D.C.]]

In 1917 Matisse relocated to [[Cimiez]] on the [[French Riviera]], a suburb of the city of [[Nice]]. His work of the decade or so following this relocation shows a relaxation and a softening of his approach. This "[[return to order]]" is characteristic of much art of the post-[[World War I]] period and can be compared with the [[neoclassicism]] of Picasso and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] as well as the return to traditionalism of [[André Derain|Derain]].
His [[orientalism|orientalist]] [[odalisque]] paintings are characteristic of the period; while this work was popular, some contemporary critics found it shallow and decorative.<ref>Jack Cowart and Dominique Fourcade. ''Henri Matisse: The Early Years in Nice 1916–1930''. Henry N. Abrams, Inc., 1986. p. 47. ISBN 978-0810914421.</ref>

In the late 1920s Matisse once again engaged in active collaborations with other artists. He worked with not only Frenchmen, Dutch, Germans, and Spaniards, but also a few Americans and recent American immigrants.

After 1930 a new vigor and bolder simplification appeared in his work. American art collector [[Albert C. Barnes]] convinced him to produce a large mural for the [[Barnes Foundation]], ''[[The Dance II]]'', which was completed in 1932; the Foundation owns several dozen other Matisse paintings. This move toward simplification and a foreshadowing of the cutout technique are also evident in his painting ''Large Reclining Nude'' (1935). Matisse worked on this painting over a period of several months and documented the progress with a series of 22 photographs which he sent to Etta Cone.<ref>[http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html Henri Matisse Photographic documentation of 22 progressive states of Large Reclining Nude, 1935], The Jewish Museum {{wayback|url=http://www.thejewishmuseum.org/site/pages/uploaded_media/cone/matisse/index.html |date=20150117213857 |df=y }}</ref>

==The war years==
[[File:Henri Matisse Annelies.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Annelies, White Tulips and Anemones]]'' 1944]]
Matisse's wife Amélie, who suspected that he was having an affair with her young Russian emigre companion,  Lydia Delectorskaya, ended their 41-year marriage in July, 1939, dividing their possessions equally between them.  Delectorskaya attempted suicide by shooting herself in the chest; remarkably, she survived with no serious after-effects, and instead returned to the now-single Matisse and worked with him for the rest of his life,  running his household, paying the bills, typing his correspondence, keeping meticulous records, assisting in the studio and coordinating his business affairs.<ref>http://www.henri-matisse.net/biography.html</ref>

Matisse was visiting Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June, 1940, but managed to make his way back to Nice.   His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while it was still possible.  Matisse was, in fact, about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation, but abruptly changed his mind and remained in Nice, in Vichy France.  “It seemed to me as if I would be deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September, 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?”  Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their greatest artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.<ref>"Art & Politics in the Vichy Period," by Hilton Kramer, The New Criterion, March, 1992 http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/Art---politics-in-the-Vichy-period-4518</ref>

While the Nazis occupied France from 1940-1944, they were more lenient in their attacks on "degenerate art" in Paris than they were in the German-speaking nations under their military dictatorship. Matisse was allowed to exhibit along with other former Fauves and Cubists whom Hitler had initially claimed to despise, though without any Jewish artists, all of whose works had been purged from all French museums and galleries; any French artists exhibiting in France had to sign an oath assuring their "Aryan" status - including Matisse.<ref>Paris in the Third Reich: A History of the German Occupation, 1940-1944, by David Pryce-Jones; Holt, Rinehart & Winston (1981), page 220</ref>  He also worked as a graphic artist and produced black-and-white illustrations for several books and over one hundred original lithographs at the [[Mourlot Studios]] in Paris.

In 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with duodenal cancer. The surgery, while successful, resulted in serious complications from which he nearly died.<ref>"Matisse: A biography" by Patricia Daniels,</ref> Being bedridden for three months resulted in his developing a new art form using paper and scissors  (see following section) <ref>{{Citation

That same year,  a nursing student named Monique Bourgeois responded to an ad placed by Matisse for a nurse. A platonic friendship developed between Matisse and Bourgeois. He discovered that she was an amateur artist, and taught her about perspective. After Bourgeois left the position to join a convent in 1944, Matisse sometimes contacted her to request that she model for him. Bourgeois became a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] nun in 1946, and Matisse painted a chapel in Vence, a small town he moved to in 1943, in her honor. (See section below, "The Chapel and the Museum")

Matisse remained for the most part isolated in southern France throughout the war. Nonetheless, his family was intimately involved with the French resistance. His son Pierre, the art dealer in New York, helped the Jewish and anti-Nazi French artists he represented to escape occupied France and enter the United States. In 1942, he held an exhibit in New York, "Artists in Exile," which was to become legendary.  Matisse's estranged wife, Amelie, was a typist for the French Underground and jailed for six months.  And Matisse was shocked when he heard that his daughter Marguerite, who had been active in the [[Résistance]] during the war, was tortured (almost to death) by the Gestapo in a Rennes prison and sentenced to the [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] in Germany.<ref name=kuester/>  Marguerite managed to escape from the Ravensbrück-bound train, which was halted during an Allied air strike; she survived in the woods in the chaos of the closing days of the war, until rescued by fellow resisters.<ref>Heftrig, Ruth; Olaf Peters; Barbara Maria Schellewald [editors] (2008), ''Kunstgeschichte im "Dritten Reich": Theorien, Methoden, Praktiken'', Akademie Verlag, p. 429; Spurling, Hilary, ''Matisse the Master: A Life of Henri Matisse, the Conquest of Colour, 1909–1954'', p.424.</ref>

===The cut-outs===
{{See also|Jazz (Henri Matisse)}}
Diagnosed with abdominal cancer in 1941, Matisse underwent surgery that left him chair and bed bound. Painting and sculpture had become physical challenges, so he turned to a new type of medium. With the help of his assistants, he began creating cut paper collages, or [[decoupage]]. He would cut sheets of paper, pre-painted with [[gouache]] by his assistants, into shapes of varying colours and sizes, and arrange them to form lively compositions. Initially, these pieces were modest in size, but eventually transformed into murals or room-sized works. The result was a distinct and dimensional complexity—an art form that was not quite painting, but not quite sculpture.<ref>{{Citation | last =Cotter | first =Holland| title =Wisps From an Old Man’s Dreams ‘Henri Matisse: The Cut-Outs,’ a Victory Lap at MoMA

Although the paper cut-out was Matisse’s major medium in the final decade of his life, his first recorded use of the technique was in 1919 during the design of decor for the ''[[Le chant du rossignol]]'', an opera made by [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref name="The Cut-outs" /> [[Albert C. Barnes]] arranged for cardboard templates to be made of the unusual dimensions of the walls onto which Matisse, in his studio in Nice, fixed the composition of painted paper shapes. Another group of cut-outs were made between 1937 and 1938, while Matisse was working on the stage sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev's [[Ballets Russes]]. However, it was only after his operation that, bedridden, Matisse began to develop the cut-out technique as its own form, rather than its prior utilitarian origin.<ref name="Elderfield 1978 8">{{cite book
 | last =Elderfield | first =John | title =The Cut-Outs of Henri Matisse | publisher =George Braziller | date =1978 | location =New York | pages =8 | isbn =0807608866 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last =Matisse | first =Henri | title =Jazz | publisher =Prestel Publishing | date =2001 | location =New York | pages =10 | isbn =379132392X }}</ref><br>

He moved to the hilltop of Vence in 1943, where he produced his first major cut-out project for his artist's book titled ''[[Jazz (Henri Matisse)|Jazz]]''. However, these cut-outs were conceived as designs for stencil prints to be looked at in the book, rather than as independent pictorial works. At this point, Matisse still thought of the cut-outs as separate from his principal art form. His new understanding of this medium unfolds with the 1946 introduction for ''Jazz''. After summarizing his career, Matisse refers to the possibilities the cut-out technique offers, insisting "An artist must never be a prisoner of himself, prisoner of a style, prisoner of a reputation, prisoner of success…"<ref name="Elderfield 1978 8"/><br>

	The number of independently conceived cut-outs steadily increased following ''Jazz,'' and eventually led to the creation of mural-size works, such as ''Oceania the Sky'' and ''Oceania the Sea'' of 1946. Under Matisse’s direction, Lydia Delectorskaya, his studio assistant, loosely pinned the silhouettes of birds, fish, and marine vegetation directly onto the walls of the room. His first cut-outs of this scale, the two Oceania pieces evoked a trip to Tahiti he made years before.<ref>{{Citation

===The Chapel and museum===

In 1948, Matisse began to prepare designs for the [[Chapelle du Rosaire de Vence]], which allowed him to expand this technique within a truly decorative context. The experience of designing the chapel windows, [[chasubles]], and tabernacle door—all planned using the cut-out method—had the effect of consolidating the medium as his primary focus. Finishing his last painting in 1951 (and final sculpture the year before), Matisse utilized the paper cut-out as his sole medium for expression up until his death.<ref>{{cite book

This project was the result of the close friendship between Matisse and Bourgeois, now Sister Jacques-Marie, despite him being an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Henri Matisse: Modernist Against the Grain|year=2009|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=9780271035123|author=Catherine Bock-Weiss|accessdate=26 May 2012|page=147|quote=Natural enough, since he was surrounded by priests and nuns during his later illnesses and while working on the Venice Chapel, even though he remained a convinced atheist.}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/29/arts/design/29jacques.html ''Sister Jacques-Marie Influence for Matisse's Rosary Chapel, Dies'', NY Times, 29 September 2005] Retrieved 27 July 2010</ref> They had met again in [[Vence]] and started the collaboration, a story related in her 1992 book ''Henri Matisse: La Chapelle de Vence'' and in the 2003 documentary "A Model for Matisse".<ref>[http://www.cmu.edu/cmnews/extra/030630_matisse.html French Professor Directs "Model for Matisse"], Carnegie Mellon Today, 30 June 2003. Retrieved 30 July 2007.</ref>

In 1952 he established a museum dedicated to his work, the [[Matisse Museum (Le Cateau)|Matisse Museum in Le Cateau]], and this museum is now the third-largest collection of Matisse works in France.

According to [[David Rockefeller]], Matisse's final work was the design for a [[stained-glass]] window installed at the [[Union Church of Pocantico Hills]] near the Rockefeller estate north of New York City. "It was his final artistic creation; the [[maquette]] was on the wall of his bedroom when he died in November of 1954", Rockefeller writes. Installation was completed in 1956.<ref>David Rockefeller, [http://www.hudsonvalley.org/historic-sites/union-church-pocantico-hills It is a pleasure to welcome you to the Union Church of Pocantico Hills], Union Church of Pocantico Hills website, accessed 30 July 2010</ref>

Matisse died of a heart attack at the age of 84 on 3 November 1954. He is interred in the cemetery of the Monastère Notre Dame de Cimiez, near Nice.<ref>{{cite book

==Portrayal in media and literature==
;Film dramatisations
* A film called ''Masterpiece'', about the artist and his relationship with Monique Bourgeois,<ref>{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Al Pacino to play Henri Matisse|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/feb/14/al-pacino-to-play-henri-matisse|accessdate=29 April 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 February 2011}}</ref> was proposed in 2011. [[Deepa Mehta]] intended to direct with [[Al Pacino]] to play Henri Matisse.
* Matisse was played by Yves-Antoine Spoto in the 2011 film ''[[Midnight in Paris]]''.

;Exhibition on Screen
* The Museum of Modern Art’s Matisse retrospective was part of the film series "Exhibition on Screen", which broadcasts productions to movie theaters.
* Although none of it is live, the film, "Matisse From MoMA and Tate Modern", combines high-definition footage of the galleries with commentary from curators, museum administrators and, through narration of words from the past, Matisse himself.
* "We want to show the exhibition as well as we possibly can to the audience who can’t get there", said director Phil Grabsky. Inspired by a similar "event cinema" produced by the Met, Mr. Grabsky started his series to simulate the experience of strolling through an art exhibit.<ref>{{cite news|last=Battaglia|first=Andy|title=Matisse’s Cut-Outs, Now Screening at a Theater Near You|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/matisses-cut-outs-now-screening-at-a-theater-near-you-1421025541|accessdate=7 April 2014|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=11 January 2015}}</ref>

;Literature
* The [[Ray Bradbury]] short story "[[The Vintage Bradbury|The Watchful Poker Chip of H. Matisse]]" contains an allusion to the artist painting an eye on a poker chip for an American man to use as a monocle.
* In [[Michael Ondaatje]]'s "[[Running in the Family (memoir)|Running in the Family]]", there is a section called 'Don't talk to me about Matisse'
