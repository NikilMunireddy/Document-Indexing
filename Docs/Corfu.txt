The island is bound up with the [[history of Greece]] from the beginnings of [[Greek mythology]]. Its Greek name, ''Kerkyra'' or ''[[Korkyra]]'', is related to two powerful water symbols: [[Poseidon]], god of the sea, and [[Asopus|Asopos]], an important Greek mainland river.<ref name="Greek Mythology">{{cite web |url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheKorkyra.html |title=Greek Mythology Encyclopedia |publisher=Theoi.com |date= |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref> According to myth, Poseidon fell in love with the beautiful nymph Korkyra, daughter of Asopus and river nymph [[Metope (mythology)|Metope]], and abducted her.<ref name="Greek Mythology"/> Poseidon brought Korkyra to the hitherto unnamed island and, in marital bliss, offered her name to the place: ''Korkyra'',<ref name="Greek Mythology"/> which gradually evolved to ''Kerkyra'' ([[Doric Greek|Doric]]).<ref name="History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website"/> Together, they had a child they called ''Phaiax'', after whom the inhabitants of the island were named ''[[Scheria|Phaiakes]]'', in [[Latin]] ''Phaeaciani''. Corfu's nickname is ''The island of the [[Phaeacians]]''.

The island's history is full of battles and conquests. Castles punctuating strategic locations across the island are a legacy of these struggles. Two of these castles enclose its capital, which is the only city in Greece to be surrounded in such a way. As a result, Corfu's capital has been officially declared a ''Kastropolis'' ("castle city") by the Greek government.<ref name="History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website">{{cite web|url=http://www.corfu.gr/en/history.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106230616/http://www.corfu.gr/en/history.htm |archivedate=6 January 2008|title=Corfu City Hall website|work=City of Corfu|quote=In literature, apart from the Homeric name Scheria, we meet various other names for the island, like Drepanë or Arpi, Makris, Cassopaea, Argos, Keravnia, Phaeacia, Corkyra or Kerkyra (in Doric), Gorgo or Gorgyra and much later the medieval names Corypho or Corfoi, because of the two characteristic rock-peaks of the Old Fortress of Corfu.}}</ref> From medieval times and into the 17th century, the island was recognised as a bulwark of the European States against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and became one of the most fortified places in Europe.<ref name="Keyssler1760">{{cite book|author=Johann Georg Keyssler|authorlink=Johann Georg Keyssler|title=Travels Through Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy, and Lorrain: Giving a True and Just Description of the Present State of Those Countries ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_oKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA54|accessdate=6 July 2013|year=1760|publisher=G.

==Geography==
[[File:Corfu topographic map-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of Corfu. Its satellite islands of [[Ereikousa]], [[Othoni]] and [[Mathraki]] counterclockwise NW, WNW and W respectively (with respect to the northern part of the island at the top of the map) and [[Paxoi]] and [[Antipaxoi]] on the SE side, are visible.]]

The northeastern edge of Corfu lies off the [[coast]] of [[Sarandë]], [[Albania]], separated by straits varying in width from {{convert|3|to|23|km|0|abbr=in}}. The southeast side of the island lies off the coast of [[Thesprotia]], Greece. The name "Corfu", an Italian version of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Κορυφώ (Koryphō), meaning "city of the peaks", derives from the Greek Κορυφαί (Koryphai) (crests or peaks), denoting the two peaks of ''Palaio Frourio''.<ref name="History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website"/> Its shape resembles a [[sickle]] (''drepanē, δρεπάνι''), to which it was compared by the ancients: the concave side, with the city and harbour of Corfu in the centre, lies toward the Albanian coast. With the island's area estimated at {{convert|588|km2|0|abbr=on}}, it runs approximately {{convert|64|km|abbr=on}} long, with greatest breadth at around {{convert|32|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Two high and well-defined ranges divide the island into three districts, of which the northern is mountainous, the central undulating, and the southern low-lying. The more important of the two ranges, that of [[Mount Pantokrator|Pantokrator]] (Παντοκράτωρ – the Almighty) stretches east and west from Cape Falacro to Cape Psaromita, and attains its greatest elevation in the summit of the same name.

[[File:Aghios Georgios Bay in Corfu.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Bay of [[Agios Georgios, Corfu|Agios Georgios]] in northwestern Corfu]]

The second range culminates in the mountain of Santi Jeca, or Santa Decca, as it is called by misinterpretation of the Greek designation ''Άγιοι Δέκα'' (Hagioi Deka), or the Ten Saints. The whole island, composed as it is of various limestone formations, presents great diversity of surface, and views from more elevated spots are magnificent. Beaches are found in Agios Gordis, the [[Korission lagoon]], Agios Georgios, Marathia, Kassiopi, Sidari, Palaiokastritsa and many others. Corfu is located near the [[Kefalonia]] geological fault formation; earthquakes have occurred. Much of  Corfu city and the countryside preserve 16th century architecture.

Corfu's coastline spans {{convert|217|km|mi|0}} including capes; its highest point is [[Mount Pantokrator]] ({{convert|911|m|ft|0}}); and the second Stravoskiadi, at {{convert|849|m|ft|0}}. The full extent of capes and promontories take in Agia Aikaterini, Drastis to the north, Lefkimmi and Asprokavos to the southeast, and Megachoro to the south. Two islands are also to be found at a middle point of Gouvia and Corfu Bay, which extends across much of the eastern shore of the island; are known as Lazareto and Ptychia (or Vido). Camping areas can be found in [[Palaiokastritsa]], [[Agrillia]], with four in the northern part, [[Pyrgi]], [[Roda, Corfu|Roda]], [[Gouvia]] and [[Messonghi]].

===Othonoi and Ereikoussa===
[[Othonoi]] (Οθωνοί) is the westernmost settlement and island in all Greece; [[Ereikoussa]] is the northernmost of the Ionian Islands.

===Lazaretto Island===
[[File:Lazaretto island (Corfu).jpg|thumb|220px|[[Lazaretto Island]]]]

[[Lazaretto island (Corfu)|Lazaretto Island]], formerly known as Aghios Dimitrios, is located two nautical miles northeast of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]]; the island has an area of 17.5 [[acres]] and comes under the administration of the Greek National Tourist Organization. During Venetian rule in the early 16th century, a monastery was built on the islet and a leprosarium established later in the century, after which the island was named. In 1798, during the French occupation, the islet was occupied by the [[Russia|Russo]]-Turkish fleet, who ran it as a military hospital. During the British occupation, in 1814, the leprosarium was once again opened after renovations, and following Enosis in 1864 the leprosarium again saw occasional use.<ref name="koine"/> During [[World War II]], the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] established a [[Nazi concentration camp]] there for the prisoners of the [[Greek Resistance|Greek Resistance movement]],<ref name="Travel to Corfu"/> while remaining today are the two-storied building that served as the Headquarters of the Italian army, a small church, and the wall against which those condemned to death were shot.<ref name="koine">{{cite web|url=http://koine.terapad.com/index.cfm?fa=contentNews.newsDetails&newsID=10608&from=list|title=Corfu honored with a new museum |publisher=Koine.terapad.com|accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="Travel to Corfu">{{cite web|url=http://www.travel-to-corfu.com/page.php?id=46&back=corfu.php|title=Travel to Corfu |publisher=Travel to Corfu|accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>

===Flora===

[[Homer]] identifies seven plants that adorn the garden of [[Alcinous]]: wild olive, pear, [[pomegranate]], apple, [[ficus|fig]] and [[Vitis vinifera|grape vine]]. Of these the apple and the pear are ({{As of|2011|lc=y}}) very inferior{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} in Corfu; the others thrive, together with all the fruit trees known in southern Europe, with addition of the [[kumquat]], [[loquat]] and [[opuntia|prickly pear]] and, in some spots, the banana. When undisturbed by cultivation, the [[Myrtus|myrtle]], [[arbutus]], [[bay leaf|bay]] and [[holm oak]] form a rich brushwood, along with [[fir]] and [[Quercus cerris|Turkey oak]] in the hills. The minor flora of the island are extensive.

===Climate===
Corfu has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'' in the [[Koeppen climate classification]]).

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Dionysos Vacchos pediment at the Museum of Corfu.JPG|thumb|240px|A relief of [[Dionysus]] Bacchus at the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]].]]

The earliest reference to Corfu is the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean Greek]] word ''ko-ro-ku-ra-i-jo (''"man from Kerkyra") written in [[Linear B]] syllabic script, c. 1300 BC.<ref>[http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&wid=493 Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languages]</ref> According to [[Strabo]] Corcyra (Κόρκυρα) was the [[Homer]]ic island of [[Scheria]] (Σχερία),<ref name=Strabo>''Strab. vi. p. 407''</ref> and its earliest inhabitants were the [[Phaeacians]] (Φαίακες). The island has indeed been identified by some scholars with Scheria, the island of the Phaeacians described in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', though conclusive and irrefutable evidence for this theory or for [[Homer's Ithaca|Ithaca]]'s location have not been found. [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] depicts the island in ''[[Argonautica]]'' as a place visited by the Argonauts. [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] were married there in 'Medea's Cave'. Apollonius named the island ''Drepane'', Greek for "sickle", since it was thought to hide the sickle that [[Cronus]] used to castrate his father [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]], from whose blood the Phaeacians were descended. In an alternative account, Apollonius identifies the buried sickle as a scythe belonging to [[Demeter]], yet the name ''Drepane'' probably originated in the sickle-shape of the island. According to a [[scholiast]], commenting on the passage in ''Argonautica'', the island was first of all called [[Macris]] after the nurse of [[Dionysus]] who fled there from [[Euboea]].<ref>W.H. Race, ''Apollonius Rhodius: Argonautica'', Loeb Classical Library (2008), p. 409 n. 125–27; verses 4.982–992</ref>

Other have asserted that Corfu was ''[[Taphos]]'', the island of the [[Leleges|lelegian]] Taphians.<ref name="Goekoop2010">{{cite book|author=Cees H. Goekoop|title=Where on Earth Is Ithaca?: A Quest for the Homeland of Odysseus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=weJTNoX5TkQC&pg=PA85|accessdate=11 November 2012|date=15 September 2010|publisher=Eburon Uitgeverij B.V.|isbn=978-90-5972-344-3|page=85}}</ref>

At a date no doubt previous to the foundation of [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]], Corfu was peopled by settlers from [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], probably 730 BC, but it appears to have previously received a stream of emigrants from [[Eretria]]. The commercially advantageous location of Corcyra on the way between Greece and [[Magna Grecia]], and its fertile lowlands in the southern section of the island favoured its growth and, influenced perhaps by the presence of non-Corinthian settlers, its people, quite contrary to the usual practice of Corinthian colonies, maintained an independent and even hostile attitude towards the mother city.
[[File:Temple at Kardaki in Corfu.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The ruins of the Temple at Kardaki, built about 700 BC]]

This opposition came to a head in the early part of the 7th century BC, when their fleets fought the first naval battle recorded in Greek history: 665 BC according to [[Thucydides]]. These hostilities ended in the conquest of Corcyra by the Corinthian tyrant [[Periander]] (Περίανδρος) who induced his new subjects to join in the colonization of [[Apollonia, Illyria|Apollonia]] and [[Anactorium]]. The island soon regained its independence and thenceforth devoted itself to a purely mercantile policy. During the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] invasion of 480 BC it manned the second largest Greek fleet (60 ships), but took no active part in the war. In 435 BC it was again involved in a quarrel with [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]] over the control of [[Epidamnus]], and sought assistance from Athens (see [[Battle of Sybota]]).

This new alliance was one of the chief immediate causes of the [[Peloponnesian War]], in which Corcyra was of considerable use to the [[Athens|Athenians]] as a naval station, but did not render much assistance with its fleet. The island was nearly lost to Athens by two attempts of the oligarchic faction to effect a revolution; on each occasion the popular party ultimately won the day and took a most bloody revenge on its opponents (427 BC and 425 BC).<ref>Thucydides. "The Revolution in Corcyra." c. 400 BCE. Reprinted in Rogers, Perry. ''Aspects of Western Civilization.'' pp. 76–78. Pearson: Upper Saddle River. 2011.</ref>
[[File:Lion of Menekrates at the Corfu Museum.jpg|thumb|240px|The ''lion of Menekrates'' at the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]]]]

During the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] campaigns of Athens Corcyra served as a supply base; after a third abortive rising of the oligarchs in 410 BC it practically withdrew from the war. In 375 BC it again joined the Athenian alliance; two years later it was besieged by a [[Sparta]]n force, but in spite of the devastation of its flourishing countryside held out successfully until relieved. In the [[Hellenistic]] period Corcyra was exposed to attack from several sides.

In 303 BC, after a vain siege by [[Cassander]], the island was occupied for a short time by the [[Lacedaemonian]] general [[Cleonymus of Sparta]], then regained its independence and later it was attacked and conquered by [[Agathocles]]. He offered Corfu as dowry to his daughter [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]] on her marriage to [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], King of [[Epirus]]. The island then became a member of the Epirotic alliance. It was then perhaps that the settlement of [[Cassiope(city)|Cassiope]] was founded to serve as a base for the King of Epirus' expeditions. The island remained in the Epirotic alliance until 255 BC when it became independent after the death of [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]], last King of Epirus. In 229 BC, following the naval [[battle of Paxos]], it was captured by the [[Illyrians]], but was speedily delivered by a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] fleet and remained a Roman naval station until at least 189 BC. At this time, it was governed by a prefect (presumably nominated by the consuls), but in 148 BC it was attached to the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].<ref>''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, Oxford: 1992.</ref> In 31 BC, it served [[Augustus Caesar|Octavian]] (Augustus) as a base against [[Mark Antony]]. From AD 336 onwards, it was ruled by the Eastern Roman Empire. After the definitive division of the Roman Empire in AD 395, Kerkyra remained with the Eastern Roman Empire, known in modern historiography as the [[Byzantine Empire]].

===Medieval history===
[[File:Pondikonissi Island 05-06-06.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pontikonisi]] island is home of the monastery of ''Pantokrator'' (Μοναστήρι του Παντοκράτορος). The white staircase of the monastery resembles from afar a (mouse) tail. The island got its name from this architectural (perceptual) quirk: Mouse island.]]

Eclipsed by the foundation of [[Nicopolis]], Kerkyra for a long time passed out of notice. With the rise of the [[Normans|Norman]] kingdom in Sicily and the Italian naval powers, it again became a frequent object of attack. In 1081–1085 it was held by [[Robert Guiscard]], in 1147–1154 by [[Roger II of Sicily]].

During the break-up of the [[Byzantine Empire]] the island was occupied by [[Genoa|Genoese]] privateers (1197–1207), who in turn were expelled by the Venetians. In 1214 it passed to the Greek [[despotate of Epirus|despots of Epirus]], who gave it to [[Manfred of Sicily]] as a dowry in 1259.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Runciman|first1=Steven|title=The Sicilian Vespers|date=1958|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1-107-60474-2|page=43}}</ref> At his death in 1267 it passed with his other possessions to the [[Capetian House of Anjou|house of Anjou]]. Under the latter, the island suffered considerably from the inroads of various adventurers.

The island was one of the first places in Europe in which [[Romani people]] ("Gypsies") settled. In about 1360, a [[fiefdom]], called the ''[[Feudum Acinganorum]]'' was established, with mainly Romani [[serf]]s.<ref>''Bright Balkan morning: Romani lives & the power of music in Greek Macedonia,'' Charles Keil et al., 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=rPxA6JA49B4C&pg=PA108&dq=%22Feudum+Acinganorum%22&hl=en&ei=bXJWTbyIH9C74gbYgq3xBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Feudum%20Acinganorum%22&f=false p.108]</ref><ref>The Gypsies, Angus M.

From 1386, Corfu was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]], which in 1401 acquired formal sovereignty and retained it until the French Occupation of 1797.

A series of attempts by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] to take the island began in 1431 when Ottoman troops under Ali Bey landed on the island. The Ottomans tried to take the city castle and raided the surrounding area, but were repulsed.<ref name="History of Corfu">{{cite web|url=http://www.corfuweb.gr/gb-history6.htm |title=History of Corfu |publisher=Corfuweb.gr |date= |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>

The [[Siege of Corfu (1537)]] was the first great siege by the Ottomans. It began on 29 August 1537, with 25,000 soldiers from the Ottoman fleet landing and pillaging the island and taking 20,000 hostages as slaves. Despite the destruction wrought on the countryside, the city castle held out in spite of repeated attempts over twelve days to take it, and the Turks left the island unsuccessfully because of poor logistics and an epidemic that decimated their ranks.<ref name="History of Corfu"/>

Thirty-four years later, in August 1571, Ottoman forces returned for yet another attempt to conquer the island. Having seized [[Parga]] and [[Mourtos]] from the Greek mainland side, they attacked the Paxi islands. Subsequently they landed on Corfu's southeast shore and established a large beachhead all the way from the southern tip of the island at Lefkimi to Ipsos in Corfu's eastern midsection. These areas were thoroughly pillaged as in past encounters. Nevertheless the city castle stood firm again, a testament to Corfiot-Venetian steadfastness as well as the Venetian castle-building engineering skills. It is also worth mentioning that another castle, [[Angelokastro (Corfu)|Angelokastro]] (Greek: Αγγελόκαστρο meaning ''Angelo's Castle'' and named for its Byzantine owner Angelos Komnenos), situated on the northwest coast near [[Palaiokastritsa]] (Greek: Παλαιοκαστρίτσα meaning ''Old Castle place'') and located on particularly steep and rocky terrain, a tourist attraction today, also held out.<ref name="History of Corfu"/>
 
These defeats in the east and the west of the island proved decisive, and the Ottomans abandoned their siege and departed. Two years later they repeated their attempt. Coming from Africa after a victorious campaign, they landed in Corfu and wreaked havoc on rural areas. Following a counterattack by the Venetian-Corfiot forces, the Ottoman troops were forced to leave the city by way of the sea.<ref name="History of Corfu"/>

[[File:Gardiki Castle.jpg|thumb||240px|Outer perimeter of the [[Gardiki Castle, Corfu|Gardiki Castle]] which provided defence to the southern part of the island.]]

The [[Siege of Corfu (1716)|second great siege]] of Corfu took place in 1716, during the last [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–18)]]. After the conquest of the Peloponnese in 1715, the Ottoman fleet appeared in [[Buthrotum]] opposite Corfu. On 8 July the Ottoman fleet, carrying 33,000 men, sailed to Corfu from Buthrotum and established a beachhead at Ipsos.<ref name="History of Corfu"/> The same day, the Venetian fleet encountered the Ottoman fleet off the channel of Corfu and defeated it in the ensuing naval battle. On 19 July, after taking a few outlying forts, the Ottoman army reached the hills around the city of Corfu and laid siege to it. Despite repeated assaults and heavy fighting, the Ottomans were unable to breach the defences and were forced to raise the siege after 22 days. The 5,000 Venetians and foreign mercenaries, together with 3,000 Corfiotes, under the leadership of Count [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|von der Schulenburg]] who commanded the defence of the island, were victorious once more.<ref name="History of Corfu from Corfu City Hall website"/><ref name="History of Corfu"/><ref name="History of Corfu from xenos website">[http://web.archive.org/web/20070814153129/http://www.corfuxenos.gr/History/venetian.htm History of Corfu from xenos website]</ref> The success was owed in no small part to the extensive fortifications, where Venetian castle engineering had proven itself once again against considerable odds.

====Venetian policies and heritage====
[[File:Venetian blazon in Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|Venetian [[blazon]] with the [[Lion of Saint Mark]], as frequently found on the [[New Fortress]] walls.]]
[[File:Παλιό Φρούριο και Παλιά Πόλη από το Νέο Φρούριο.JPG|thumb|220px|Panoramic view of [[Corfu (city)]] from the New Fortress.]]

Corfu's urban architecture differs from that of other major Greek cities, because of Corfu's unique history. From 1386 to 1797, Corfu was ruled by Venetian nobility; much of the city reflects this era when the island belonged to the [[Republic of Venice]], with multi-storied buildings on narrow lanes. The Old Town of Corfu has clear Venetian influence and is amongst the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|World Heritage Sites in Greece]]. It was in Venetian period that the city saw the erection of the first opera house ([[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]]) in Greece, but it was badly damaged during World War II by German artillery.

Many Venetian-speaking families settled in Corfu during these centuries; they were called [[Corfiot Italians]], and until the second half of the 20th century the ''[[Venetian language|Veneto da mar]]'' was spoken in Corfu. During this time, the local Greek language assimilated a large number of Italian and Venetian words, many of which are still common today. The internationally renowned Venetian-born British photographer [[Felice Beato]] is thought to have spent much of his childhood in Corfu. Also many [[Italian Jews]] took refuge in Corfu during the Venetian centuries and spoke their own language ([[Italkian]]), a mixture of Hebrew-Italian in a Venetian or Apulian dialect with some Greek words.

Venetians promoted the [[Catholic Church]] during their four centuries of rule in Corfu. Today the majority of Corfiots are [[Greek Orthodox]], but the small Catholic minority (5%), living harmoniously with the Orthodox community, owes its faith to these origins. These contemporary Catholics are mostly families who came from [[Malta]], but also from [[Italy]], and today the Catholic community numbers about 4,000, (⅔ of Maltese descent) who live almost exclusively in the Venetian "Citadel" of [[Corfu City]]. Like other native Greek Catholics, they celebrate Easter using the same calendar as the [[Greek Orthodox]] church. The Cathedral of St. James and St. Christopher in Corfu City is the see of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Corfu, Zakynthos and Cephalonia]].

The island served also as a refuge for Greek scholars and in 1732 became the home of the first academy of modern Greece. A Corfu cleric and scholar, [[Nikephoros Theotokis]] (1732–1800) became renowned in Greece as an educator, and in Russia (where he moved later in his life) as an Orthodox archbishop.

The island's culture absorbed Venetian influence in a variety of ways; like other Ionian islands (see [[Cuisine of the Ionian islands]]), its local cuisine took in such elements and today's Corfiot cooking includes Venetian delicacies and recipes: "[[Pastitsada]]", deriving from the Venetian "Pastissada" (Italian: "Spezzatino") and the most popular dish in the island of Corfu, "[[Sofrito]]", "[[Strapatsada]]", "Savoro", "Bianco" and "Mandolato".

By the 1797 [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], Corfu was ceded to the [[French Revolution|French]], who occupied it for two years as the ''[[French departments of Greece|département]]'' of [[Corcyre]], until they were [[Siege of Corfu (1798–1799)|expelled]] by a joint [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n-Ottoman squadron under [[Admiral Ushakov]]. For a short time it became the capital of a self-governing federation of the [[Septinsular Republic|Heptanesos]] ("Seven Islands"), under Ottoman suzerainty; in 1807 after the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] its faction-ridden government was again replaced by a French administration under governor [[François-Xavier Donzelot]], and in 1809 it was besieged in vain by a British fleet, which had taken all the other Ionian islands. When, by the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]] of 5 November 1815, the Ionian Islands became a protectorate of the United Kingdom as the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]], Corfu became the seat of the British [[Lord High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands]]. The period of British rule was a prosperous period for Corfu because the [[Greek language]] became official, new roads were built, the water supply system was improved and the first Greek university was founded in 1824. On 29 March 1864, the United Kingdom, Greece, France and Russia signed the [[Treaty of London (1864)|Treaty of London]], pledging the transfer of sovereignty to Greece upon ratification. Thus, on 21 May, by proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, the Ionian Islands were united with Greece.<ref name="History of Corfu"/>

===First World War===
[[File:Serbs Corfu1916-1918.jpg|thumb|220px|Serbian soldiers in Corfu during WWI]]

During the [[First World War]], the island served as a refuge for the Serbian army that retreated there on [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] forces' ships from a homeland occupied by the Austrians, Germans and [[Bulgarians]]. During their stay, a large portion of Serbian soldiers died from exhaustion, food shortage, and various diseases. Most of their remains were buried at sea near the island of [[Vido]], a small island at the mouth of Corfu port, and a monument of thanks to the Greek nation has been erected at Vido by the grateful Serbs; consequently, the waters around Vido Island are known by the Serbian people as the [[Blue Graveyard]] (in Serbian, Плава Гробница, [[Plava Grobnica]]), after a poem written by [[Milutin Bojić]] following World War I.<ref name="Serbs in Corfu">

Upon the fall of [[Italian fascism]] in 1943, the Nazis moved to take control of the island. On 14 September 1943, Corfu was bombarded by the [[Luftwaffe]]; these bombing raids destroyed churches, homes, whole city blocks, especially in the Jewish quarter Evraiki, and a number of important buildings, such as the Ionian Parliament, the Municipal Theatre, the Municipal Library and others.<ref name="Corfu cityhall history page"/> The Italians capitulated, and the island came under German occupation.

===Post-war and modern Corfu===
After World War II and the [[Greek Civil War]], the island was rebuilt under the general programme of reconstruction of the Greek Government (Ανοικοδόμησις) and many elements of its classical architecture remain. Its economy grew but a portion of its inhabitants left the island for other parts of the country; buildings erected during Italian occupation – such as schools or government buildings – were put back to civic use.

==Urban landscape==

===Old town===
{{Main|Corfu (city)}}
{{wide image|Corfu Town R02.jpg|800px|Panoramic view of parts of Old Town of Corfu as seen from Old Fortress. The Bay of Garitsa is to the left and the port of Corfu is just visible on the top right of the picture. [[Spianada Square]] is in the foreground.}}

The city of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu]] stands on the broad part of a peninsula, whose termination in the Venetian [[citadel]] ({{lang-el|Παλαιό Φρούριο}}) is cut off from it by an artificial [[moat|fosse]] formed in a natural gully, with a seawater moat at the bottom, that now serves as a [[marina]] and is called the ''Contrafossa''. The old town, having grown within fortifications, where every metre of ground was precious, is a labyrinth of narrow streets paved with cobblestones, sometimes tortuous but colourful and clean. These streets are known as ''kantoúnia'' ({{lang-el|καντούνια}}), and the older amongst them sometimes follow the gentle irregularities of the ground; while many are too narrow for vehicular traffic. A promenade rises by the seashore towards the bay of Garitsa (Γαρίτσα), together with an esplanade between the city and the citadel known as ''Spianada'' with the {{ill|it|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|Liston}} arcade ({{lang-el|Λιστόν}}) to its west side, where restaurants and bistros abound.<ref name="Independent">[http://www.independent.co.uk/travel/holidays/family-holidays/the-complete-guide-to-corfu-851348.html The Independent] Complete Guide to Corfu</ref>

===Palaio Frourio===
{{main|Old Fortress, Corfu}}
[[File:Palaio Frourio in Corfu.png|thumb|240px|Palaio Frourio south elevation. The Venetian built [[moat]] is on the left and the Doric style St. George's Church built by the British can be seen in the background on the right.]]

The ''old citadel'' (in Greek ''Palaio Frourio'' (Παλαιό Φρούριο) is an old Venetian fortress built on an artificial islet with fortifications surrounding its entire perimeter, although some sections, particularly on the east side, are slowly being eroded and falling into the sea. Nonetheless, the interior has been restored and is in use for cultural events, such as concerts (συναυλίες) and Sound and Light Productions (Ηχος και Φως), when historical events are recreated using sound and light special effects. These events take place amidst the ancient fortifications, with the Ionian sea in the background. The central high point of the citadel rises like a giant natural [[obelisk]] complete with a military observation post at the top, with a giant [[#Early history|cross]] at its apex; at the foot of the observatory lies St. George's church, in a classical style punctuated by six [[Doric Order|Doric]] columns,<ref name="St. George">[http://www.igougo.com/planning/journalEntryActivity.asp?EntryID=27782 St. George Article]</ref> as opposed to the [[Hagia Sophia|Byzantine]] architectural style of the greater part of Greek Orthodox churches.

===Neo Frourio===
{{main|New Fortress, Corfu}}
[[File:Korfu Neue Festung (1).jpg|thumb|240px|View of the Neo Frourio]]

The ''new citadel'' or ''Neo Frourio'' (Νέο Φρούριο, "New Fortress") is a huge complex of fortifications dominating the northeastern part of the city. The huge walls of the fortress loom over the landscape as one travels from ''Neo Limani'' (Νέο Λιμάνι, "New Port") to the city, taking the road that passes through the fishmarket (ψαραγορά). The new citadel was until recently a restricted area due to the presence of a naval garrison, but old restrictions have been lifted and it is now open to the public, with tours possible through the maze of medieval corridors and fortifications. The winged [[Lion of St Mark]], the symbol of Venice, can be seen at regular intervals adorning the fortifications.

===Ano and Kato Plateia and the music pavilion===
Near the old Venetian Citadel a large square called ''Spianada'' is also to be found, divided by a street in two parts: "Ano Plateia" (literally: "Upper square") and "Kato Plateia" (literally: "Lower square"), (Ανω Πλατεία and Κάτω Πλατεία in Greek). This is the biggest square in South-Eastern Europe and one of the largest in Europe,<ref>[http://www.corfulife.co.uk/corfutown.html Corfu Life UK] Quote: "The French were the ones who turned the Spianada into a public square and park – one of the biggest in Europe"</ref><ref>[http://www.sognefk.no/viktige%20filer/BROCHURE%20OF%20KERKYRA%20CUP%20IN%20ENGLISH.pdf Brohure of Kerkyra] Quote: "SOCCER The tournament will start on Wednesday 04 of July An Open Ceremony and a parade of all the teams will take place in the biggest square in the Balkansand one of the most impressive ones in the whole continent, to the square Spianada itself which is constructed similarlyto the Royal Gardens of Europe."</ref> and replete with green spaces and interesting structures, such as a Roman-style rotunda from the era of British administration, known as the ''Maitland monument'', built to commemorate [[Sir Thomas Maitland]]. An ornate music pavilion is also present, where the local "Philharmonikes" (Philharmonic Orchestras) (Φιλαρμονικές), mount classical performances in the artistic and musical tradition for which the island is well known. "Kato Plateia" also serves as a venue where [[cricket]] matches are held from time to time. In Greece, cricket is unique to Corfu, as it was once a British protectorate.

===Palaia Anaktora and its gardens===
{{Main|Palace of St. Michael and St. George}}
[[File:Palaia Anaktora in Corfu.jpg|thumb|240px|View of the Palace of Saints Michael and George (Palaia Anaktora). The gates of St. Michael and St. George are on the left and right respectively.

[[File:Kipos tou Laou in Corfu.jpg|thumb|240px|The ''Garden of the People'' at the [[Palace of St. Michael and St. George]] (Palaia Anaktora) with the Ionian Sea in the background.]]

Just to the north of "Kato Plateia" lie the "Palaia Anaktora" (Παλαιά Ανάκτορα: literally "Old Palaces"): a large complex of buildings of Roman architectural style which formerly housed the Kings of Greece, and prior to that the [[List of Lord High Commissioners of the Ionian Islands|British Governors]] of the island. It was then called the Palace of Saints Michael and George. The [[Order of St. Michael and St. George]] was founded here in 1818 with motto ''auspicium melioris aevi'',<ref name="Stamatopoulos1993a">{{cite book|author=Nondas Stamatopoulos|title=Old Corfu: history and culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6m0-AQAAIAAJ|year=1993|publisher=N.

Today the palace is open to the public and forms a complex of halls and buildings housing art exhibits, including a [[Museum of Asian Art (Corfu)|Museum of Asian Art]], unique across Southern Europe in its scope and in the richness of its Chinese and Asian exhibits. The gardens of the Palaces, complete with old Venetian stone aquariums, exotic trees and flowers, overlook the bay through old Venetian fortifications and turrets, and the local sea baths (Μπάνια τ' Αλέκου) are at the foot of the fortifications surrounding the gardens. A café on the grounds includes its own [[art gallery]], with exhibitions of both local and international artists, known locally as the Art Café. From the same spot, the viewer can observe ships passing through the narrow channel of the historic [[Vido|Vido island]] (Νησί Βίδου) to the north, on their way to Corfu harbour (Νέο Λιμάνι), with high speed retractable [[aerofoil]] ferries from [[Igoumenitsa]] also cutting across the panorama. A wrought-iron aerial staircase, closed to visitors, descends to the sea from the gardens; the Greek royal family used it as a shortcut to the baths. Rewriting history, locals now refer to the old Royal Gardens as the "Garden of the People" (Ο Κήπος του Λαού).

===The Old Town and Pontikonisi===
The Old Town of [[Corfu (city)|Corfu city]] is an [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. In several parts of the old city, buildings of the [[Venice|Venetian]] era are to be found. The old city's architectural character is strongly influenced by the Venetian style, coming as it did under Venetian rule for a long period; its small and ancient sidestreets, and the old buildings' trademark arches are particularly reminiscent of [[Venice]]. Of the thirty-seven Greek churches, the most important are the city's cathedral, the church dedicated to Our Lady of the Cave (η Παναγία Σπηλιώτισσα (hē Panagia Spēliōtissa)); [[Saint Spyridon]] church, wherein lies the preserved body of the patron saint of the island; and finally the suburban church of St Jason and St Sosipater (Αγιοι Ιάσων και Σωσίπατρος), reputedly the oldest in the island, and named after the two saints probably the first to preach Christianity to the Corfiots.

The nearby island, known as [[Pontikonisi]] (Greek meaning "mouse island"), though small is very green with abundant trees, and at its highest natural elevation (excluding its trees or man-made structures, such as the monastery), stands at about {{convert|2|m|2|abbr=on}}. Pontikonisi is home of the monastery of Pantokrator (Μοναστήρι του Παντοκράτορος); the white stone staircase of the monastery, viewed from afar, gives the impression of a (mouse) tail, which lent the island its name.

==Archaeology and architecture==

===An architectural overview: From classical to modern===
[[File:Corfu Harbor 1890.jpg|thumb|The harbour of Corfu in 1890]]

Corfu contains a few very important remains of [[Ancient history|antiquity]]. The site of the ancient city of Corcyra (Kerkyra) is well ascertained, about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|0}} to the south-east of Corfu, upon the narrow piece of ground between the sea-lake of [[Halikiopoulo]] and the Bay of Castrades, in each of which it had a port. The circular tomb of [[Menekrates]], with its well-known inscription, is on the Bay of Castrades. Under the hill of Ascension are the remains of a temple, popularly called of [[Poseidon]], a very simple [[dome]] structure, which still in its mutilated state presents some peculiarities of architecture. In regard of [[Cassiope]], the only other city of ancient importance, its name is still preserved by the village of Cassiopi, and there are some rude remains of building on the site; but the temple of [[Zeus]] Cassius for which it was celebrated has totally disappeared. Throughout the island numerous monasteries and other buildings of Venetian erection are to be found, of which the best known are Paleokastritsa, San Salvador and Peleka. The ''Achilleion'' is a palace commissioned by [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth of Austria]] and purchased in 1907 by [[Wilhelm II of Germany]]; it is now a popular [[tourist attraction]].

===Italianate architecture===
[[File:Corfu city by the sea.jpg|thumb|300px|Old Corfu town as seen from the sea]]

[[Corfu (city)|Corfu city]] is famous for its [[Italianate architecture]], most notably the Liston, an arched colonnade lined with cafes on the edge of the ''Spianada'' (Esplanade), the vast main plaza and park which incorporates a [[cricket]] field and several pavilions. Also notable are the Venetian-Roman style City Hall, the Old and New castles, the recently restored Palace of Sts. Michael and George, formerly the residence of the British governor and the seat of the [[Ionian Senate]], and the summer Palace of ''[[Mon Repos, Corfu|Mon Repos]]'', formerly the property of the Greek royal family and birthplace of the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. The Park of Mon Repos is adjacent to the Palaiopolis of Kerkyra, where excavations were conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service in collaboration with the University of Louvain-la-Neuve in Belgium, and Brown University in the United States.

Examples of the finds can be found in the Museum of the Palace of Mon Repos.<ref name="Artifacts">R. Winkes (editor), Kerkyra. Artifacts from the Palaiopolis, Providence 2004.</ref>

===Destruction of architecture during World War II===
During [[World War II]], the island was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]], resulting in the destruction of most of the city's buildings, including its market (αγορά) and Hotel Bella Venezia. The worst architectural losses of the Luftwaffe bombardment were the splendid buildings of the [[Ionian Academy]] (Ιόνιος Ακαδημία), and the Municipal Theatre (which in 1901 had replaced the ''Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo''). The [[Roman architecture|Roman style]] Theatre (Θέατρον) of the city was later replaced by a bland, modern box-style building. Discussions have been held at local governmental level about demolishing this modern building and replacing it with a replica of the old theatre. In contrast, the Ionian University reconstructed the Ionian Academy in its former style.

===The Achilleion===
{{Main|Achilleion (Corfu)}}
[[File:Closeup of Achilles thniskon in Corfu Achilleion autocorrected.JPG|thumb|240px|left|Statue of ''Achilleús Thnēskōn'' (''[[Achilles]] Dying'') in the gardens of the Achilleion.]]

Empress (German: ''[[Kaiserin]]'') of Austria [[Elisabeth of Bavaria]], also known as Sissi, was a woman entranced by beauty. She lost her only son, [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria]], when he committed murder-suicide in [[The Mayerling Incident]] of 1889. A year later, in 1890, she built a summer palace in the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city, with the powerful mythical hero [[Achilles]] as its central [[Theme (literature)|theme]].

[[File:Achilles in Corfu.jpg|thumb|220px|Achilles as guardian of the palace in the gardens of the Achilleion. He gazes northward, toward the city. The inscription in Greek reads: ΑΧΙΛΛΕΥΣ i.e. Achilles. It was commissioned by Kaiser Wilhelm II.]]

The palace, with the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] Greek statues that surround it, is a monument to [[Platonism|platonic]] [[romanticism]] as well as [[escapism]]. It was named ''[[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achílleion]]'' (Αχίλλειον) after the [[Homer]]ic hero Achilles. The structure is filled with paintings and statues of Achilles, both in the main hall and in the gardens, depicting the scenes of the [[Trojan War]].

The Imperial gardens on the hill look over the surrounding green hill crests and valleys and the [[Ionian sea]]. The centrepiece of the gardens is a marble statue on a high pedestal, of the mortally wounded Achilles ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Αχιλλεύς Θνήσκων, ''Achilleús Thnēskōn'', Achilles Dying) without [[hubris]] and wearing only a simple cloth and an ancient Greek [[hoplite]] helmet. This statue was carved by German sculptor [[Ernst Gustav Herter]].

The hero is presented devoid of rank or status, and seems notably human though heroic, as he is forever trying to pull [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]'s arrow from his heel. His classically depicted face is full of pain. He gazes skyward, as if to seek help from [[Twelve Olympians|Olympus]]. According to [[Greek mythology]], his mother [[Thetis]] was a goddess.

In 1898, Empress Sissi was assassinated at the age of 60 by an Italian anarchist, [[Luigi Lucheni]], in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. After her death, the palace was sold to the [[German Empire|German]] [[Kaiser]] [[William II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. 
In contrast, at the great staircase in the main hall is a giant painting of the triumphant Achilles full of [[hubris|pride]]. Dressed in full royal military regalia and erect on his racing chariot, he pulls the lifeless body of [[Hector of Troy]] in front of the stunned crowd watching helplessly from inside the walls of the Trojan citadel.

Following the Kaiser's purchase of the Achilleion, he invited archaeologist [[Reinhard Kekulé von Stradonitz]], a friend and advisor, to come to Corfu to advise him where to position the huge statue of Achilles which he commissioned. The famous salute to Achilles from the Kaiser, which had been inscribed at the statue's base, was also created by Kekulé. The inscription read:<ref name="Röhl1998">{{cite book|author=John C. G.

The Achilleion was subsequently acquired by the Greek state and has now been converted into a museum.

===Kaiser's Bridge===
[[File:Kaiser's Bridge in Corfu.jpg|thumb|240px|View of the Kaiser's bridge]]

German [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was also fond of taking holidays in Corfu. Having purchased the Achilleion in 1907 after Sissi's death, he appointed [[Carl Ludwig Sprenger]] as the botanical architect of the Palace, and also built a bridge later named by the locals after him—the "Kaiser's bridge" (Greek: η γέφυρα του Κάιζερ transliterated as: i yefyra tou Kaizer) -- to access the beach without traversing the road forming the island's main artery to the south. The bridge, arching over the road, spanned the distance between the lower gardens of Achilleion and the nearby beach; its remains, a monument to imperial vanity, are an important landmark on the highway. The bridge's central section was demolished by the [[Wehrmacht]] in 1944, during the German occupation of World War II, to allow for the passage of an enormous cannon, forming part of the Nazi defences in the southeastern coast of Corfu.<ref name="GilesFlamburiari1994">{{cite book|author1=Frank Giles|author2=Spiro Flamburiari|author3=Fritz Von der Schulenburg|title=Corfu: the garden isle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Evs-AQAAIAAJ&q=Kaiser%27s+Bridge+Corfu&dq=Kaiser%27s+Bridge+Corfu&hl=en&sa=X&ei=beeEUZH2JK3d4AO7pIGYBg&sqi=2&redir_esc=y|accessdate=4 May 2013|date=1 September 1994|page=109|publisher=J.

==Municipality==
[[File:Flag of Corfu.png|thumb|200px|The flag of the municipality]]

The present municipality of Corfu was formed in the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 15 former municipalities, which became municipal units:<ref name=Kallikratis/>

{{div col}}
* [[Agios Georgios, Corfu|Agios Georgios]]

{{div col end}}

===Province===
The province of Corfu ({{lang-el|Επαρχία Κέρκυρας}}) was one of the [[provinces of Greece|provinces]] of the Corfu Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipality Corfu.<ref name=census91>{{PDFlink|[http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00086.pdf Detailed census results 1991]|39&nbsp;MB}} {{el icon}} {{fr icon}}</ref> It was abolished in 2006.

==Education==
[[File:Ionian Academy in daylight 2.JPG|thumb|The [[Ionian Academy]] is the first academic institution of modern Greece. The building is now fully restored after the WWII Luftwaffe bombings.]]
[[File:Kapodistrias Home in Corfu.jpg|thumb|Ioannis Kapodistrias' ancestral home in Corfu town. Nowadays hosts the Translation Department of the [[Ionian University]]]]

Aside from being a leading centre for the [[Fine Arts]], Corfu is also the home of the [[Ionian Academy]], an institution carrying through and strengthening the tradition of Greek education while the rest of Greece was still under Ottoman rule.

It is also home to the [[Ionian University]], established in 1984, in recognition, by the administration of [[Andreas Papandreou]], of Corfu's contribution to [[Education in Greece]], as the seat of the first Greek university in modern times,<ref>[http://www.ionio.gr/central/en/history History of the University]</ref> the [[Ionian Academy]]. The academy was founded in 1824, forty years before the cession of the [[Ionian islands]] to [[Greece]], and just three years after [[Greek Revolution|Greece's Revolution]] of 1821.

===Student activism===
In the modern era, beginning with its massive student protests during World War II against fascist occupation, and continuing in the fight against the dictatorship of [[Georgios Papadopoulos]] (1967–1974), students in Corfu have played a vanguard role in protesting for [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and democracy in Greece, against both internal and external oppression. For Corfiotes a recent example of such heroism is that of geology student [[Kostas Georgakis]], who set himself ablaze in [[Genoa]], Italy on 19 September 1970, in a protest against the [[Greek military junta of 1967-1974]].

==Museums and libraries==

==Culture==

===Patron Saint Spyridon===
[[File:Carrer i campanar de l'església de sant Espiridó, Corfú.JPG|thumb|240px|The bell tower of the [[Saint Spyridon Church]] can be seen in the background among the busy ''kantounia'' of the city centre. On top of the stores are apartments with balconies. It is from these type of balconies that Corfiots throw ''botides'', clay pots, to celebrate the Resurrection during Easter festivities.]]

[[Saint Spyridon]] the Thaumaturgist (Miracle-worker, Θαυματουργός) is the [[patron saint]] (πολιούχος) of the city and the island. St. Spyridon is revered for the miracle of expelling the plague (πανώλη) from the island, among many other miracles attributed to him. It is believed by the faithful that on its way from the island the plague scratched one of the fortification stones of the old citadel to indicate its fury at being expelled; to St. Spyridon is also attributed the role of saving the island at the second great siege of Corfu of 1716.<ref name="Holland2012">{{cite book|author=Robert Holland|title=Blue-Water Empire: The British in the Mediterranean since 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8QRXc7pr9DQC&pg=PT506|date=26 January 2012|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-1-84614-555-1|page=506}}</ref><ref name="Freely2008">{{cite book|author=John Freely|title=The Ionian Islands: Corfu, Cephalonia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VIBAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44|date=30 April 2008|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-0-85771-828-0|page=44}}</ref> The legend says that the sight of St. Spyridon approaching Ottoman forces bearing a flaming torch in one hand and a cross in the other caused [[panic]].<ref name="History of Corfu"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Essential Corfu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38kVAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=AA Publishing|isbn=978-0-7495-0921-7|page=11|quote=A dreadful storm - coupled with the rumour that St Spyridon was threatening the Turkish army with a flaming torch - broke the Turks' ...}}</ref><ref name="Lor1978">{{cite book|author=Michael Pratt, Lor|title=Britain's Greek Empire: Reflections on the History of the Ionian Islands from the Fall of Byzantium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ekkAAAAYAAJ|year=1978|publisher=Rex Collings|isbn=978-0-86036-025-4|page=47|quote=refers to the 1716 siege, when Spyridon is meant to have frightened away the Turks; }}</ref> The legend also states that the Saint caused a tempest which was partly responsible for repulsing the Ottomans.<ref name="FacarosPauls2007">{{cite book|author1=Dana Facaros|author2=Michael Pauls|title=The Greek Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qaRK8RM3Z0cC&pg=PA450|year=2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-86011-325-3|page=450}}</ref> This victory over the Ottomans, therefore, was attributed not only to the leadership of Count [[Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg|Schulenburg]] who commanded the stubborn defence of the island against Ottoman forces, but also to the miraculous intervention of St. Spyridon. Venice honoured von der Schulenburg and the Corfiots for successfully defending the island. Recognizing St. Spyridon's role in the defence of the island Venice legislated the establishment of the litany (λιτανεία) of St Spyridon on 11 August as a commemoration of the miraculous event, inaugurating a tradition that continues to this day.<ref name="History of Corfu"/> In 1716 [[Antonio Vivaldi]], on commission by the republic of Venice, composed the [[oratorio]] [[Juditha triumphans]] to commemorate this great event. ''Juditha triumphans'' was first performed in November 1716 in [[Venice]] by the orchestra and choir of the [[Ospedale della Pietà]] and is described as Vivaldi's first great oratorio.<ref name="Baroque music">[http://www.baroquemusic.org/bqxvivaldi.html Baroque Music] ''As far as his theatrical activities were concerned, the end of 1716 was a high point for Vivaldi. In November, he managed to have the Ospedale della Pietà perform his first great oratorio, Juditha Triumphans devicta Holofernis barbaric {{sic}}. This work was an allegorical description of the victory of the Venetians (the Christians) over the Turks (the barbarians) in August 1716.''</ref>
Hence Spyridon is a very populair first name for Greek males born on the island and/or to islanders.

===Music and festivities===

====The Three City Philharmonics====
[[File:Corfu Marching Band.JPG|thumb|240px|A marching band from [[Austria]], a frequent visitor, through the Corfu landmark of {{ill|it|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|Liston}}. In the background the western arch of [[Palace of St. Michael and St. George]].]]

Corfiote musical tradition is significant. In the past, people would join in the singing of ''cantádes'' ({{lang-el|καντάδες}}) or [[serenade]]s), impromptu choral songs in two, three or four voices, usually accompanied by a guitar. Nowadays, in the face of rigours of a modern life from which Corfiote society has not been spared, ''cantádes'' (from the Italian verb ''cantare'', ''to sing'') are only performed by semi-professional or amateur singers, often as attractions for visitors.

'Bands' (Philharmonic societies, or ''Φιλαρμονικές''), which also provide free instruction in music, are still popular and continue to attract young recruits. There are nineteen such marching wind bands throughout the island. <br>Corfu city is home to the three most prestigious bands – in order of seniority:
* the [[Philharmonic Society of Corfu]] use dark blue uniforms with dark red accents, and blue and red helmet plumes. It is usually called the ''Old Philharmonic'' or simply the ''Paliá'' ("Old"). Founded 12 September 1840.
* the [[Nikolaos Mantzaros|Mantzaros]] Philharmonic Society use blue uniforms with blue and white helmet plumes. It is commonly called the ''Néa'' ("New"). Founded 25 October 1890.
* the [[John Capodistria|Capodistria]] Philharmonic Union use bright red and black uniforms and plumes. It is commonly called the ''Cónte Capodístria'' or simply the ''Cónte'' ("[[Count]]"). It is the juniormost of the three (founded 18 April 1980).
All three maintain two major bands each, the main marching bands that can field up to 200 musicians on grand occasions, and the 60-strong student ''bandinas'' meant for lighter fare and on-the-job training.

The bands give regular summer weekend promenade concerts at the Spianada Green [[gazebo|"''pálko''"]], and have a prominent part in the yearly Holy Week ceremonies. A considerable but mostly friendly rivalry between them persists, and each rigorously adhere to their respective repertoires. Every time one of these bands passes in front of the building housing another, they stop and give a musical "salute" to their rival. While this is officially a sign of respect, it is actually a challenge meant to show off to the rivals and impress them with a display of superior musicianship.

====Easter====
[[File:Music Pavilion in Corfu.jpg|thumb|240px|The Music Pavilion in [[Spianada Square]] (Ano Plateia) with Palaio Frourio in the background. The philharmonics use it regularly for their free concerts.]]

On [[Good Friday]], from the early afternoon onward, the bands of the three Philharmonic Societies, separated into squads, accompany the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaph processions]] of the city churches. Late in the afternoon, the squads come together to form one band in order to accompany the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaph procession]] of the cathedral, while the funeral marches that the bands play differ depending on the band; the Old Philharmonic play [[Albinoni]]'s ''Adagio'', the Mantzaros play [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''Marcia Funebre'' from [[Don Carlo]], and the Capodistria play [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s ''Funeral March'' and [[Angelo Mariani (conductor)|Mariani]]'s ''Sventura''.<ref name="Easter">[http://web.archive.org/web/20071214202647/http://www.corfu.gr/en/culture/easter.htm Corfu city hall website on Easter festivities]</ref>

On Holy Saturday morning, the three city bands again take part in the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaph processions]] of St. Spyridon Cathedral in procession with the Saint's relics.<ref name="Easter"/> At this point the bands play different funeral marches, with the Mantzaros playing [[Miccheli]]'s ''Calde Lacrime'', the Palia playing ''Marcia Funebre'' from [[Franco Faccio|Faccio]]'s ''[[Amleto]]'', and the Capodistria playing the ''Funeral March'' from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Beethoven)|Eroica]]''. This custom dates from the 19th century, when colonial administrators banned the participation of the British garrison band in the traditional Holy Friday funeral cortege. The defiant Corfiotes held the litany the following morning, and paraded the relics of St. Spyridon too, so that the administrators would not dare intervene.

The litany is followed by the celebration of the "Early Resurrection"; balconies in the old city are decked in bright red cloth, and Corfiotes throw down large clay pots (the ''bótides'', μπότηδες) full of water to smash on the street pavement, especially in wider areas of {{ill|it|Liston (square){{!}}Liston|Liston}} and in an organised fashion.<ref name="Easter"/> This is enacted in anticipation of the Resurrection of Jesus, which is to be celebrated that same night,<ref name="Easter"/> and to commemorate [[King David]]'s phrase: "''Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel''" ([[Psalm 2]]:9).

Once the ''bótides'' commotion is over, the three bands parade the clay-strewn streets playing the famous "''Graikoí''" festive march.<ref name="Band rivalry">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE1yagErUbQ As the Old Philharmonic concludes its marching in front of their building with a hearty rendition of the ''Graikoí'' March, the New Philharmonic appears and "salutes" their rivals with yet another rendition of the same march]</ref> This legendary march, the anthem of the island, was composed during Venetian rule, and its lyrics urged: "''Greeks, never fear, we are all enslaved: you to the Turks, we to the Venetians, but one day we shall all be free''". The Venetians were replaced by the French and the French by the British, and both the lyrics and the performance of the march were officially banned. The bands, however, defiantly played it on the Eve of Easter, as a token of the resurrection of the nation, and the tradition is honored to this day.

====Musical history====
[[File:Manzaro.jpeg|thumb|left|160px|[[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], major representative of the [[Ionian School (music)|Ionian School of music]]]]

While much of present-day Greece was under Ottoman rule, the Ionian Islands enjoyed a Golden Age in music and opera. Corfu was the capital city of a prized Venetian colony and it benefited from a unique musical and theatrical heritage. Then in the 19th century, as a [[Protectorate|British Protectorate]], Corfu developed a musical heritage of its own and which constitutes the nucleus of modern Greek musical history. Until the early 18th century, musical life took place in city and village squares, with performances of straight or musical comedies – known as Momaries or Bobaries. From 1720, Corfu became the possessor of the first theatre in post-1452 Greece. It was the Teatro San Giacomo (now the City Hall) named after the nearby Roman Catholic cathedral (completed in 1691).<ref>Corfu the Garden Isle, editor Frank Giles, John Murray 1994, ISBN 0-7195-5375-X</ref>

The island was also the center of the so-called [[Ionian School (music)|Ionian School of music]], the musical production of a group of Heptanesian composers, whose heyday was from the early 19th century till approximately the 1950s. It was the first school of classical music in Greece and it was a heavy influence for the later Greek music scene, after the [[Greek War of Independence|independence]].

====Teatro di San Giacomo====
{{Main|Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù}}
[[File:Kerkyra Dimarheio.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]] was the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece. Today it serves as the Corfu City Hall.]]

Under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian rule]], the Corfiotes developed a fervent appreciation of Italian opera, which was the real source of the extraordinary (given conditions in the mainland of [[Greece]]) musical development of the island during this era.<ref name="BirthofGreekopera">[http://www.donizettisociety.com/Articles/ArticleMantzaros/BirthofGreekopera.pdf Birth of Greek opera Paper] Kostas Kardamis "San Giacomo and Greek ottocento"XI Convegno Annuale di Società Italiana di Musicologia [[Lecce]], 22–24 October 2004</ref> The opera house of Corfu during 18th and 19th century was the [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù|Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo]], named after the neighbouring Catholic cathedral; it was later converted into the City Hall.<ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/> It was both the first theatre and first [[opera house]] of Greece in modern times and the place where the first Greek opera (based on an exclusively Greek [[libretto]]), [[Spyridon Xyndas]]' ''The Parliamentary Candidate'' was performed.<ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/> A long series of local composers, such as [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Antonio Liberali]], [[Domenico Padovani]], the [[Zante|Zakynthian]] [[Pavlos Carrer]], the [[Lambelet]] family, [[Spyridon Samaras]], and others, all developed careers intertwined with the theatre.<ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/> San Giacomo's place was taken by the Municipal Theatre in 1902, which maintained the operatic tradition vividly until its destruction during [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|German air raid]] in 1943.<ref name="BirthofGreekopera"/>

====Ionian University and musical tradition====
Since the early 1990s a music department has been established at the [[Ionian University]]. Aside from its academic activities, concerts in Corfu and abroad, and musicological research in the field of Neo-Hellenic Music, the Department organizes an international music academy every summer , which gathers together both international students and professors specialising in [[Brass instrument|brass]], [[strings (music)|strings]], singing, [[jazz]] and [[musicology]].

====Ta Karnavalia====
Another venerable Corfu tradition is known as the [[Carnival]] or ''Ta Karnavalia.''

Corfiotes have a long history of hospitality to foreign residents and visitors, typified in the 20th century by [[Gerald Durrell]]'s childhood reminiscence ''My Family and Other Animals''. The north east coast has largely been developed by a few British holiday companies, with large expensive holiday villas.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/greathomesanddestinations/11iht-recorfu.html | work=The New York Times | title=Overseas Buyers Fall for Corfu's Historic Charm | first=Nick | last=Foster | date=11 September 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> [[Package holiday]] resorts exist on the north, east and southwest coasts.

At the other end of the island, the southern resort of [[Kavos]] also provides tourist facilities.

St George South to the west boasts the largest sandy beach on the island coupled with a selection of all inclusive package hotels and traditional corfiot villas and flats. The Korission lake nature reserve also provides a stop over for European birds migrating south.

Up until the early 20th century, it was mainly visited by the European royals and elites, including Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] and [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria]]; today it is also widely visited by middle class families (primarily from the UK, [[Scandinavia]] and Germany). With the advent of the jet airliner bringing these groups relatively affordable 'package holidays', Corfu was one of the primary destinations for this new form of mass tourism.<ref>Paris Tsartas, Tourism Development in Greek Insular and Coastal Areas, 2003</ref> It is still popular with the global elite however, and in the island's northeast the homeowners include members of the [[Rothschild family]] and Russian oligarchs.<ref>[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/6c408b7a-94ef-11e0-a648-00144feab49a.html#axzz1Z61QKNGN Nick Foster, Financial Times, Ionian rhapsody June 17, 2011]</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/3330651/Corfu-is-all-about-fun-not-funds-Greek-Islands.html Daily Telegraph, November 3, 2008]</ref>

The island is linked by two motorways, GR-24 in the northwest and GR-25 in the south.

*Greek National Road 24, Cen., NW, Corfu – Palaiokastritsa
*Greek National Road 25, Cen., S, SE, Corfu – Lefkimi

Corfu has ferry services both by traditional ferries to Gaios in the island of [[Paxoi]] and as far as [[Patras]] and both traditional ferries and advanced retractable [[airfoil]], [[hydrodynamic]]-flow, high-speed ferries called "Flying Dolphins" to [[Igoumenitsa]] and [[Sarandë]] in neighbouring [[Albania]]. The small port of Lefkimmi is also to be found at the southernmost tip of the island on Cape Kavos, offering a [[ferry boat|ferry]] service to the mainland.

The [[Ioannis Kapodistrias International Airport]], named after [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], a distinguished Corfiot and European diplomat, and the first governor of the independent Greek state, is located around three kilometres south of Kerkyra, just half a kilometre north of Pontikonisi. The approach and landing, in a northeasterly direction, afford passengers spectacular aerial views of ''Pontikonisi'' and Vlaheraina Monastery, also taking in the hills of ''Kanoni'', as the runway employed for landing lies a few hundred metres from these spectacular local landmarks. The airport offers domestic flights from [[Olympic Airlines]] (OA 600, 602 and 606), and [[Aegean Airlines]] (A3 402, 404 and 406). Seaplanes, Air Sea Lines, a Greek seaplane operator, offers scheduled flights from Corfu to Paxoi, Lefkada, Ithaki, Kefalonia, [[Ioannina]], Patras and [[Brindisi]] in Italy.

The buses to the main places on the island run about six times a day between the city and Glyfada, Sidari, Paleokastritsa, Roda and Acharavi, Lefkimmi, Lefkimmi and Piri. Other coaches drive up to twice a day to Athens and Thessaloniki. City buses run through the city to the Airport, Achilleon, Gouvia, Afra, Pelekas and some other places of interest.

A [[bike-sharing]] scheme called EasyBike Brainbox is available to get around the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.easybike.gr/ |title=Easybike &#124; Σύστημα Μίσθωσης Ποδηλάτων &#124; Κοινόχρηστα Ποδήλατα &#124; BikeSharing |publisher=Easybike.gr |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

Also cultivated on the island are the white Petrokoritho, Moschato Aspro, Robola and Kozanitis and the red Kakotrygis and Mavrodafni |publisher=Greekwinemakers.com |date= |accessdate=29 June 2009}}</ref>

Modern times have seen the introduction of specialist cultivation supported by the mild climate, like the [[kumquat]] and [[bergamot orange]]s, which are extensively used in making [[spoon sweets]] and [[liqueur]]s. Corfu also produces local animal products, such as Corfiote ''graviéra'' (a variant of [[Gruyère (cheese)|gruyere]]) and "''Corfu''" cheese (a variant of [[Grana (cheese)|Grana]]); "Corfu butter" (''Boútyro Kerkýras''), an intensely flavored cooking and baking butter made of [[ewe's milk]]; and the ''noúmboulo'' [[salami]] made of pork and lard and flavored with orange peel, oregano, thyme and other aromatic herbs, which are also burned for smoking.

Local culinary specialties include ''[[sofrito]]'' (a [[veal]] rump roast of [[Venice|Venetian]] origin), ''pastitsáda'' ([[bucatini]] pasta served with diced veal cooked in a tomato sauce), ''bourdétto'' ([[cod]] cooked in a [[Capsicum|pepper]]y sauce), ''mándoles'' (caramelized [[almonds]]), ''pastéli'' ([[honey]] bars made with [[sesame]], [[almond]]s or [[pistacchio]]s), ''mandoláto'' (a "pastéli" made of crushed almonds, sugar, honey and [[vanilla]]), and ''tzitzibíra'', the local [[ginger beer]], a remnant of the British era.

The island has again become an important [[Port#port of call|port of call]] and has a considerable trade in olive oil. In earlier times there was a great export of [[Greek citron|citron]], which was cultivated here, including for ritual use in the Jewish community during the [[Sukkot]] holiday.
