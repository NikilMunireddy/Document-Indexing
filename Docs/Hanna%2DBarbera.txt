'''Hanna-Barbera Productions, Inc.''' (simply known as '''Hanna-Barbera''' and also referred to as '''H-B Enterprises''', '''H-B Production Company''' and '''Hanna-Barbera Cartoons''') was an American animation studio that dominated American television animation for 
three decades in the mid-to-late 20th century. It was founded in 1957 by former [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] animation directors [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] (creators of ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'') and live-action director [[George Sidney]] in partnership with [[Screen Gems]], television arm of [[Columbia Pictures]].<ref name="HannaRuffReddy" /> Sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]] in late 1966, it spent the next two decades as its subsidiary. 

Hanna-Barbera was not only known for its variety of characters, but for building upon and popularizing the concepts and uses of [[limited animation]]. For 30 years, many successful cartoons were produced, including ''[[The Flintstones]]'', ''[[The Yogi Bear Show|Yogi Bear]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?|Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]''. <!--DO NOT add more shows to this list. Five series that spawned multiple spin-offs is enough--> In addition to winning seven [[Academy Award]]s, Hanna and Barbera won eight [[Emmy Award]]s,<ref name="AMawards">{{cite web| url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=2:93352~T3|title=William Hanna&nbsp;– Awards|publisher=[[allmovie]]|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}</ref> a [[Golden Globe Award]], a [[Humanitas Prize]] and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], among other merits. After its fortunes declined in the mid-eighties when the profitability of [[Saturday morning cartoons]] was eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication, it was purchased from Taft (by then named '''Great American Broadcasting''') in late 1991 by [[Turner Broadcasting System]], who used much of its back catalog to program its new channel, [[Cartoon Network]].<ref>{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; Hanna-Barbera Sale Is Weighed|work=The New York Times|date=July 20, 1991|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/20/business/company-news-hanna-barbera-sale-is-weighed.html?scp=9&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; A New Life For Cartoons|work=The New York Times|date=February 19, 1992|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/19/business/the-media-business-turner-broadcasting-plans-to-start-a-cartoon-channel.html?scp=24&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2010 |first=Bill |last=Carter}}</ref> After Turner purchased the company, both Hanna and Barbera continued to serve as mentors and creative consultants. 

Turner merged with [[Time Warner]] in 1996 and the studio became a subsidiary of [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. With Hanna's death in 2001, it was absorbed into its parent, and [[Cartoon Network Studios]] continued the projects for the channel's output. Barbera continued to work for Warner Bros. Animation until his death in 2006. The studio now exists as an in-name-only company used to market properties and productions associated with the Hanna-Barbera library, specifically its "classic" works. In 2005, the [[Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]] honored Hanna and Barbera with a bronze wall sculpture of them and the characters they created.

==History==

[[Melrose, New Mexico]] native [[William Hanna]] and [[New York City]]-born [[Joseph Barbera]] first met while working at the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio]] in 1939. Their first directorial production was the [[Academy Award]]-nominated ''[[Puss Gets the Boot]]'' (1940), which served as the basis for the popular ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' series of short subject theatricals. Hanna and Barbera served as directors and story men of the shorts for over 18 years and Hanna himself provided the screams, yelps and yells for [[Tom Cat|Tom]]. Seven of the cartoons won the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]] between 1943 and 1953, though the trophies were awarded to their producer [[Fred Quimby]], who was not involved in the creative development of the shorts.<ref name="BarberaAutoBio">{{cite book|last=Barbera|first=Joseph|title=My Life in "Toons": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|year=1994|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|isbn= 1-57036-042-1|page=207}}</ref>{{rp|83–84}} With Quimby's retirement in 1955, Hanna and Barbera became the producers in charge of the MGM animation studio's output.<ref name="BarrierMGMclosing" />
Outside of their work on the cartoons, the two men moonlighted on outside projects, including the original title sequences and commercials for the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.<ref name="jbarberainterviewvideo">{{Cite video|people=[[Leonard Maltin]]|title=Interview with Joseph Barbera|medium=Digital|publisher=[[Archive of American Television]]|date=1997|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/joseph-barbera}}</ref>

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer decided in early 1957 to close its cartoon studio, as it felt it had acquired a reasonable backlog of shorts for re-release.<ref name="BarrierMGMclosing">Barrier, Michael (1999).

ISBN 0-19-516729-5.</ref> Hanna and Barbera, contemplating their future while completing the final ''Tom and Jerry'' and ''[[Droopy]]'' cartoons, began producing animated television commercials.<ref name="BarrierHBopening" /> During their last year at MGM, they developed a concept for an animated television program about a dog and cat pair in various misadventures.<ref name="BarrierHBopening" /> After they failed to convince to back their venture, live-action director [[George Sidney]], who'd worked with Hanna and Barbera on several of his features, most notably ''[[Anchors Aweigh (film)|Anchors Aweigh]]'' in 1945, offered to serve as their business partner and convinced [[Screen Gems]], the television subsidiary of [[Columbia Pictures]], to make a deal with the animation producers.<ref name="HannaRuffReddy" /> [[Harry Cohn]], head of Columbia Pictures, took an 18% ownership in Hanna and Barbera's new company, ''H-B Enterprises'',<ref name="HannaRuffReddy" /> and provided working capital to produce.

===Television cartoons: 1957–1969===
Hanna-Barbera was one of the first studios to successfully produce cartoons especially for television.<ref>{{cite news|title= Caveman to Carp: The Prime-Time Cartoon Devolves|work=The New York Times|date=February 23, 1992|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/23/movies/caveman-to-carp-the-prime-time-cartoon-devolves.html?scp=27&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2010 |first=Jan |last=Benzel}}</ref> Previously, animated programming on television had consisted primarily of rebroadcasts of theatrical cartoons. Their first animated series for television ''[[The Ruff and Reddy Show]]'', premiered on [[NBC]] in December 1957. Next, the studio had its first big hit with ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'' in 1958, a syndicated series aired in most markets just before primetime. A ratings success, it introduced a new crop of cartoon stars to audiences, in particular [[Huckleberry Hound]] and [[Yogi Bear]]. The show won an [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for Outstanding Achievement in the Field of Children's Programming. Beginning to expand rapidly following the success of the series, several animation industry alumni – in particular former [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] storymen [[Michael Maltese]] and [[Warren Foster]], who became Hanna-Barbera's new head writers – joined the staff at this time.<ref name="BarrierHBopening" /> By 1959, H-B Enterprises was reincorporated as ''Hanna-Barbera Productions'', and was slowly becoming a leader in television animation production.

After introducing both, a second syndicated cartoon, ''[[The Quick Draw McGraw Show]]'' and its first and only theatrical series, ''[[Loopy De Loop]]'', in 1959, Hanna-Barbera migrated into network primetime production with the animated [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in 1960. Loosely based upon the popular live-action [[Jackie Gleason]] series ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', yet set in a fictionalized stone age of cavemen and dinosaurs, the show ran for a total of six seasons, becoming a ratings and merchandising success. It was the longest-running animated show in American prime time television history until being beaten out by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in 1996. Hanna-Barbera's first spin-off series, ''[[The Yogi Bear Show]]'', first aired syndicated in 1961 and, during the early and mid-sixties, the studio produced more new successful primetime and syndicated shows such as ''[[Top Cat]]'', ''[[The Hanna-Barbera New Cartoon Series]]'' and ''[[The Jetsons]]''. More new animated shows of ''[[The Magilla Gorilla Show]]'', ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[The Peter Potamus Show]]'', ''[[The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show]]'', ''[[Sinbad Jr. and his Magic Belt]]'' and ''[[Laurel and Hardy (animated series)|Laurel and Hardy]]'' aired.

Several animated television commercials were produced and aired as well, often starring its own characters (notably, the best known ones is the long running series of [[Pebbles cereal|Fruity and Cocoa Pebbles cereal]] television ads for [[Post Foods]] featuring [[Barney Rubble]] going through a series of schemes and costumes to trick [[Fred Flintstone]] in to giving up his Fruity or Cocoa Pebbles cereal to him before it backfires and Fred then gives chase to Barney for taking his Pebbles), and animated the opening credits for the ABC sitcom ''[[Bewitched]]'', in which the animated caricatures of its characters Samantha and Darrin of that show's famous cartoon title would appear as guest stars in a season six episode of ''The Flintstones'', voiced by both [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and [[Dick York]] respectively. Meanwhile, the studio moved off of the Kling lot in 1963 (which by then had been renamed the [[Red Skelton]] Studios) into a new location at 3400 Cahuenga Blvd. West in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]].

[[File:HannaBarbera.JPG|thumb|left|The former Hanna-Barbera building at 3400 Cahuenga Blvd. West in [[Hollywood|Hollywood, California]], seen in a 2007 photograph. The small yellow structure (lower right) was originally the "guard shack" for the property entrance to the east of the building.]]
This California contemporary office building was designed by architect [[Arthur Froehlich]]. Its ultra-modern design included a sculpted latticework exterior, moat, fountains, and after later additions, a Jetsons-like tower. After the success of ''The Atom Ant/Secret Squirrel Show'' in 1965, two new Saturday morning series debuted the following year, ''[[Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles]]'', which blended action-adventure with the earlier Hanna-Barbera humor style and ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'', which featured action-adventure. A number of comedy and action cartoons followed in 1967, among them are ''[[The Space Kidettes]]'', ''[[The Abbott and Costello Cartoon Show]]'', ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]'', ''[[The Herculoids]]'', ''[[Shazzan]]'', an adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Fantastic Four (1967 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'', ''[[Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor]]'' and ''[[Samson & Goliath]]'' (also known as ''Young Samson'').

The Hanna-Barbera and Screen Gems partnership lasted until 1965, when Hanna and Barbera announced the sale of the studio to [[Taft Broadcasting]].<ref name="Rogers">Rogers, Lawrence H. (2000).

In 1968, a birth of new programs arose, such as ''[[The Banana Splits Adventure Hour]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Gulliver]]'' and ''[[The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', while the successful ''[[Wacky Races]]'', and its spinoffs ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' and ''[[Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines]]'', aired on CBS, returned Hanna-Barbera to straight slapstick humor, followed by ''[[Cattanooga Cats]]'' for ABC.

It featured the artists of [[Louis Prima]], [[Five Americans]], [[Scatman Crothers]] and the [[13th Floor Elevators]]. Previously, children's records with Yogi Bear and others were released by [[Colpix Records]].

The majority of American television animation was made by Hanna-Barbera{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and the only competition came from [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises|DePatie-Freleng]] and others that primarily specialize in prime time specials, such as [[Rankin-Bass]], [[Chuck Jones|Chuck Jones Enterprises]] and [[Lee Mendelson]]-[[Bill Meléndez]]. [[Filmation]] lost ground to Hanna-Barbera when the failure of its series ''[[Uncle Croc's Block]]'' led ABC president [[Fred Silverman]] to drop Filmation and give them the majority of the network's Saturday morning cartoon time.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Joe Ruby]] and [[Ken Spears]] left the studio to found [[Ruby-Spears]], with [[Filmways]] as its parent company in 1977. Taft bought [[Worldvision Enterprises]] in 1979, which would become the syndication distributor for most of Hanna and Barbera's cartoons. Hanna-Barbera tried its hand at producing in live-action, though its success selling such programming was limited by its track record as an animation studio, such as ''[[Korg: 70,000 B.C.]]'' and ''[[The Hanna-Barbera Happy Hour]]''. Perhaps the best known of the non-animated projects is the Emmy-winner, ''[[The Gathering (1977 film)|The Gathering]]'', starring [[Ed Asner]]. Its live-action unit spun off into Solow Production Company, which immediately following the name change, was able to sell the series ''[[Man from Atlantis]]'' to NBC.<ref name="STUEP3a">Shostak, Stu (12-20-2006).

===Production process changes===
[[File:Hanna-Barbera.svg|thumb|Early ''H-B Enterprises'' logo used from the studio's inception in 1957 until 1960.]]
Hanna-Barbera produced prime-time, weekday afternoon, and [[Saturday morning cartoons]] for all three major networks and syndication in the United States from 1957 to 1995. The small budgets that television animation producers had to work within prevented them, and most other producers of American television animation, from working with the full theatrical-quality animation the duo had been known for at MGM. While the budget for a seven-minute ''Tom and Jerry'' short was about $35,000, Hanna-Barbera was required to produce five-minute ''Ruff and Reddy'' episodes for no more than $3,000 a piece.<ref name="HannaRuffReddy">Hanna, William and Ito, Tom (1999). A Cast of Friends. New York: Da Capo Press. 0306-80917-6. Pg. 81–83</ref> To keep within these tighter budgets, Hanna-Barbera modified the concept of [[limited animation]] (also called semi-animation) practiced and popularized by the [[United Productions of America]] (UPA) studio, which also once had a partnership with Columbia Pictures. Character designs were simplified, and backgrounds and animation cycles (walks, runs, etc.) were regularly re-purposed.

Characters were often broken up into a handful of levels, so that only the parts of the body that needed to be moved at a given time (i.e. a mouth, an arm, a head) would be animated. The rest of the figure would remain on a held animation cel. This allowed a typical 10-minute short to be done with only 1,200 drawings instead of the usual 26,000. Dialogue, music, and sound effects were emphasized over action, leading [[Chuck Jones]]—a contemporary who worked for Hanna and Barbera's rivals at [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]] when the duo was at MGM, and one who, with his short ''[[The Dover Boys]]'' practically invented many of the concepts in limited animation—to disparagingly refer to the limited television cartoons produced by Hanna-Barbera and others as "illustrated radio".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Cartoons-THE-GOLDEN-ERA.html|title=The golden era - Cartoons - film, director, music|work=filmreference.com}}</ref> In a story published by ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' in 1961, critics stated that Hanna-Barbera was taking on more work than it could handle and was resorting to shortcuts only a television audience would tolerate.<ref name="SEP" /> An executive who worked for [[Walt Disney Productions]] said, "We don't even consider [them] competition".<ref name="SEP">(Dec. 2, 1961) "[http://dawsbutler.com/hb-article-web/hb-article-05.jpg TV'S Most Unexpected Hit – ''The Flintstones'']" ''The Saturday Evening Post''</ref>

Ironically, during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Hanna-Barbera was the only animation studio in Hollywood that was actively hiring, and it picked up a number of Disney artists who were laid off during this period. The studio's solution to the criticism over its quality was to go into features. The studio produced six theatrical features, among them higher-quality versions of its hit television cartoons and adaptations of other material. Hanna-Barbera was also the first animation studio to have their animation work produced overseas. One of these production companies was a subsidiary started by Hanna-Barbera called [[Fil-Cartoons]] in the [[Philippines]].<ref>{{cite news|title= TELEVISION; Peter Pan, Garfield and Bart – All Have Asian Roots|work=The New York Times|date=December 2, 1990|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/movies/television-peter-pan-garfield-and-bart-all-have-asian-roots.html?scp=45&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2010 |first=Barbara |last=Basler}}</ref> [[Wang Film Productions]] got its start as an overseas animation facility for Hanna-Barbera in 1978.<ref>http://taiwaninfo.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1281&CtNode=92&htx_TRCategory=&mp=4</ref>

===Rise and fall: 1981–1990===
Many competing animation studios, such as [[Sunbow Entertainment|Sunbow Productions]], Rankin-Bass, [[Marvel Productions]] and Filmation introduced successful syndicated cartoons based upon characters from popular toy lines and action figures.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Hanna-Barbera continued to produce for Saturday mornings and weekday afternoons but no longer dominated the television animation market as it did years earlier. In 1981, Taft purchased Ruby-Spears from Filmways, in which that studio would began to pair its variety of shows with the various Hanna-Barbera programs.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} 1980 saw the series debuts of ''[[Super Friends (1980 TV series)|Super Friends]]'', ''[[The Flintstone Comedy Show (1980)|The Flintstone Comedy Show]]'', ''[[The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]'' and ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]''. Brand new programs emerged in 1981, such as ''[[Laverne and Shirley in the Army|Laverne and Shirley]]'', ''[[Space Stars]]'', ''[[The Kwicky Koala Show]]'' and ''[[Trollkins]]''. 

Hanna-Barbera's most popular hit show ''[[The Smurfs (TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', based on [[The Smurfs|the comics and stories]] by Belgian cartoonist and creator [[Peyo|Pierre Culliford]] (known as Peyo) and centering on the society of little blue forest dwelling creatures led by [[Papa Smurf]], aired for nine seasons, becoming a big ratings success and the top-rated program in eight years. It was the longest-running Saturday-morning cartoon series and the highest for an NBC program since 1970.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Fresh new animated shows of ''[[Pac-Man (TV series)|Pac-Man]]'', ''[[The Little Rascals (animated TV series)|The Little Rascals]]'', ''[[The Scooby & Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour]]'', ''[[Jokebook]]'', ''[[Shirt Tales]]'' and ''[[The Gary Coleman Show]]'' first aired in 1982 while ''[[The Dukes (TV series)|The Dukes]]'', ''[[Monchhichis (TV series)|Monchhichis]]'', ''[[The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'', and ''[[The Biskitts]]'' came next in 1983. For 1984, ''The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries'', ''[[Snorks]]'', ''[[Challenge of the GoBots]]'', ''[[Pink Panther & Sons]]'', and ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]'' made their network and syndicated airings. 

In 1985, ''[[The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians]]'', ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', and the program block ''[[The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera]]'', which introduced ''[[Yogi's Treasure Hunt]]'', ''[[Paw Paws]]'', and ''[[Galtar and the Golden Lance]]'' premiered.

''[[Sky Commanders]]'', ''[[Popeye and Son]]'', ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Ed Grimley|The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley]]'', ''[[The New Yogi Bear Show]]'', and ''[[Fantastic Max]]'' were introduced in 1987 and 1988. ''[[The Further Adventures of SuperTed]]'' and ''[[Paddington Bear (1989 TV series)|Paddington Bear]]'' debuted in 1989. Hanna-Barbera was affected by the financial troubles of Taft, which had been acquired by the American Financial Corporation in 1987 and renamed to ''Great American Broadcasting'' the following year.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Many of the deals were overseen by Charles Mechem.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} 

Along with the rest of the American cartoon industry, it began to move away from producing everything in-house in the seventies and eighties. Its product was outsourced to studios in Australia and Asia, including Wang Film Productions, [[Cuckoo's Nest Studios]], [[Mr. Big cartoons|Mr. Big Cartoons]], [[MOOK DLE|Mook Co., Ltd.]], [[Toei Animation]] and Fil-Cartoons.

In November 1991, the Hanna-Barbera studio and library, as well as much of the Ruby-Spears library, were acquired by a 50-50 joint venture between Turner Broadcasting—which by that time had also bought the pre-May 1986 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer library—and Apollo Investment Fund for $320&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |title= TBS Buys Animator Hanna-Barbera Library for $320 Million |location= Atlanta  |publisher= AP |date= Oct 29, 1991 |url= http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1991/TBS-Buys-Animator-Hanna-Barbera-Library-for-$320-Million/id-e4b7fe7b58573927b9188329b6cd66c1 |accessdate= May 22, 2014}}</ref> This was with the intention of launching an all animation based network aimed at children and younger audiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Turner's president of entertainment [[Scott Sassa]] hired [[Fred Seibert]], a former executive for [[MTV Networks]], to head Hanna-Barbera. He immediately filled the gap left by the departure of most of their creative crew during the Great American years with new animators, writers, directors and producers, including Pat Ventura, [[Craig McCracken]], [[Donovan Cook]], [[Genndy Tartakovsky]], [[David Feiss]], [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Van Partible]], [[Stewart St. John]], and [[Butch Hartman]] with new production head [[Buzz Potamkin]].<ref>[http://fredseibert.com/post/68958612/what-a-cartoon-world-premiere-toons-video-frame "What A Cartoon! Frame Grabs]</ref>

The studio was renamed ''H-B Productions Company'' in 1992, changing its name once again to ''Hanna-Barbera Cartoons, Inc.'' a year later, the same year that Turner acquired the remaining interests of Hanna-Barbera from Apollo Investment Fund for $255&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|title= COMPANY NEWS; TURNER BUYS REMAINING 50% STAKE IN HANNA-BARBERA|work=The New York Times|date=December 30, 1993|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/30/business/company-news-turner-buys-remaining-50-stake-in-hanna-barbera.html?scp=5&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventures]]'' made its debut on CBS following ''[[The Adventures of Don Coyote and Sancho Panda]]'', ''[[Tom and Jerry Kids]]'', ''[[Wake, Rattle, and Roll]]'' (known as ''Jump, Rattle, and Roll''), ''[[Gravedale High|Rick Moranis in Gravedale High]]'' and ''[[Midnight Patrol: Adventures in the Dream Zone]]'' in 1990. Next came ''[[The Pirates of Dark Water]]'' then ''[[Yo Yogi!]]'', ''[[Young Robin Hood]]'', ''[[Fish Police]]'', ''[[Capitol Critters]]'' and a second ''[[The Addams Family (1992 animated series)|Addams Family]]'' series in 1991 and 1992. New shows of ''[[Droopy: Master Detective]]'', ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers|The New Adventures of Captain Planet]]'', ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]'' and ''[[2 Stupid Dogs]]'' made their premieres in 1993, then ''[[Dumb and Dumber (TV series)|Dumb and Dumber]]'' in 1995.

===Partnership with Cartoon Network and dissolution: 1992–2001===
In 1992, Turner launched [[Cartoon Network]] to broadcast its huge library of animated classics, of which Hanna-Barbera was the core contributor. As a result, several cartoons, especially the Hanna-Barbera ones, were rebroadcast.<ref>{{cite news|title= THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Turner Broadcasting Plans To Start a Cartoon Channel|work=The New York Times|date=February 19, 1992|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/19/business/the-media-business-turner-broadcasting-plans-to-start-a-cartoon-channel.html?scp=24&sq=Hanna-Barbera&st=cse|accessdate=August 17, 2010 |first=Bill |last=Carter}}</ref> In 1994, Turner Broadcasting refocused the studio to produce new shows exclusively for the Turner-owned networks and then in 1995, the studio produced ''[[What a Cartoon!]]'' (also known as ''World Premiere Toons''), an animation showcase series led by [[Fred Seibert]], founder of [[Frederator Studios]], featuring new creator driven cartoon shorts developed by its in-house staff. Several original series emerged from the project, giving the company their first smash hits since ''The Smurfs'' and the first show based on a ''What a Cartoon'' short was [[Genndy Tartakovsky]]'s ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]''. This spawned a multitude of new programs for the network known as ''[[Cartoon Cartoons]]'' while in 1996, regular new Hanna-Barbera shows ''[[Cave Kids]]'' and ''[[The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest]]'' premiered on Cartoon Network. In 2000, ''[[Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat|The Mansion Cat]]'' featuring ''Tom and Jerry'' first aired.

Following the Turner and [[Time Warner]] merger, Hanna-Barbera was absorbed into [[Warner Bros. Animation]] in 2001 and the Hanna-Barbera name began to disappear from newer shows by the studio in favor of the [[Cartoon Network Studios]] label. This came in handy with shows that were produced outside the company, but Cartoon Network had a hand in producing as well as shows the studio continued to produce. Hanna died of throat cancer on March 22, 2001, ending the decades-long partnership of 60 years in animation with Barbera, who would since then, move on to work for Warner Bros. Animation on new television shows of ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'', ''[[Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry Tales]]'' until his passing on December 18, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/121906dnentbarberaobit.1e1b331.html |title= Cartoon creator Joe Barbera dies |accessdate=August 16, 2008 |date= December 18, 2006 |publisher= Dallas Morning News/[[Associated Press|AP]] |archivedate= August 16, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225023220/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/121906dnentbarberaobit.1e1b331.html}} {{dead link|date=November 2012}}</ref> As of 2016, Hanna-Barbera Productions is an in-name-only unit of Warner Bros. Animation, which administers the rights to its catalog and characters.

===Shared cinematic universe: 2018===
Warner Bros. announced plans for a [[shared universe]] of [[Traditional animation|traditional-animated]] films based on various Hanna-Barbera characters, starting with ''[[S.C.O.O.B.]]'', a reboot of the [[Scooby-Doo (film series)|''Scooby-Doo'' film series]], scheduled for September 21, 2018 in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/04/12/scooby-doo-reboot-hanna-barbera-warner-bros|title=Scooby-Doo reboot could lead to a Hanna-Barbera Cinematic Universe|accessdate=April 14, 2016|date=April 13, 2016|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>

==Sound effects==
Besides its famous cartoon shows and characters, Hanna-Barbera was also noted for their large library of sound effects. Besides cartoon-style sound effects (such as ricochets, slide whistles, etc.), they also had familiar sounds used for transportation, household items and more. When Hanna and Barbera started their studio in 1957, they created a handful of sound effects, and had limited choices. They also took some sounds from the then-defunct Metro-Goldwyn Mayer animation studio and by 1958, they began to expand and added more sound effects to their library. Besides creating a lot of their own effects, they also collected sounds from other movie and cartoon studios, such as Warner Bros. Animation, and even Disney. Some of their famous sound effects included a rapid bongo drum take used for when a character's feet were scrambling before taking off, a "KaBONG" sound produced on a guitar for when [[Quick Draw McGraw]], in his Zorro-style "El Kabong" crime fighting guise, would smash a guitar over a villain's head, the sound of a car's brake drum combined with a [[bulb horn]] for when Fred Flintstone would drop his bowling ball onto his foot, an automobile's tires squealing with a "skipping" effect added for when someone would slide to a sudden stop, a bass-drum-and-cymbal combination called the "Boom Crash" for when someone would fall down or smack into an object, a xylophone being struck rapidly on the same note for a tip-toeing effect, and a violin being plucked with the tuning pegs being raised to simulate something like pulling out a cat's whisker. Also, there are some other sound effects like the crazy laugh sound done by veteran voice actor Daws Butler, a boing drum combined with a wiggle device for when something bounces off, other drum and cymbal crashes, a big bite performed by the voice of Muttley himself, a high frequency spring plucked four rapid times for when a laser gets shot, a big stone bell heavily bonked by another big stone for a Bronk effect, and a musical instrument vinged seven times for a slow motion replay of a clip, called Charlie Brown's Slo-Mo Take.

The cartoons also used [[Castle thunder (sound effect)|Castle Thunder]], a thunderclap sound effect that was commonly used in movies and television shows from the 1940s to the 1980s. Other common sounds such as Peeong (a frying pan hitting sound with a doppler effect) and Bilp were used regularly in all of its cartoons. Starting in the 1960s, other cartoon studios began using the sound effects, including [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]], [[Universal Animation Studios]], [[Disney Television Animation]], [[Film Roman]], [[MGM Animation]], [[Cartoon Network Studios]], [[DiC Entertainment]], [[Hasbro Studios]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and many others. By the 21st century, almost every animation studio was using the sound effects. Like Hanna-Barbera was in the 90s, they are used sparingly, while some cartoons and non-animated shows like Warner Bros. Animation's ''[[Krypto the Superdog]]'', Nelvana's ''[[The Magic School Bus (TV series)|The Magic School Bus]]'', Disney's ''[[Bonkers (TV series)|Bonkers]]'', Spumco's ''[[Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon]]'' , and A&E's ''[[Parking Wars]]'', make heavy use of the classic sound effects, mostly for a retro feel. Some Hanna-Barbera sounds show up in various sound libraries such as Valentino and Audio Network. Hanna-Barbera Records (the studio's short-lived record division) released a set of LP records in the late 1960s entitled Hanna-Barbera's Drop-Ins, which contained quite a few of the classic sound effects. This LP set was only available for radio and television stations and other production studios. In 1973, and again in 1986, Hanna-Barbera released a second sound effect record set, a seven-LP set entitled The Hanna-Barbera Library of Sounds, which, like the previous set, contained several of the classic sound effects. 

Like the previous set, this was only available to production companies and radio/TV stations. The 1986 version was also available as a two compact-disc set. In 1993, the last president of the studio, [[Fred Seibert]] recalled his early production experiences with early LP releases of the studio's effects, and commissioned [[Sound Ideas]] to release a four-CD set entitled The Hanna-Barbera Sound FX Library, featuring nearly all of the original H-B sound effects used from 1957 to 1992, a more vast collection compared to the early LP releases (including the sounds H-B had borrowed from other studios). The sound effects were digitally remastered, so they would sound better on new digital soundtracks. A fifth CD was added in 1996, entitled Hanna-Barbera Lost Treasures, and featured more sound effects, including sounds from Space Ghost and The Impossibles. Also in 1994, [[Rhino Records]] released a CD containing some of Hanna-Barbera's famous sound effects, titled simply as Hanna-Barbera Cartoon Sound FX, and also included some answering-machine messages and birthday greetings and short stories starring Hanna-Barbera characters, and was hosted by Fred Flintstone. In 1996, it was reissued with the Hanna-Barbera's Pic-A-Nic Basket of Cartoon Classics CD set, which also contained three other CDs of Hanna-Barbera TV theme songs, background music and songs from ''The Flintstones''. Here, the CD was relabeled as The Greatest Cartoon Sound Effects Ever. 

In the 1980s, Hanna-Barbera slowly began to cease using their trademark sound effects. This was especially true with the action cartoons of the time, such as ''Sky Commanders''. By the 1990s, with cartoons, such as ''Fish Police'' and ''SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron'', the sound effects were virtually nonexistent, being replaced with newer, digitally recorded sounds (mostly from Sound Ideas), as well as the Looney Tunes sound library by [[Treg Brown]]. A few early 1990s cartoons continued to use the sound effects, such as ''Tom & Jerry Kids'' and ''The Addams Family''. By 1996, each series from the studio typically had its own set of sound effects, including some selected from the Hanna-Barbera sound library, as well as some new ones and various sounds from Disney and Warner Bros. cartoons (this was especially true of ''Dexter's Laboratory'' and ''[[Cow and Chicken]]''). Several of the classic Hanna-Barbera sound effects still pop up from time to time in many of Cartoon Network Studios' productions. However, on the recent Warner Bros. produced ''Scooby-Doo'' shows (''What's New, Scooby-Doo?'', ''Shaggy & Scooby-Doo Get a Clue!'', ''Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated'' and ''[[Be Cool, Scooby-Doo!]]''), the Hanna-Barbera sound effects are very rarely used.
