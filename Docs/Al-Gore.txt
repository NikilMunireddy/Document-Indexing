'''Albert Arnold''' "'''Al'''" '''Gore Jr.''' (born March 31, 1948) is an American politician and environmentalist who served as the [[List of Vice Presidents of the United States|45th]] [[Vice President of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001 under [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].  Chosen as Clinton's running mate [[Bill Clinton presidential campaign, 1992|in their successful 1992 campaign]], he was reelected in 1996. At the end of Clinton's second term, Gore was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[List of United States Democratic Party presidential tickets|nominee]] for President in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]]. After leaving office, Gore remained prominent as an author and [[environmentalism|environmental]] activist, whose work in [[Individual and political action on climate change|climate change activism]] earned him (jointly with the [[IPCC]]) the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2007.

Gore was an elected official for 24 years. He was a [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] from [[Tennessee]] (1977–85) and from 1985 to 1993 served as one of the state's [[United States Senate|Senators]]. He served as Vice President during the [[Clinton administration]] from 1993 to 2001. In the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], in what was one of the closest presidential races in history, Gore won the [[popular vote]] but lost in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] to Republican [[George W. Bush]].  A controversial election dispute over a [[Florida election recount|vote recount in Florida]] was settled by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], which [[Bush v.

==Harvard, the Vietnam War, journalism, and Vanderbilt (1965–76)==

===Harvard===
Gore enrolled in [[Harvard College]] in 1965, initially planning to major in English and write novels but later deciding to major in government.<ref name="Gore's Grades"/><ref name=harvardnyt/> On his second day on campus, he began campaigning for the [[freshman]] student government council and was elected its president.<ref name=harvardnyt/>

Although he was an avid reader who fell in love with scientific and mathematical theories,<ref name=harvardnyt/> he did not do well in science classes in college and avoided taking math.<ref name="Gore's Grades"/> His grades during his first two years put him in the lower one-fifth of the class. During his [[sophomore]] year, he reportedly spent much of his time watching television, [[Cue sport|shooting pool]], and occasionally smoking [[marijuana]].<ref name="Gore's Grades"/><ref name=harvardnyt/> In his junior and senior years, he became more involved with his studies, earning As and Bs.<ref name="Gore's Grades"/> In his senior year, he took a class with oceanographer and global warming theorist [[Roger Revelle]], who sparked Gore's interest in global warming and other environmental issues.<ref name=harvardnyt/><ref>Turque, ''Inventing Al Gore'', p. 59.</ref> Gore earned an A on his thesis, "The Impact of Television on the Conduct of the Presidency, 1947-1969", and graduated with an [[Bachelors of Arts|A.B.]] ''[[cum laude]]'' in June 1969.<ref name="Gore's Grades"/><ref>Turque, ''Inventing Al Gore'', p. 388.</ref>

Gore attended college during the era of anti-[[Vietnam War]] protests. Though he was against that war, he disagreed with the tactics of the student [[protest movement]], thinking it silly and juvenile to take anger at the war out on a private university.<ref name=harvardnyt/> He and his friends did not participate in Harvard demonstrations. John Tyson, a former roommate, recalled that "We distrusted these movements a lot .... We were a pretty traditional bunch of guys, positive for civil rights and women's rights but formal, transformed by the social revolution to some extent but not buying into something we considered detrimental to our country."<ref name=harvardnyt/><ref name=frosh>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/galleries/lifeofgore/photo8.htm|title=The Life of Al Gore, The Path to Politics|accessdate=June 28, 2010|date=December 31, 1999|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref> Gore helped his father write an [[anti-war]] address to the [[Democratic National Convention of 1968]] but stayed with his parents in their hotel room during the violent protests.<ref name=harvardnyt/>

===Military service===

When Gore graduated in 1969, his student deferment ended and he immediately became eligible for the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]]. His father, a vocal anti-Vietnam War critic, was facing a reelection in 1970. Gore eventually decided that the best way he could contribute to the anti-war effort was to enlist in the Army, which would improve his father's reelection prospects.<ref name=biosen>{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Gore,_Albert.pdf|title=Albert A.

Gore has said that his other reason for enlisting was that he did not want someone with fewer options than he to go in his place.<ref name="campaign portrait">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,965770,00.html|title=Campaign Portrait, Al Gore:Trying to Set Himself Apart|author=Talbott, Strobe |authorlink=

In addition, Michael Roche, Gore's editor for ''The Castle Courier,'' stated that "anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on his butt and he didn't."<ref name=mixed>{{cite news|url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/politics/camp/071100wh-gore.html|title=For Gore, Army Years Mixed Vietnam and Family Politics|accessdate=June 29, 2010|author=Henneberger, Melinda|date=July 11, 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

After enlisting in August 1969, Gore returned to the anti-war Harvard campus in his military uniform to say goodbye to his adviser and was "jeered" at by students.<ref name=pbschron/><ref name=harvardnyt/> He later said he was astonished by the "emotional field of negativity and disapproval and piercing glances that ... certainly felt like real hatred".<ref name=harvardnyt/>

Gore had basic training at [[Fort Dix]] from August to October, and then was assigned to be a journalist at [[Fort Rucker]], Alabama. In April 1970, he was "Soldier of the Month".<ref name=pbschron/><ref name=mixed/>

His orders to be sent to Vietnam were "held up" for some time and he suspected that this was due to a fear by the [[Nixon administration]] that if something happened to him, his father would gain sympathy votes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} He was finally shipped to [[South Vietnam|Vietnam]] on January 2, 1971, after his father had lost his seat in the Senate during the [[United States Senate elections, 1970|1970 Senate election]], becoming one "of only about a dozen of the 1,115 Harvard graduates in the Class of '69 who went to Vietnam."<ref name=mixed/><ref name=boy/><ref name=father>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/22/us/a-political-father-who-chose-the-high-road-and-unpopular-stands.html|title=A Political Father Who Chose the High Road and Unpopular Stands|accessdate=June 29, 2010|author=Henneberger, Melinda|date=May 22, 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Gore was stationed with the [[20th Engineer Brigade]] in [[Bien Hoa]] and was a journalist with ''The Castle Courier.''<ref name=cc>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/galleries/lifeofgore/photo10.htm|title=The Life of Al Gore, The Path To Politics |accessdate=June 28, 2010|author=H.

Of his time in the Army, Gore later stated, "I didn't do the most, or run the gravest danger. But I was proud to wear my country's uniform."<ref name=tells/> He also later stated that his experience in Vietnam "didn't change my conclusions about the war being a terrible mistake, but it struck me that opponents to the war, including myself, really did not take into account the fact that there were an awful lot of [[South Vietnamese]] who desperately wanted to hang on to what they called freedom. Coming face to face with those sentiments expressed by people who did the laundry and ran the restaurants and worked in the fields was something I was naively unprepared for."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://issues2000.org/Celeb/More_Al_Gore_Homeland_Security.htm|title=More Al Gore on Homeland Security|year=2000|accessdate=June 29, 2010|publisher=[[On The Issues]]}}</ref>

===Vanderbilt and journalism===
Gore was "dispirited" after his return from Vietnam.<ref name=biosen/> [[NashvillePost.com]] noted that, "his father's defeat made service in a conflict he deeply opposed even more abhorrent to Gore. His experiences in the war zone don't seem to have been deeply traumatic in themselves; although the engineers were sometimes fired upon, Gore has said he didn't see full-scale combat. Still, he felt that his participation in the war was wrong."<ref name=boy/>

Al Gore served as Vice President during the [[Clinton Administration]].  Clinton and Gore were inaugurated on January 20, 1993. At the beginning of the first term, Clinton and Gore developed a "two-page agreement outlining their relationship." Clinton committed himself to regular lunch meetings, recognized Gore as a principal adviser on nominations, and appointed some of Gore's chief advisers to key White House staff positions [...] Clinton involved Gore in decision-making to an unprecedented degree for a Vice President. Through their weekly lunches and daily conversations, Gore became the president's "indisputable chief adviser."<ref name=biosen/>

Gore had a particular interest in reducing "waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government and advocated trimming the size of the bureaucracy and the number of regulations."<ref name=biosen/> During the [[Clinton Administration]], the U.S. economy expanded, according to David Greenberg (professor of history and media studies at [[Rutgers University]]) who said that "by the end of the Clinton presidency, the numbers were uniformly impressive. Besides the record-high surpluses and the record-low poverty rates, the economy could boast the longest economic expansion in history; the lowest unemployment since the early 1970s; and the lowest poverty rates for single mothers, black Americans, and the aged."<ref name="econ">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history_lesson/2008/02/memo_to_obama_fans.html|title=Memo to Obama Fans: Clinton's presidency was not a failure|author=Greenberg, David|accessdate=Aug 14, 2013|work=The History Behind Current Events}}</ref>

According to Leslie Budd, author of ''E-economy: Rhetoric or Business Reality'', this economic success was due, in part, to Gore's continued role as an ''[[Atari Democrat]],'' promoting the development of [[information technology]], which led to the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] (c. 1995-2001).<ref name=eeconomy>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KKk0jnq0W5YC&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=dot-com+boom+Clinton+Gore|title=The puzzle of India's governance: culture, context and comparative theory|accessdate=July 10, 2010|author=Mitra, Subrata K.|date=January 13, 2006|work=|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-34861-4}}</ref> Clinton and Gore entered office planning to finance research that would "flood the economy with innovative goods and services, lifting the general level of prosperity and strengthening American industry."<ref name=hightech>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/10/science/clinton-to-promote-high-technology-with-gore-in-charge.html|first=William|last=Broad|title=Clinton to Promote High Technology, With Gore in Charge|date=November 10, 1992|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 29, 2010}}</ref> Their overall aim was to fund the development of, "robotics, smart roads, biotechnology, machine tools, magnetic-levitation trains, fiber-optic communications and national computer networks.

During the election and his term as Vice President, Gore popularized the term ''[[Information Superhighway]]'', which became synonymous with the [[Internet]], and he was involved in the creation of the [[National Information Infrastructure]].<ref name=hightech/> Gore first discussed his plans to emphasize information technology at [[UCLA]] on January 11, 1994 in a speech at [[The Superhighway Summit]].

During the 1990s, Gore spoke out on a number of issues. In a 1992 speech on the [[Gulf War]], Gore stated that he twice attempted to get the U.S. government to pull the plug on support to [[Saddam Hussein]], citing Hussein's use of poison gas, support of terrorism, and his burgeoning nuclear program, but was opposed both times by the Reagan and Bush administrations.<ref name=92speech2>{{cite web|url=http://tv.breitbart.com/rewind-gore-blasts-ghw-bush-for-ignoring-iraq-terror-ties/|title=Rewind: Gore Blasts G.H.W.

Soon afterwards, Gore also had to contend with the [[Lewinsky scandal]], involving an affair between President Clinton and an intern, [[Monica Lewinsky]].

He is my friend [...] I want to ask you now, every single one of you, to join me in supporting him."<ref name=biosen/> After [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|Clinton was impeached]] Gore continued to defend him stating, "I've defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now [...] to do everything I can to help him be the best president possible."<ref name=biosen/>

===Criticism of Bush===
Beginning in late 2002, Gore began to publicly criticize the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]. In a September 23, 2002 speech given before the [[Commonwealth Club of California]], Gore criticized President [[George W. Bush]] and [[United States Congress|Congress]] for the rush to war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in [[Iraq]]. He compared this decision to the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] (which Gore had voted for) stating, "Back in 1991, I was one of a handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War [...] But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002. The circumstances are really completely different. To review a few of them briefly: in 1991, Iraq had crossed an international border, invaded a neighboring sovereign nation and annexed its territory. Now by contrast in 2002, there has been no such invasion."<ref>{{cite web

While Gore has criticized Bush for his Katrina response he has not spoken publicly about his part in the evacuation of 270 patients on September 3 & 4, 2005 from Charity Hospital in New Orleans to Tennessee. On September 1 Gore was contacted by Charity Hospital's Neurosurgeon Dr. David Kline who had operated on his son Albert through Greg Simon of [[FasterCures]]. Kline informed Gore and Simon of the desperate conditions at the hospital and asked Gore and Simon to arrange relief. On Gore's personal financial commitment two airlines each provided a plane with one flight latter underwritten by [[Larry Flax]]. The flights were flown by volunteer airline crews and medically staffed by Gore's cousin, retired Col. Dar LaFon, and family physician Dr. Anderson Spickard and were accompanied by Gore and Albert III.

Bush]], that "all three won the office only after... anomalies in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]", that the first two were defeated for re-election in a populist backlash, and finally that "the men who first lost to the presidential progeny and then beat them" (i.e. [[Andrew Jackson]] and [[Grover Cleveland]]) "each won a sort of immortality--having his image placed on a unit of US currency", and that Gore should answer this call of history.<ref>Woolley, Peter J.

====Criticism====
Gore's involvement in environmental issues [[Environmental activism of Al Gore#Environmental criticism|has been criticized]].

Data in ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' have been questioned. In a 2007 [[Dimmock v Secretary of State for Education and Skills|court case]], a British judge said that while he had "no doubt ...the film was broadly accurate" and its "four main scientific hypotheses ...are supported by a vast quantity of research",<ref name=court>{{cite BAILII

He ruled that the film could be shown to schoolchildren in the UK if guidance notes given to teachers were amended to balance out the film's one-sided political views.

In the late 1980s and 1990s, Gore was criticized for his involvement in asking the [[EPA]] for less strict pollution controls for the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee – North Carolina)#History|Pigeon River]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/gores-pollution-problem-171130 |title=Gore's Pollution Problem |first=Michael |last=Isikoff |work=Newsweek |date=November 23, 1997 |accessdate=July 20, 2015 |subscription=yes}}</ref>

When asked by [[Bjørn Lomborg]] to debate whether spending on health and education should take priority over limiting carbon emissions, Gore responded that he would not debate because the "scientific community has gone through this chapter and verse. We have long since passed the time when we should pretend this is a 'on the one hand, on the other hand' issue . . . .
