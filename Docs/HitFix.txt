==Founders==
HitFix was founded by ex-Reed Business Information Development executive, Jen Sargent, and former ''[[L.A. Times]]'' and [[MSN.com]] film editor, Gregory Ellwood. Sargent and Ellwood's goal was to create a site that fit into the gap between trade publications and gossip- or celebrity scandal-driven sites, such as [[TMZ.com|TMZ]], and to target an audience slightly skewed towards males – a unique approach in a female-driven industry<ref name="multiple3">[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997435?refCatId=18 Article on Variety.com] {{wayback|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117997435?refCatId=18 |date=20121107120828 }}</ref> - while catering to 18- to 34-year-olds.<ref>[http://www.socaltech.com/interview_with_jennifer_sargent_hitfix/s-0036989.html/ socaltech.com] {{wayback|url=http://www.socaltech.com/interview_with_jennifer_sargent_hitfix/s-0036989.html/ |date=20120513223014 }}</ref>

==Angel Investment==

HitFix received its first funding from Golden Seeds, the fourth largest angel investment group in the United States, in 2009.  Since then, HitFix has twice benefited from investment from the [[Tech coast angels|Tech Coast Angels]], one of the largest angel investment networks in Southern California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.socaltech.com/venture_capital_totals_6_3__m_in_southern_california_in_q3/s-0038812.html|work=socaltech.com|publisher=|title=Venture Capital Totals $603.2M In Southern California In Q3|date=October 18, 2011}}</ref> The first such investment came in February 2009 in the amount of $850,000. In June 2010, the Angels added to their commitment investing an additional $1,600,000.<ref>[http://www.techcoastangels.com/press/tech-coast-angels-joins-16m-investment-hitfix-unique-content-driven-entertainment-website Tech Coast Angels Joins $1.6M Investment in HitFix, Unique Content Driven Entertainment Website]</ref>  In addition to Golden Seeds and Tech Coast Angels, HitFix investors include HBS Angels, Liquid Capital, and Gordon Crawford.
