'''''Hansard''''' is the traditional name of the transcripts of Parliamentary Debates in Britain and many Commonwealth countries. It is named after [[Thomas Curson Hansard]] (1776–1833), a London printer and publisher, who was the first official printer to the parliament at Westminster.

==Origins==
Though the history of the Hansard began in the British parliament, each of Britain's colonies developed a separate and distinctive history. Before 1771, the British Parliament had long been a highly secretive body. The official record of the actions of the House was publicly available, but there was no record of the debates. The publication of remarks made in the House became a breach of Parliamentary privilege, punishable by the two Houses of Parliament. As the populace became interested in parliamentary debates, more independent newspapers began publishing unofficial accounts of them.

The many penalties implemented by the government, including fines, dismissal, imprisonment, and investigations, are reflective of "the difficulties faced by independent newspapermen who took an interest in the development of Upper Canada, and who, in varying degrees, attempted to educate the populace to the shortcomings of their rulers".<ref name=Ward />

Several editors used the device of veiling parliamentary debates as debates of fictitious societies or bodies. The names under which parliamentary debates were published include ''Proceedings of the Lower Room of the Robin Hood Society'' and ''Debates of the Senate of Magna Lilliputia''.<ref name="C-H">[http://www.commonwealth-hansard.org/chea_story.asp Story of Hansard] — Commonwealth Hansard Editors Association</ref> The Senate of Magna Lilliputia was printed in [[Edward Cave]]'s ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'', which was first published in 1732. The names of the speakers were carefully "[[Fillet (redaction)|filleted]]"; for example, Sir [[Robert Walpole]] was thinly disguised as "Sr. R―t W―le".<ref name=Trewin>{{cite book|last=Trewin|first=J.C|title=Printer to the House: The Story of Hansard|year=1952|publisher=The Chapel River Press|location=Andover, Hants, Great Britain|page=5}}</ref>

In 1771 [[Brass Crosby]], who was [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]], had brought before him a printer by the name of John Miller who dared publish reports of Parliamentary proceedings. He released the man, but was subsequently ordered to appear before the House to explain his actions. Crosby was committed to the [[Tower of London]], but when he was brought to trial, several judges refused to hear the case and after protests from the public, Crosby was released.<ref>[http://dougsaunders.net/2010/12/brass-crosby-julian-assange-wikileaks/ dougsaunders.net: "Brass Crosby: the Julian Assange of 1771" 17 Dec 2010]</ref> Parliament ceased to punish the publishing of its debates as harshly, partly due to the campaigns of [[John Wilkes]] on behalf of free speech. There then began several attempts to publish reports of debates. Among the early successes, the ''Parliamentary Register'' published by [[John Almon]] and [[John Debrett]] began in 1775 and ran until 1813.

[[William Cobbett]] (1763–1835), a noted radical and publisher, began publishing ''Parliamentary Debates'' as a supplement to his ''[[Political Register]]'' in 1802, eventually extending his reach back with the ''Parliamentary History''. Cobbett's avocation for the freedom of the press was severely punished by the British Government. On June 5, 1810 [[William Cobbett]] stood trial for seditious libel for an article he wrote against the British Government which was published by [[Thomas Curson Hansard]]. Cobbett was found "guilty, upon the fullest and most satisfactory evidence".<ref name=Trewin /> The court sentence read: "The court do adjudge that you, [[William Cobbett]] pay to our Lord the King a fine of £1000; that you be imprisoned in His Majesty's gaol of Newgate for the space of two years, and that at expiration of that time you enter into a recognizance to keep the peace for seven years—yourself in the sum of £3000, and two good and sufficient sureties in the sum of £1000; and further, that you be imprisoned till that recognizance be entered into, and that fine paid".<ref name=Trewin /> This sentence is aptly described by J.C Trewin as "vindictive".<ref name=Trewin /> The Court argued that [[Thomas Curson Hansard]], who had "seen the copy before it was printed, ought not to have suffered it to have been printed at all"<ref name=Trewin /> and was sentenced to three months imprisonment in the [[King's Bench Prison]].

Cobbett's reports were printed by [[Thomas Curson Hansard]] from 1809; in 1812, Cobbett's finances ran asunder and he divested himself of his proprietorship of both the ''Parliamentary Debates'' and ''Parliamentary History'', which then "passed into the hands of Hansard in 1812".<ref name=Ward /> ''Cobbett's Parliamentary Debates'' became ''Hansard Parliamentary Debates'', "abbreviated over time to the now familiar Hansard".<ref name=Ward /> From 1829 the name "Hansard" appeared on the title page of each issue.<ref>[http://www.hansard-westminster.co.uk/story.asp ::: Department of the Official Report (Hansard) – Story of Hansard :::<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Neither Cobbett nor Hansard ever employed anyone to take down notes of the debates, which were taken from a multiplicity of sources in the morning newspapers. For this reason, early editions of ''Hansard'' are not to be absolutely relied upon as a guide to everything discussed in Parliament.

Hansard was remarkably successful in seeing off competition such as Almon and Debrett, and the later ''Mirror of Parliament'' published by J. H. Barrow from 1828 to 1843; Barrow's work was more comprehensive but he checked each speech with the Member and allowed them to "correct" anything they wished they had not said. The last attempt at a commercial rival was ''[[The Times]]'' which published debates in the 1880s. In 1878 a subsidy was granted to the Hansard press and at that point reporters were employed.<ref name=Ward /> Despite hiring contract reporters there were still widespread complaints about the accuracy of the debates. In 1889 Henry Hansard, the son of Thomas Hansard, broke the family connection with the debates.<ref name=Ward />

==In the United Kingdom==

The ''Hansard'' of today, a fully comprehensive account of every speech, began in 1909 when [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] took over the publication and established its own staff of official Hansard reporters. At the same time the decision was made to publish debates of the two houses in separate volumes, and to change the front cover from orange-red to light blue. A larger page format was introduced with new technology in 1980.

''Hansard'' is not a word-for-word transcript of debates in Parliament. Its terms of reference are those set by a House of Commons Select Committee in 1893, as being a report

{{quote|...which, though not strictly verbatim, is substantially the verbatim report with repetitions and redundancies omitted and with obvious mistakes (including grammatical mistakes) corrected, but which, on the other hand, leaves out nothing that adds to the meaning of the speech or illustrates the argument.<ref name="Hansard terms of reference">Ian Church, "Official Report [HANSARD] Centenary Volume", 2009, p. xvi.</ref>}}

One instance of such an eliminated redundancy involves the calling of members in the House of Commons. In that House, the Speaker must call on a member by name before that member may speak, but ''Hansard'' makes no mention of the recognition accorded by the Speaker. Also, ''Hansard'' sometimes adds extraneous material to make the remarks less ambiguous. For example, though members refer to each other as "the hon. Member for ''Constituency Name''{{-"}} rather than by name, ''Hansard'' adds, in parentheses, the name of the member being referred to, the first time that Member is referred to in a speech or debate. When a Member simply points at another whose constituency he or she cannot remember, ''Hansard'' identifies him or her.

Any interruption to debate  will be marked with the word "(Interruption)". This understated phrase covers a variety of situations, ranging from members laughing uproariously to the physical invasion of the chamber. Interjections from seated members, such as heckling during [[Prime minister's questions|Prime Minister's Questions]], are generally only included if the member who is speaking responds to the interjection.

''Hansard'' also publishes written answers made by Government [[Minister (government)|ministers]] in response to questions formally posed by members. In 1839, Hansard, by order of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], printed and published a report stating that an [[obscenity|indecent]] book published by a Mr. Stockdale was circulating in [[Newgate Prison]]. Stockdale sued for [[defamation]] but Hansard's defence, that the statement was true, succeeded. On publication of a reprint, Stockdale sued again but Hansard was ordered by the House to plead that he had acted under order of the Commons and was protected by [[parliamentary privilege]]. In the resulting case of ''[[Stockdale v. Hansard]]'',<ref>(1839) 9 Ad & El 1</ref><ref>State Trials (New Series) III, 723.</ref> the court found that the House held no privilege to order publication of defamatory material. In consequence, Parliament passed the [[Parliamentary Papers Act 1840]] to establish privilege for publications under the House's authority.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Bradley, A.W.  |author2=Ewing, K.D. | year=2003 | title=Constitutional and Administrative Law | publisher=Pearson | location=London | edition=13th | pages=219–220 | isbn=0-582-43807-1}}</ref><ref>Stockdale, E.

Since 1909—and for important votes before then—''Hansard'' has listed how members have voted in [[Division (vote)|divisions]]. Furthermore, the proceedings and debates in committee are also published in separate volumes. For many years the House of Commons ''Hansard'' did not formally acknowledge the existence of parties in the House, except obliquely, with Members' references to other Members of the same party as "hon. Friends", but in 2003 this changed and members' party affiliations are now identified. The ''Hansard'' of the House of Lords operates entirely independently of its Commons counterpart, but with similar terms of reference. It covers parliamentary business in the House of Lords Chamber itself, as well as the debates in the Moses Room, known as Grand Committee. Parliamentary Written Answers and Statements are also printed. Emma Crewe notes that "Editors view reporters in general as a hive of revolution and anti-establishment attitudes, while they perceive themselves as calm and uncomplaining".<ref name="Crewe2005">{{cite book |last=Crewe |first=Emma |title=Lords of parliament: manners, rituals and politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VHpIwkpFOCkC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=lords+of+parliament+hansard+revolutionary#v=onepage&q=&f=false |accessdate=4 January 2011 |year=2005 |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-7207-9 |page=84}}</ref> The Internet, with the help of volunteers, has made the UK ''Hansard'' more accessible. The UK ''Hansard'' is currently being digitised to a high-level format{{clarify|date=November 2014}} for on-line publication. It is possible to review and search the UK ''Hansard'' from 1803, with the exception of Standing Committees.

Because Hansard is treated as accurate, there is a parliamentary convention whereby if a member of parliament makes an inaccurate statement in parliament, he/she must write a correction in the copy of Hansard kept in the House of Commons library.

==Canada==
[[File:Hansard, Canada, Dominion Parliament (July 17, 1895).jpg|thumb|Sample of Hansard from the Canadian House of Commons, 1895. Shows sample of several members speaking as described in the text.]]

===House of Commons===
As with the Westminster ''Hansard'', the Canadian version is not strictly verbatim, and is guided by the principle of avoiding "repetitions, redundancies and obvious errors". Unlike the UK House of Commons, members are referred to in the House only by the parliamentary ridings they represent ("The member for Halifax West", etc.) or by their cabinet post. ''Hansard'' supplies an affiliation the first time each member speaks in the House on a particular day—"'''Mr. Mathieu Ravignat (Pontiac, NDP''')" or "'''Hon. Lynne Yelich (Minister of State for Western Economic Diversification, CPC.)'''"—and by name only when they rise later to speak.

If interjections give rise to a call for order by the Speaker, they are reported as "'''Some hon. members: Oh, oh!'''" The details of the approval or negativing of motions and bills are reported in rather baroque detail:<ref>[http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Pub=hansard&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=38&Ses=1 Edited Hansard * Table of Contents * Number 159 (Official Version)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Translation===
Given the [[Bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] nature of the Canadian federal government, two equivalent Canadian Hansards are maintained, one in [[French language|French]] and one in [[English language|English]]. This makes it a natural [[Parallel text alignment|parallel text]], and it is often used to train French–English [[machine translation]] programs. In addition to being already translated and aligned, the size of the Hansards and the fact that new material is always being added makes it an attractive [[text corpus|corpus]]. However, its usefulness is hindered by the fact that the translations, although accurate in meaning, are not always literally exact.

The Canadian Hansard records make note of the language used by the members of parliament, so as not to misinterpret the words of the person who has the floor. If the member speaks in French, the English Hansard records would state that the member spoke in French and refer the reader to the French Hansard record.

In one instance, during a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[filibuster]] in the [[Canadian Senate]], Senator [[Philippe Gigantès]] was accused of reading one of his books only so that he could get the translation for free through the Hansard.<ref>Hoy, Claire. ''Nice Work: The Continuing Scandal of Canada's Senate'', p. 165</ref>

===Nova Scotia===
As was the case in many early Canadian regions, the newspapers were the first source of the Parliamentary debates. Canada's first newspaper, The [[Halifax Gazette]] was printed on Grafton street in Halifax in 1752. The two most prominent papers in Parliamentary reporting were the [[Acadian Recorder]], founded in 1813 by Anthony Henry Holland, and the Free Press, established in 1816 by Edward Ward.<ref name="Ward">{{cite book|last=Ward|first=John|title=The Hansard Chronicles|year=1980|publisher=Deneau and Greenberg Publishers Ltd|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=0-88879-023-6}}</ref> Both newspapers reported the debates of the House of Assembly starting in 1817.

The [[Family Compact]] of Nova Scotia, nicknamed "the little compact", "viewed the admission of reporters to the Assembly with distain" and "were not slow to react whenever they felt the slightest affront".<ref name=Ward /> There are many cases which exemplify the "struggle to obtain freedom of the press and parliamentary reportings in the Maritimes" as in the case of William Minns in 1823, who was forced to appear before the bar of the house, and William Milne, who was jailed for not being able to pay his debts.<ref name=Ward />

''The Novascotian'' newspaper would soon become Nova Scotia's most prominent paper after its launch in 1824, which was highly influenced by [[George Young (reporter)|George Young]] who was instrumental in its establishment.<ref name=Ward /> [[George Young (reporter)|George Young]] sought permission from the Assembly to report its debates. Permission was granted, yet he was not provided with very many privileges in the House. They didn't make it easy for him and didn't allow him a seat in the lower deck.

In 1827 [[Joseph Howe]] bought the ''Novascotian'' from Young. "There was no more powerful an advocate of parliamentary debates than Howe".<ref name=Ward /> In 1835 [[Joseph Howe]] was "prosecuted over a publication of a letter in the ''Novascotian''".<ref name=Ward /> He was charged with libel. This case was infamous and is considered to be a "cornerstone in the establishment of freedom of the press in Canada".<ref name=Ward /> Howe, who defended himself in court, was found to be Not Guilty. This is why his case is viewed as a milestone in the development of the free press.

===Newfoundland===
In Newfoundland the struggle for the free press was much more violent. Henry Winton, editor of ''Saint John's Ledger'', "had his ears cut off and was left unconscious by thugs who had been lying in wait for him after dark".<ref name=Ward /> The fate of Winton was to be his printer's as well. 
The Authorities, who were not on friendly terms with the ''Ledger'', made little to no effort to apprehend the culprits.<ref name=Ward /> In another case, a "Gentleman by the name Parsons", of the Newfoundland Patriot, "was sentenced to three months imprisonment in another incident".<ref name=Ward />

===British Columbia===
No complete official record of the debates in the British Columbia Legislature was produced until 1972; a partial record was issued beginning in 1970. Unlike the Ottawa ''Hansard'', opposition members and government backbenchers are identified only by initial and last name: "'''J. Horgan'''". Current cabinet ministers have their names prefaced with "Honourable": "'''Hon. S. Hagen'''". Interjections giving rise to a call for order by the Speaker are reported only as "Interjection". Other interjections are reported as spoken if they are clearly audible and if they are responded to in some way by the member who has the floor. While the details of approval or negativing of motions and bills closely parallel the House of Commons, the reporting is simplified to a style line ("Motion approved" or "Motion negatived").<ref>[http://www.leg.bc.ca/hansard/38th3rd/H70531p.htm Hansard, Thursday, May 31, 2007 p.m., Vol. 22, No. 3 (HTML)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Ontario===
[[File:Ontario Hansard 1953.jpg|right|thumb|Cover page of Hansard for the Province of Ontario, February 12, 1953]]
No official record of the debates in the provincial Legislature was produced before 1944. The debates were reported in various newspapers; the provincial archives clipped and collected these reports in a series of scrapbooks until 1953.<ref>http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/english/about/library_l21.aspx</ref> The provincial website now posts Hansard online, with records from April 21, 1981 to current.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansardindex.ontla.on.ca/ |title=Legislative Debates Search Page |publisher=Hansardindex.ontla.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-12-05}}</ref>
