{{nihongo|'''All Japan Pro Wrestling'''|オールジャパン・プロレスリング|Ōru Japan Puroresuringu|originally 全日本プロレス ''Zen Nihon Puroresu''}} ('''AJPW'''/'''AJP''') is a [[Puroresu|Japanese professional wrestling]] [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] established in 1972. All Japan Pro Wrestling still remains one of the most popular ''[[puroresu]]'' promotions still in operation.

== History ==

=== All Japan under Giant Baba (1972–1999) ===

====NWA Membership (1972–1989)====
The promotion was founded by [[Shohei Baba|Shohei "Giant" Baba]] and the Momota brothers, [[Mitsuo Momota|Mitsuo]] and [[Yoshihiro Momota|Yoshihiro]], sons of [[Rikidōzan]]. Baba, a former professional baseball pitcher, joined the [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance]] (JWA) in 1960. In October 1972, he left the JWA and formed his own group, All Japan. Their first card was on October 21, 1972 at Machida City Gym in [[Tokyo]], Japan. The inaugural roster included Baba, Mitsuo Momota, [[Akio Sato (wrestler)|Akio Sato]], [[Samson Kutsuwada]], Motoshi Okuma and Mashio Koma. [[Thunder Sugiyama]], who had recently left [[International Wrestling Enterprise]], also came along to help and brought some lower-level IWE wrestlers with him on a freelance basis. Some personalities from North America also helped with the few cards, including [[Dory Funk Sr.]], [[Terry Funk]], [[Bruno Sammartino]], [[Dominic DeNucci]], [[Fred Blassie]] and [[Dick Beyer|The Destroyer]].

Baba established the '''Pacific Wrestling Federation (PWF)''' as the governing body for all future titles in All Japan. In the beginning the PWF recognized a [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|world heavyweight championship]] and several "regional championships" given as billing to foreign stars depending from which region they came from, but after All Japan joined the [[National Wrestling Alliance]], the PWF world title was downgraded to a regional championship. The first PWF Chairman, who presented the belts to the winners in title bouts, was [[Lord James Blears]]. As a loyal member of the NWA, All Japan enjoyed the ability to bring in foreigners, and the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] was frequently defended. In the beginning Baba continued the Japanese vs. foreigner formula for the championships, but gradually [[Dory Funk Jr.]] and his brother [[Terry Funk]], as well as [[Mil Máscaras]] from Mexico became fan favorites when wrestling other foreigners and subsequently one of the few foreign wrestlers to become icons in Japan.

====Separation from NWA and new stars (1989–1999) ====

When the NWA territorial system collapsed in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Baba distanced himself from other promoters at home and abroad, and began a system of promoting talent (both Japanese and [[Gaijin|foreign]]) who competed exclusively for his promotion. With the [[Championship unification|unification]] of the titles in All Japan into the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship|Triple Crown Heavyweight]] and the [[World Tag Team Championship (AJPW)|World Tag Team Championship]], as well as the promotion of talent including [[Jumbo Tsuruta]], [[Genichiro Tenryu]], [[Akira Taue]], [[Mitsuharu Misawa]], [[Toshiaki Kawada]] and [[Kenta Kobashi]], the promotion was able to carve a loyal fanbase that lasted during the 1990s. Interpromotional matches were rare, and wrestlers who arrived from other promotions (such as [[Hiroshi Hase]], [[Shigeo Okumura]] and [[Yoshihiro Takayama]]) were not given pushes, but in Hase's case, it was voluntarily, due to his primary involvement with the [[House of Councillors]].

=====First exodus: Super World Sports=====
In April 1990, Genichiro Tenryu led the first exodus of wrestlers ([[The Great Kabuki]], [[Hiromichi Fuyuki|Samson Fuyuki]], [[Koki Kitahara|Tatsumi Kitahara]], [[Masao Orihara]], [[Yoshiaki Yatsu]], Goro Tsurumi, and Shinichi Nakano) lured as they were to form [[Super World of Sports]], which enabled Baba to push Misawa, Kawada, Taue and Kobashi to be his new stars.

=== All Japan under Mitsuharu Misawa (1999–2000) ===
With the death of Shohei "Giant" Baba on January 31, 1999, top star Mitsuharu Misawa immediately inherited the position of company president. On May 28, 2000, Misawa was removed from his position by a majority vote of the executive board. At a regular All Japan board meeting on June 13, 2000, Misawa, Mitsuo Momota (co-vice president, member of directory), Kenta Kobashi (member of directory), Akira Taue (member of directory, chairman), Kenichi Oyagi (member of directory) and [[Yoshihiro Momota]] (member of directory) resigned from their board positions. A day later, Motoko Baba released a two-page written statement, which claimed that Misawa "took no responsibility and abandoned his duty."  In addition, she hinted that Toshiaki Kawada and [[Masanobu Fuchi]] would be the only two native wrestlers to stay with All Japan, as "Kawada and Fuchi have sworn to carry out Baba-san's last wish: to keep All Japan Pro Wrestling alive"; this was confirmed a day later when Kawada and Fuchi both renewed their contracts with All Japan, along with [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] Kyohei Wada.

==== Second exodus: Pro Wrestling Noah ====
On June 16, 2000, 24 out of the 26 contracted native wrestlers for All Japan were led by Misawa for a press conference, where it was announced that they would be leaving the promotion; more than 100 reporters and photographers attended, and Misawa expressed his wish for the promotion to debut in August, with the Differ Ariake being the site of the unnamed promotion's debut. When asked what his reason for leaving All Japan is, Misawa claimed that it was so he could do things in a "modern style." A day later, Misawa announced the promotion's name: [[Pro Wrestling Noah]], which was inspired by the Biblical story where Noah built an ark and put two of every kind of animal in the world in the ark before God destroyed the world.

On June 19, 2000, it was confirmed (at a press conference at All-Japan's dojo held by Toshiaki Kawada and Masanobu Fuchi) that NTV has decided to discontinue broadcasting All Japan after 27 years. However, NTV maintained their 15% stock in All Japan (as Motoko Baba held the remaining 85%), and would prevent All Japan from being put on another network. On June 20, twelve All Japan office employees resigned from their positions with the promotion, with intentions to follow Misawa to Noah. NTV also announced that they will carry weekly tapings of Misawa's Noah promotion, with the title of the program being called "Colosseo." Noah took All Japan's 30-minute timeslot on Sundays at midnight. Misawa was interviewed in Tokyo on June 21, where he announced that he and the other wrestlers leaving to form Noah would compete on four of the sixteen shows in All Japan's Summer Action Series 2000 tour, which began on July 1. NTV also aired the final All Japan TV show on the network, which aired for 45 minutes and featured footage from Jumbo Tsuruta's funeral, the Noah wrestlers' press conference from June 16, Kawada's press conference from June 19, highlights of the first ever Kawada vs. Misawa Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship match from October 21, 1992 and Toshiaki Kawada and Akira Taue vs. Yoshihiro Takayama and [[Takao Omori]] for the World Tag Team Championship from All Japan's Nippon Budokan show from June 9.

On June 28, 2000, Misawa formally announced at a press conference that [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] would debut with two consecutive shows (titled "Departure") in Differ Ariake on August 5 and 6 in Tokyo.

==== Rebuilding ====
On July 2 in the Korakuen Hall, Motoko Baba announced the unfathomable return of Genichiro Tenryu (as Giant Baba publicly swore that he would never be allowed back in All Japan, following a departure in 1990 to form the [[Super World of Sports]]), as he would team with Kawada to face [[Taiyō Kea|Maunnakea Mossman]] and [[Stan Hansen]] on July 23 (at the final tour show). On July 20, 2000, [[Yoshinobu Kanemaru]], [[Takeshi Morishima]], [[Naomichi Marufuji]], [[Kentaro Shiga]], [[Takeshi Rikio]], [[Mitsuo Momota]], [[Rusher Kimura]], Haruka Eigen, [[Tsuyoshi Kikuchi]], [[Kenta Kobayashi]], Takao Omori, Yoshihiro Takayama, [[Jun Izumida]], [[Masao Inoue]], [[Yoshinari Ogawa]], Akira Taue, [[Jun Akiyama]] and Mitsuharu Misawa competed in their last matches for All Japan Pro Wrestling at the sold-out Hakata Star Lane in Fukuoka. After the show, [["Dr. Death" Steve Williams]] came out and shook Misawa's hand, and requested one last singles match between the two. However, Misawa returned to the bus immediately after his match, not staying for the last two matches of the show. Every one of All Japan's titles were vacated due to the departure of the aforementioned wrestlers and title holders. Mrs. Baba appointed Hansen as the new Chairman of All Japan's Pacific Wrestling Federation title governing body, replacing Lord James Blears.

=== Interpromotional feud against New Japan (2000–2002) ===
On August 10, 2000, All Japan mainstay Masanobu Fuchi walked into the [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] ring and declared that his intention was to "break down the walls" between All Japan and New Japan. In response, New Japan foreman [[Riki Choshu]] rushed into the ring and exchanged a firm handshake with Fuchi, signaling the beginning of the cross-promotional alliance. On September 16, 2000, Toshiaki Kawada followed Fuchi's path and vowed to crush New Japan ace [[Kensuke Sasaki]], as he defeated Sasaki in the Tokyo Dome on October 9, 2000; the event sold out the building.<ref>[http://www.puroresufan.com/njpw/history/ajvsnj.php]</ref> In 2001, [[Keiji Mutoh]] and [[Shinjiro Otani]] created the interpromotional stable BATT (Bad Ass Translate Trading), which included All Japan's [[Taiyō Kea]], Michinoku Pro's [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] and Hiroshi Hase. During this time, Mutoh challenged and defeated Tenryu for the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, as well as capturing the World Tag Team Championship with Taiyō Kea. The alliance between the promotions lasted until January 11, 2002.

=== All Japan under Keiji Mutoh: Pro Wrestling Love era (2002–2012) ===
On January 11, 2002, following the end of a year-long cross-promotional [[List of professional wrestling terms#A|angle]] with New Japan Pro Wrestling, [[Keiji Mutoh]] shocked the Japanese wrestling world by defecting to All-Japan as a full-time competitor, taking [[Satoshi Kojima]] and [[Kendo Kashin]] with him. On September 30, 2002, during an All Japan 30th Anniversary party at the famed Tokyo City Hotel, Mrs. Baba officially announced Mutoh's appointment as the new president of All Japan, transferring all of the Baba family stock to him.<ref name=ShiraishiPresidentTS/> Mutoh has upheld some traditional aspects of the Baba-run All Japan, as the [[Champion Carnival]] and [[World's Strongest Tag Determination League]] are still held annually.

Some interpromotional activities that would not have happened under Shohei Baba's watch have taken place, including the previously unfathomable [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship|IWGP Heavyweight Champion]] vs. Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion bout on a New Japan Pro Wrestling event on February 20, 2005; Satoshi Kojima (who was the Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion) defeated [[Hiroyoshi Tenzan]] for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, which made Kojima the only wrestler to ever hold both titles simultaneously (Keiji Mutoh would later accomplish the feat in 2008. However, he would hold the IWGP Championship as Keiji Mutoh, and the Triple Crown Championship as his alter-ego The Great Muta) In addition, Keiji Mutoh and Satoshi Kojima are both New Japan Pro Wrestling alumni, but have played a consistent role in the main event picture of All Japan Pro Wrestling since their arrival to the promotion. Furthermore, Keiji Mutoh competed at a Pro Wrestling Noah event on July 10, 2004, teaming with fellow AJPW wrestler Taiyō Kea to face Mitsuharu Misawa and Yoshinari Ogawa. On July 18, 2004, Mitsuharu Misawa returned to All Japan and defeated Satoshi Kojima at ''Battle Banquet''. Misawa returned to All Japan again on October 31, 2004 for the ''Keiji Mutoh: Love and Bump'' [[pay-per-view]] event, where he (along with [[Keiji Mutoh]]) defeated Hiroshi Hase and Kensuke Sasaki in what was billed as a "Special Dream Tag Match".

On July 10, 2007, Hiroshi Hase was appointed as the new Chairman of the PWF, following Hansen's voluntary resignation. Hase is the third chairman in PWF's history.

On June 7, 2011, Keiji Mutoh announced his resignation as the President of All Japan Pro Wrestling and named Masayuki Uchida as his successor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purolove.com/|title=All Japan: Keiji Muto tritt als Präsident zurück|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zGMFrlFw|date=2011-06-07|accessdate=2011-06-07|archivedate=2011-06-07|work=Purolove}}</ref>

On August 28, 2012, AJPW and Gaora TV announced that AJPW would introduce a new championship called the [[Gaora TV Championship]]. The tournament for the title began on September 8, and ended on October 7 with [[Seiya Sanada]] defeating [[Yasufumi Nakanoue]] in the final to become the inaugural champion.

=== All Japan under Nobuo Shiraishi (2012–2014) ===
On November 1, 2012, [[Information technology|IT]] company Speed Partners purchased all shares of All Japan from Keiji Mutoh and his business partners for [[Japanese yen|¥]]200 million, however, the purchase was not made public until February 2013.<ref name=ShiraishiPresidentTS/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/p-bt-tp0-20130226-1090287.html|script-title=ja:全日買収！企業再生会社が新日に宣戦布告|date=2013-02-26|accessdate=2013-06-02|work=[[Nikkan Sports]]|language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/misc-news/39975-report-all-japan-pro-wrestling-purchased-by-speed-partners|title=Report: All Japan Pro Wrestling purchased by Speed Partners|date=2013-02-26|work=WrestleView|accessdate=2013-02-27|last=Martin|first=Adam}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyoipo.com/moneystyle/money_news/yucasee_media/index.htm?seqid=864 | script-title=ja:全日本プロレス買収で株式上場話も再燃か？ | date=2013-03-01 | accessdate=2013-07-13 | work=Tokyo IPO | language=Japanese}}</ref> In January 2013, AJPW signed [[Atsushi Aoki]], [[Go Shiozaki]], Jun Akiyama, [[Kotaro Suzuki]] and [[Yoshinobu Kanemaru]], all of whom had quit Pro Wrestling Noah the previous month, to return to AJPW, initially as freelancers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/sports/fight/headlines/article/20130127-00000003-spnavi|script-title=ja:秋山、潮崎らノア退団5選手が全日本プロレスに参戦|date=2013-01-27|work=Sports Navi|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|accessdate=2013-01-26|language=Japanese}}</ref> On March 17, 2013, it was announced that Hiroshi Hase was stepping down as PWF Chairman, and that he would be succeeded by Kenta Kobashi, following Kobashi's retirement as a professional wrestler on May 11, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/sports/fight/headlines/article/20130318-00000004-spnavi|title=小橋が古巣・全日本に登場　馳がPWF新会長に任命|work=Sports Navi|date=2013-03-18|accessdate=2013-03-17|publisher=[[Yahoo!]]|language=Japanese}}</ref>

==== Third exodus: Wrestle-1 ====
On May 1, 2013, it was reported that negotiations had started between Speed Partners president Nobuo Shiraishi and All Japan president Masayuki Uchida, which would see Keiji Mutoh regain the promotion's presidency before the end of the month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/138221/|script-title=ja:武藤が全日オーナー復職へ|work=[[Tokyo

==== Rebuilding ====
After the second exodus (along with the departures of ring announcer Makoto Abe and referees Daichi Murayama and Daisuke Kanbayashi), the promotion has now been reduced to less than half the active roster. On June 21, 2013, it was revealed that since 2009, AJPW mainstay [[Masanobu Fuchi]], who has been with the promotion since debuting in 1974, had long since resigned from the AJPW Board of Directors and has not been on an exclusive contract due to his age, thus becoming a freelancer, but chose to stay with AJPW on a pay per performance basis.<ref name=Cagematch>{{cite web|url=http://www.cagematch.net/?id=71&nr=5978|title=Update on AJPW's Personal Situation (German)}}</ref> On July 5, 2013, all five members of Burning (Akiyama, Shiozaki, Aoki, Suzuki, and Kanemaru) officially signed exclusive contracts with AJPW, ending their tenure as freelancers, along with the returns of Taiyo Kea and referee Kyohei Wada.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://battle-news.com/news/2013/07/001865.php | script-title=ja:全日本プロレスが新体制を発表し、バーニングが所属に！白石代表はガチンコ格闘プロレスの追求や全てにおいて合議制は崩さず | date=2013-07-05 | accessdate=2013-07-11 | work=Battle News | language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://sportsnavi.yahoo.co.jp/sports/fight/headlines/article/20130706-00000015-dal | script-title=ja:秋山13年ぶり！電撃"王道"復帰「全日本の名前の下に頑張りたい」 | date=2013-07-06 | accessdate=2013-07-11 | work=Sports Navi | publisher=[[Yahoo!]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> On July 14, during the launching event of the post-Mutoh All Japan, Masanobu Fuchi announced that he had officially re-signed with the promotion not only as a wrestler, but also as a member of the Board of Directors, ending his tenure as a freelancer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nikkansports.com/battle/news/f-bt-tp0-20130715-1157506.html | script-title=ja:渕正信、全日本に残留／全日本 | date=2013-07-15 | accessdate=2013-07-15 | work=[[Nikkan Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> On August 1, all of the All Japan shares were moved from Speed Partners to Shiraishi's Red Wall Japan corporation, which effectively became the new parent company of the promotion.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://battle-news.com/news/2013/08/001908.php | title = 全日本プロレスがPWF、UN、インターの3本のベルトを馬場家に返還すると発表！親会社もスピードパートナーズから変更に | date=2013-08-09 | accessdate=2013-08-09 | work=Battle News | language=Japanese}}</ref> Meanwhile, the promotion's corporate name was changed to "Zen Nihon Puroresu Systems".<ref name=AJPWKK/> On August 7, it was reported that All Japan had agreed to return the [[NWA International Heavyweight Championship|NWA International Heavyweight]], [[NWA United National Championship|NWA United National]] and [[PWF World Heavyweight Championship]] belts, which make up the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship, to Motoko Baba, the widow of the promotion's founder Giant Baba, bringing an end to the final remnant of the Giant Baba All Japan.
