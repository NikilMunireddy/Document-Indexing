The '''Australian Greens''' (commonly known as '''The Greens''') is an Australian [[Green politics|green political party]].

The party was formed in 1992 and is today a confederation of eight state and territory parties. In addition to environmentalism the party cites four core values: [[ecological sustainability]], [[social justice]], [[grassroots democracy]] and [[peace movement|peace and non-violence]].<ref name="themonthly.com.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/australian-greens-party-divided-we-fall-sally-neighbour-4524|title=The Australian Greens Party|work=The Monthly|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>

Party constituencies can be traced to various origins – notably the early [[environmental movement in Australia]] and the formation of the [[United Tasmania Group]] (UTG), one of the first [[Green party|green parties]] in the world,<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us|url=http://www.globalgreens.org/about-us|publisher=Global Greens|accessdate=19 December 2011}}</ref> but also the [[nuclear disarmament]] movement in Western Australia and sections of the industrial left in New South Wales. Co-ordination between environmentalist groups occurred in the 1980s with [[#Origins|various significant protests]]. Key people involved in these campaigns included [[Bob Brown]] and [[Christine Milne]] who went on to contest and win seats in the [[Tasmanian Parliament]] and eventually form the [[Tasmanian Greens]]; both Brown and Milne subsequently became leaders of the federal party.

Federally, the Greens have ten [[Australian Senate|senators]] and one member in the [[House of Representatives (Australia)|lower house]], 23 elected representatives in state and territory parliaments, more than 100 local councillors,<ref name="gc40">{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-03-23/greens-celebrate-40-years-of-movement/3909912 |title=Greens celebrate 40 years of movement |accessdate=6 July 2012 |date=24 March 2012 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}</ref> and over 13,000 party members (as of 2015).<ref name="bbog">{{Cite news|url=http://www.afr.com/opinion/editorials/di-natalie-dragging-greens-towards-reality-20160110-gm2wc5|title=Richard Di Natale dragging Greens towards reality|date=10 January 2016|publisher=Australian Financial Review|accessdate=11 January 2016}}</ref>

The Australian Greens are part of the global "[[green politics]]" movement. The charter of the Australian Greens identifies the following as the four pillars of the party's policy: "[[social justice]]", "[[sustainability]]", "[[grassroots democracy]]" and "[[peace]] and [[non-violence]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://greens.org.au/our-story |title=Our Story &#124; Australian Greens |publisher=Greens.org.au |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref> Major policy initiatives of recent years have also included taxation reform, review of the [[ANZUS|American alliance]],  implementation of harm minimisation in relation to drug use.

== History ==
{{Green politics sidebar}}

=== Origins ===
The formation of the Australian Greens in 1992 brought together over a dozen green groups, from state and local organisations, some of which had existed for 20 years.<ref name="themonthly.com.au"/>

The precursor to the Tasmanian Greens (the earliest existent member of the federation of parties that is the Australian Greens), the [[United Tasmania Group]], was founded in 1972 to oppose the construction of new dams to flood [[Lake Pedder]]. The campaign failed to prevent the flooding of Lake Pedder and the party failed to gain political representation. One of the party's candidates was [[Bob Brown]], then a doctor in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]].<ref>[http://www.bobbrown.org.au/assets/200_Senator_Bob_Brown.pdf Senator Bob Brown – Australian Greens] www.bobbrown.org.au (PDF file)</ref>

In the late 1970s and 1980s, a public campaign to prevent the construction of the [[Franklin Dam]] in Tasmania saw environmentalist and activist [[Norm Sanders]] elected to the [[Parliament of Tasmania|Tasmanian Parliament]] as an [[Australian Democrats|Australian Democrat]]. Brown, then director of the [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society|Wilderness Society]], contested the election as an independent, but failed to win a seat.<ref>[http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/tpl/Elections/e1982Den.htm Results in Denison for the election held on 15 May 1982], Tasmanian Parliamentary Library</ref>

In 1982 Norm Sanders resigned from Parliament, and Brown was elected to replace him on a countback<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prsa.org.au/tascava.htm |title=Proportional Representation Society of Australia |publisher=prsa.org.au |date=30 April 2012 |accessdate=9 May 2012}}</ref>

During her 1984 visit to Australia, [[German Greens|West German Greens]] parliamentarian [[Petra Kelly]] urged that the various Greens groups in Australia develop a national identity. Partly as a result of this, 50 Greens activists gathered in Tasmania in December to organise a national conference.<ref>[http://greens.org.au/aboutusfolder/ About us – The Greens], www.greens.org.au</ref>

The title "The Greens" had been first registered in Sydney in the 1980s by what ''The Monthly Magazine'' described as "a band of inner-city radicals committed to resident action, nuclear disarmament and urban environmental causes, such as stopping expressways and preserving parklands". The group formed as the Sydney Greens and evolved into the Green Alliance, with the stated aim of not forming a "traditional hierarchy party". According to party co-ordinator [[Hall Greenland]], when amalgamation with Bob Brown's Tasmanian movement was first mooted, Brown was hesitant owing to what he perceived as the "anarchic leftism" of the Sydney movement. New South Wales and Western Australian Green groups were also wary of amalgamation owing to local autonomy concerns and a 1986 attempt by Brown to form a national party failed. The movement for a national party continued however. In an effort to reduce the influence of the Democratic Socialist Party (formerly Socialist Workers Party) in the New South Wales Greens, Brown successfully moved for a ban on dual party membership by Greens. Following formation of the national party in 1992, regional emphasis variations remained within the Greens, with members of the "industrial left" remaining a presence in the New South Wales branch.<ref name="themonthly.com.au"/>

The Green movement gained its first federal parliamentary representative when Senator [[Josephine Vallentine|Jo Vallentine]] of Western Australia, who had been elected in 1984 for the [[Nuclear Disarmament Party]] and later sat as an independent, was part of the formation of and joined The Greens (WA), a party formed in Western Australia, and not affiliated to the Australian Greens at that time.

In 1992, representatives from around the nation gathered in North Sydney and agreed to form the Australian Greens, although the state Greens parties, particularly in Western Australia, retained their separate identities for a period. Brown resigned from the Tasmanian Parliament in 1993, and in 1996 he was elected as a senator for Tasmania, the first elected as an Australian Greens candidate.<ref>[http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/history/tasparl/brownr646.htm Bob Brown], The Parliament of Tasmania since 1856</ref>

Initially the most successful Greens group during this period was The Greens (WA), at that time still a separate organisation from the Australian Greens. Vallentine was succeeded by [[Christabel Chamarette]] in 1992, and she was joined by [[Dee Margetts]] in 1993. But Chamarette was defeated in [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996]]. Margetts opposed the industrial relations reform agenda of the [[Howard Government]]. Following the 'Cavalcade to Canberra' protest of 19 August 1996, in which 2000 breakaway civilians [[1996 Parliament House Riot|rioted in and around Parliament House]],<ref>Luke Deer [http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/interventions/riot.htm The Parliament House riot of 1996]. Retrieved 13 May 2012.</ref> Margetts told the Senate that "The Greens (WA) do not associate ourselves with the violent action" and that while "there are obviously some in the Greens movement who have differing opinions about that" she personally did not think there was "any justification for the use of violence to the extent that we saw".  Margetts lost her seat in the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 federal election]], leaving Brown as the sole Australian Greens senator.

=== Leadership of Bob Brown ===
[[File:Bob Brown at 2008 climate change rally DSC 6368.JPG|thumb|right|Bob Brown at a [[climate change]] rally in Melbourne on 5 July 2008]]
The national party initially resisted appointing a party leader, however Bob Brown was later selected. The New South Wales Greens remained ideologically opposed to appointing a leader and continue not to appoint such a position.<ref name="themonthly.com.au"/> The WA Greens had lost office in the Senate by 1998, leaving Bob Brown as the sole representative of the party. Thereafter, the national vote was set to increase consecutively at elections.<ref name="themonthly.com.au"/>{{Failed verification|date=September 2013}}

==== 2001 federal election onward ====
In the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 federal election]], Brown was re-elected as a senator for Tasmania, and a second Greens senator, [[Kerry Nettle]], was elected in New South Wales. The Greens opposed the [[Howard Government]]'s [[Pacific Solution]] of offshore processing for asylum seekers, and opposed the bipartisan offers of support to the [[ANZUS|US alliance]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]] by the government and [[Kim Beazley|Beazley Opposition]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September terrorist attacks]] in 2001, describing the Afghanistan commitment as "warmongering".<ref>Steve Letts [http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2001/s400997.htm PM explains Australian involvement in Afghan war]. [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] Lateline, 25 October 2001. Retrieved 13 May 2012.</ref> This contributed to increased support for the Greens by disaffected Labor voters and helped identify the Greens as more than just a single-issue environmental party. In 2002 the Greens won a [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] seat for the first time when [[Michael Organ]] won the [[Division of Cunningham|Cunningham]] [[Cunningham by-election, 2002|by-election]].

In the lead-up to the [[Iraq War]], in September 2002, Bob Brown said that the Greens would oppose military action in Iraq regardless of the position of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and said that any conflict would be "a vengeance for the S11 attack that's involved here as well as the American corporations wanting to get their hands on the Iraqi oil" and that if Saddam Hussein "does have weapons of mass destruction, the attack might be the thing that gets him to use them", so it would be better to "resolv[e] the Palestinian crisis, which could lead—open up a real avenue to peace in the Middle East, and neutralise Saddam Hussein by doing it".<ref>Tony Jones [http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s681477.htm Call for Howard to meet with Hussein]. [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] Lateline, 19 September 2002. Retrieved 13 May 2012.</ref>

==== 2004 federal election onward ====
In the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], the Greens' primary vote rose by 2.3% to 7.2%. This won them two additional Senate seats, taken by [[Christine Milne]] in Tasmania and [[Rachel Siewert]] in Western Australia, bringing the total to four. However, the success of the Howard Government in winning a majority in the Senate meant that the Greens' influence on legislation decreased. [[Michael Organ]] was defeated by Labor in Cunningham.

Additionally, in the 2004 election there was an intense media campaign from the socially conservative [[Family First Party]], including a television advertisement labelling the Greens the "Extreme Greens". Competitive preferencing strategies prompted by the nature of Senate balloting (see [[Australian electoral system]]) lead to the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats ranking Family First higher than the Greens on their Senate tickets, and the Greens losing preferences they would normally have received from the two parties. Consequently, although outpolling Family First by a ratio of more than four to one first-preference votes, Victorian Family First candidate [[Steve Fielding]] was elected on preferences over the Australian Greens' [[David Risstrom]], an unintended consequence of these strategies.<ref>"[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/10/1097406425742.html How party preferences picked Family First]", ''The Age'', 11 October 2004.</ref> In Tasmania, Christine Milne only narrowly gained her Senate seat before a Family First candidate, despite obtaining almost the full required quota of primary votes. It was only the high incidence of "below-the-line" voting in Tasmania that negated the effect of the preference-swap deal between Labor and Family First.<ref>"[http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=3359 Above or below the line? Managing preference votes]", ''On Line Opinion'', 20 April 2005</ref>

The Australian Greens fielded [[2004 Australian Greens candidates|candidates]] in every House of Representatives seat in Australia, and for all state and territory Senate positions. The Greens (WA) were able to win [[Members of the Western Australian Legislative Council, 2001–2005|Legislative Council]] seats in rural and remote-area seats (Mining and Pastoral, Agricultural and South West provinces).

In 2005, the Greens' [[Lee Rhiannon]] lobbied the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to reject Australian Cardinal [[George Pell]] as a candidate for the [[Papacy]] on the basis of his support for conservative Catholic moral doctrine. In 2007, Rhiannon referred remarks made by Pell opposing [[embryonic stem cell]] research to the New South Wales parliamentary privileges committee for allegedly being in "contempt of parliament". Pell was cleared of the charge and described the move as a "clumsy attempt to curb religious freedom and freedom of speech".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cathnews.acu.edu.au/706/83.php |title=Pell slams "stalinist" parliamentary contempt probe |publisher=Cathnews.acu.edu.au |date=18 June 2007 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/committee.nsf/0/73A134BD8CA52844CA2572FB0014E42B |title=Inquiry into comments made by Cardinal George Pell – NSW Parliament |publisher=Parliament.nsw.gov.au |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>

The Australian Greens' primary vote increased by 4.1% in the [[South Australian state election, 2006|2006 South Australia election]], 1.% in the [[Queensland state election, 2006|2006 Queensland election]], and 0.7% in the [[New South Wales state election, 2007|2007 election in New South Wales]].

The results for the [[Victorian state election, 2006|2006 Victoria state election]] were mixed, with an improved vote for the Greens in the lower house, but a fall in their upper-house vote.

Against this upward trend was a swing of 1.5% away from the Greens in the [[Tasmanian state election, 2006#Results|2006 election in Tasmania]].<ref>"[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/ ABC Coverage of Australian Elections]", Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 31 March 2007</ref>

On 31 August 2004, the Melbourne newspaper the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' published a page-three-story by journalist [[Gerard McManus]] entitled "Greens back illegal drugs" in the lead-up to the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]].  In response to the article, Brown lodged a complaint with the [[Australian Press Council]]. After the election, the Press Council upheld Brown's complaint. An appeal by the ''Herald Sun'' was dismissed and it was ordered to publish the Press Council's adjudication.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presscouncil.org.au/pcsite/adj/1270.html |title=Australian Press Council Adjudication No. 1270,&nbsp;February 2005 |publisher=Presscouncil.org.au |accessdate=16 June 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100623091820/http://www.presscouncil.org.au/pcsite/adj/1270.html| archivedate= 23 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>[http://vic.greens.org.au/content/media/home-page-articles/heraldsun/heraldsunguilty/ Herald Sun Found Guilty of Irresponsible Journalism and Seriously Misleading Readers], Press Releases, ''[[Victorian Greens]]'', 4 March 2005.

[[File:BobBrownSpeaking.jpg|right|thumb|Bob Brown lays out the Greens' climate change policies in the lead-up to the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]]]]
As in previous years, the Greens' vote was strongest in inner-city seats, including [[Division of Melbourne|Melbourne]] (22.7% of primary votes), [[Division of Sydney|Sydney]] (20.7%), [[Division of Grayndler|Grayndler]] (18.7%), [[Division of Denison|Denison]] (18.6%) and [[Division of Batman|Batman]] (17.2%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/13745/Website/Downloads/HouseDopByDivisionDownload-13745.csv |title=2007 Federal Election Results, Australian Electoral Commission |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref> Strong votes were also recorded in [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-held city based seats such as [[Division of Higgins|Higgins]] (10.8%), [[Division of Kooyong|Kooyong]] (11.8%) [[Division of Curtin|Curtin]] (13.4%) and [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]] (15.0%). The primary vote for the Greens in suburban and regional areas was generally smaller.

The Greens directly contributed to Howard's defeat in his own electorate, the Sydney-area seat of [[Division of Bennelong|Bennelong]].  Greens candidate Lindsay Peters received 5.5% of the primary vote.  He was eliminated after the 14th count, and more than three-fourths of his preferences went to Labor challenger [[Maxine McKew]].  This margin was enough to make McKew only the second person to unseat a sitting prime minister.

The Greens increased their national vote by 1.38 points to 9.04% at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]], with a net increase of one senator to a total of five. Senators [[Bob Brown]] (Tas) and [[Kerry Nettle]] (NSW) were up for re-election, Brown was re-elected, but Nettle was unsuccessful, becoming the only Australian Greens senator to lose their seat.

Other Greens Senate candidates were [[Larissa Waters]] (Qld), [[Richard Di Natale]] (Vic), [[Scott Ludlam]] (WA), [[Sarah Hanson-Young]] (SA) and [[Kerrie Tucker]] (ACT). Ludlam and Hanson-Young were elected and took up office on 26 August 2008 when all senators elected on 24 November 2007 were sworn in.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2007/results/senate/ |title=Senate Results |work=Federal Election 2007 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/Senate/pubs/daily/2008/260608.htm Parliament of Australia: Senate: Senate Daily Summary], No. 43/2008, 26 June 2008</ref>

This was also the first general election for the Greens in which a lower house seat went "maverick". In the [[Division of Melbourne]], the Greens polled 22.80% of the primary vote, overtaking the Liberals on preferences, finishing on a [[two-party-preferred vote|two-party-preferred]] figure of 45.29% against Labor.

An extensive campaign was undertaken in the ACT, in an attempt to end coalition control of the Senate immediately after the election, as territory senators take their place at this time as opposed to their state counterparts on the next 1 July. The ACT elects two seats with terms (in parallel with those of the House of Representatives), so a larger quota than normal is required for election. Despite a swing of 5.1 points to the Greens, on 21.5%, their best result in any state or territory, the party [[Senate results for the Australian federal election, 2007#Australian Capital Territory|fell significantly short]] of the required quota.

At the [[Northern Territory general election, 2008|2008 Northern Territory election]], the Greens ran in six of the 25 seats in the [[unicameral]] parliament, averaging 16% of the vote but won no seats. At the [[Western Australian state election, 2008|2008 Western Australian election]], the Greens won 11–12 percent of the statewide vote in both the lower and upper houses, with four of 36 seats in the latter, an increase of two.

In the [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008|2008 Australian Capital Territory election]], conducted under the [[Hare-Clark system]] of [[proportional representation]], the Greens doubled their vote to around 15%, going from one to four seats in the 17-member [[unicameral]] parliament, giving them the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. After almost two weeks of deliberations, the Greens chose to allow Labor to form a [[minority government]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.theage.com.au/national/labor-to-form-minority-government-in-act-20081031-5fea.html |title=Labor to form minority government in ACT: The Age 31/10/2008 |work=The Age |date=31 October 2008 |accessdate=16 June 2010 |location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Stockman |first=David |url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/political/greens-nod-sees-stanhope-keep-job/1349315.aspx |title=Greens' nod sees Stanhope keep job |work=The Canberra Times |date=1 November 2008 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://act.greens.org.au/documents/alp-greens-agreement.pdf |title=Labor-Greens parliamentary agreement PDF |format=PDF |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref> The Greens hold the post of Speaker in the [[ACT Legislative Assembly]], the first for a Green party in Australia.

In May 2009, the Greens won their second-ever single-member electorate, with [[Adele Carles]] winning the [[Fremantle state by-election, 2009|Fremantle by-election]] for the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]. The seat had been held by the Labor Party since 1924.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/17/2572630.htm WA Greens claim victory, make history], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], 17 May 2009</ref> It was the first time the Greens had outpolled the Labor Party on the primary vote in any Labor-held seat.<ref>{{cite news | author=Anthony Green | title=2009 Fremantle By-Election | date=16 May 2009 | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/wa/2009/fremantle/}}</ref>

In December 2009, the Greens received over 30 percent of the primary vote in the federal [[Higgins by-election, 2009|Higgins by-election]] in Victoria, in the absence of a Labor candidate. It is the highest primary vote recorded by the Greens in a Liberal-held lower-house seat.

At the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|March 2010 Tasmanian state election]], the Greens won 21.6 percent of the primary vote amongst the five multi-member electorates, resulting in the Greens winning five of twenty-five seats in the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|lower house]] and holding the balance of power. With Labor and the Liberals winning ten seats each, the Greens backed a Labor minority government. Tasmanian Greens Leader [[Nick McKim]] was appointed to the new Labor-Green cabinet, making him the first Green Minister in Australia.

In the lead-up to the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 Australian federal election]], the [[Australian Christian Lobby]] and the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney criticised Greens policies as "anti-Christian". In an 8 August opinion article for Sydney's ''Sunday Telegraph'' newspaper, Cardinal Archbishop [[George Pell]] wrote that the Greens were hostile to the family, opposed to religious schools, had pressured against Catholic management of Calvary Hospital in Canberra and said the party contained [[Stalinist]]s and a wing who were "watermelons" -"green on the outside, red on the inside" whose policies were  "impractical and expensive, which will not help the poor".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sydney.catholic.org.au/people/archbishop/stc/2010/201089_7.shtml |title=Catholic Archdiocese of Sydney – Our People |publisher=Sydney.catholic.org.au |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref> In response to the article, Senator Bob Brown said Pell was "bearing false witness" and that the Greens were in fact "much closer to mainstream Christian thinking than Cardinal Pell".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/greens-policies-more-christian-than-cardinal-geogre-pell-says-bob-brown/story-fn3dxity-1225902761740 |title=Greens' policies more Christian than Cardinal George Pell, says Bob Brown |work=The Australian |date=8 August 2010 |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref> [[Jesuit]] human rights lawyer Fr. [[Frank Brennan (Jesuit)|Frank Brennan]] responded in an essay by saying that that while some Greens might be anti-Christian, others like [[Lin Hatfield Dodds]] "have given distinguished public service in their churches for decades." On some policy issues, wrote Brennan, "the Greens have a more Christian message than the major parties", while on issues such as abortion, stem-cell research, same-sex marriage and funding for church schools, the party would never be able to "carry the day given that policy changes in these areas will occur only if they are supported by a majority from both major political parties".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=22755 |title=Why a conscientious Christian could vote for the Greens |publisher=Eureka Street |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref>

In the lead up to the 2010 election, Bob Brown opposed the senate pre-selection of high-profile New South Wales Green [[Lee Rhiannon]] in favour of environmentalist [[Cate Faehrmann]], saying that the Greens needed "new blood". Rhiannon, a socialist who had also campaigned on gun control, foreign aid, political donations and urban renewal said that there were differing visions for the future of the Greens – one of increased centralisation of party decision making versus a vision she supported of empowering membership. Rhiannon was confirmed as the candidate.<ref name="themonthly.com.au"/>

Milne took the leadership at a time when the Greens nationally had past a peak. In the 18 months between the high water mark of the 2010 Federal Election and Brown's retirement, polls nationally were trending downwards. This was reflected in a number of setbacks for state and local Greens parties, which some commentators blamed on Brown's absence. The outcome of 20 October 2012 election in the ACT resulted in a reduction of Greens Legislative Assembly members, from four to one.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rattenbury holds balance of power|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-10-27/final-act-election-count/4337186|accessdate=17 November 2012|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=27 October 2012}}</ref> The [[Western Australian state election, 2013|Western Australian state election]] was held in March 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2013/03/2013-wa-election-counting-nears-end.html |title=2013 WA Election – Counting Nears the End |author=Green, Antony |authorlink=Antony Green |date=15 March 2013 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC]] |accessdate=23 April 2013}}</ref> For the Legislative Assembly, the total primary vote for the Greens fell by 3.52% to 8.40%.

Nevertheless, Milne promised to continue to guarantee confidence and supply to the Labor Government on the floor of Parliament, so as not to "advance the interests" of Opposition Leader [[Tony Abbott]].<ref name="theaustralian.com.au">{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/greens-say-minority-government-agreement-with-labor-is-effectively-over/story-fn59niix-1226581102969 | work=The Australian | title=Greens say minority government agreement with Labor is effectively over | date=19 February 2013}}</ref>

Milne was aware that the period in balance of power would be electorally costly for the party, telling members that "You earn political capital in opposition and you spend it in power."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.themonthly.com.au/issue/2014/february/1391173200/guy-rundle/future-greens|title=The future of the Greens|work=The Monthly|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>  With that in mind, and following the disappointing state results, Milne and the Australian Greens set as their goal for the 2013 election a clear target of retaining their existing seats and perhaps win one more Senate seat in Victoria, rather than to increase the vote nationally.<ref name="smh.com.au"/> Despite a reduction in the vote, maintaining and slightly increasing parliamentary representation is exactly what Milne achieved.

=== Leadership of Richard Di Natale ===
[[Richard Di Natale]] became leader of the Australian Greens following [[Christine Milne]]'s resignation, on 6 May 2015.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-06/greens-elect-richard-di-natale-as-new-leader/6448948</ref>

Under Richard Di Natale, the party has taken a much more pragmatic approach to policy and dealing with government legislation than under previous leaders.<ref>http://www.afr.com/news/greens-pitch-for-the-centreleft-20160107-gm14xb</ref>

The party voted in support for legislation that saw assets testing for age pensions reduced from $1M down to $800,000.<ref>https://newmatilda.com/2015/06/23/why-greens-were-right-do-pension-deal-scott-morrison/</ref> The Greens also negotiated with the government and secured a tax disclosure threshold for big businesses earning more than $200M a year.

At the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]] the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (lower house) primary vote was 8.7 percent (−3.1) with the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] (upper house) primary vote at 8.7 percent (−4.5). Despite that, as targeted, the Greens representation in the parliament increased. [[Adam Bandt]] retained his [[Division of Melbourne|Melbourne]] seat with a primary vote of 42.6 percent (+7.0) and a [[Two-party-preferred vote|two-candidate preferred]] vote of 55.3 percent (−0.6). The Greens won four Senate positions, increasing their Senate representation from nine to ten Senators to take effect from 1 July 2014, to a total of eleven Green members in the [[Parliament of Australia]].

Writing in the [[Australian Financial Review]], Vincent Mahon, a former campaign manager for the Greens, said that while the Greens were able to present positive achievements to the electors relating to education, health, the environment and the promotion of clean energy, the party was unable to attract disenchanted Labor voters.  He noted that Green policies relating to carbon pricing and refugees were unpopular with many voters.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.afr.com/p/lifestyle/review/find_again_greens_lost_their_way_JLOzZt0AHpXe0xKm71wbBL | title=How the Greens lost their way – and how they can find it |author=Mahon, Vincent|date=7 November 2013|publisher=[[Australian Financial Review]] |accessdate=19 November 2013}}</ref> Christine Milne said that the Greens support of the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] minority government was a factor in the Greens' lower vote.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-29/greens-election-loss-christine-milne-labor/4987506 | title=Christine Milne says support for Labor minority government hurt Greens at election |date=30 September 2013|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref>

In September 2013, it was reported that six senior Greens' staffers had resigned including Chief of Staff, Ben Oquist, who claimed there were, "fundamental differences of opinion on strategy".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.crikey.com.au/2013/09/26/greens-staffer-exodus-supporters-round-behind-milne/   |author=Crook, Andrew | title=Greens staffer exodus?

At the [[Australian Senate special election in Western Australia, 2014|2014 Western Australian Senate election]] the Greens won in excess of a quota with the primary vote increasing from 9.5 to 15.6 percent, re-electing [[Scott Ludlam]].

== Structure ==
The Australian Greens, like all Australian political parties, is [[federalism|federally]] organised with separately registered state parties signing up to a national constitution, yet retaining considerable policy-making and organisational autonomy from the centre.<ref>Turnbull, N; Vromen, A. "[http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2004/09/turnbull_vromen.html Election 2004: Where do the Greens fit in Election 2004?]", ''Australian Review of Public Affairs'', 17 September 2004.</ref> The national decision-making body of the Australian Greens is the National Council, consisting of delegates from each member body (a state or territory Greens party). The National Council arrives at decisions by consensus. There is no formal executive of the national party. However, there is an Australian Greens Coordinating Group (AGCG) composed of national office bearers including the National Convenor, Secretary, Treasurer, and three members elected by National Council. There is also a Public Officer, a Party Agent and a Registered Officer.

A variety of working groups have been established by the National Council, which are directly accessible to all Greens members. Working groups perform an advisory function by developing policy, reviewing or developing the party structure, or by performing other tasks assigned by the National Council.

All policies originating from this structure are subject to ratification by the members of the Australian Greens.<ref>"[http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/sandgategreens/Organisational%20Framework%20of%20the%20Australian%20Greens.htm Organisational Framework of the Australian Greens]", ''Sandgate Branch of the Queensland Greens''.</ref>

On Saturday 12 November 2005 at the national conference in [[Hobart]] the Australian Greens abandoned their long-standing tradition of having no official leader and approved a process whereby a parliamentary leader could be elected by the Greens Parliamentary Party Room. On Monday 28 November 2005, Bob Brown – who had long been regarded as ''de facto'' leader by many inside the party, and most people outside the party – was elected unopposed as the Parliamentary Party Leader.<ref>"[http://www.abc.net.au/news/items/200511/1519245.htm?wa Greens firm up party structure]", ''[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'', 29 November 2005.</ref>

== Interactions with other political groups ==
The Greens do not have formal links to [[environmental organisation]]s commonly labelled by the media as "green groups" such as the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]], [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society|The Wilderness Society]] and [[Greenpeace]], all of whom claim to be non-partisan. However, it is common for the media to report the activities of such groups and those of The Greens under the general category of "greens". During elections, there is sometimes competition between The Greens and one or more of these groups negotiating "greens preferences" with other parties. The Greens preference negotiation objectives are to attempt to get Greens senators elected, and to get policy outcomes on issues like Tasmanian forests, though these objectives may be to a greater or lesser extent in conflict and the Greens more often direct preferences to Labor than the Liberals,<ref>"[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/guide/minorprefs.htm Minor Party Preferences", Australia Votes, Federal Election 2004], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 9 October 2004.</ref> but it is claimed that this did not affect federal election outcomes in 2001 and 2004.

=== Labor Party and unions ===
The Greens were in a formal alliance with the [[Australian Labor Party]] in the [[Tasmanian Parliament]] under the [[David Bartlett|Bartlett]] and [[Lara Giddings|Giddings]] governments between 2010 and 2014, and signed a formal agreement with the minority [[Gillard Government|Gillard Labor Government]] in the Federal [[Australian Parliament]] in 2010. Milne declared this agreement "effectively over" in February 2013, but said that the Greens would continue to support Labor in the Parliament.<ref name="theaustralian.com.au"/> Generally the Greens preference Labor ahead of the Coalition at elections.

Many Labor supporters and [[trade unionists]] see the Greens' policies as destructive of employment in industries like mining and forestry. The forestry industry has been a particular target of environmental campaigns and the [[CFMEU#Forestry and Furnishing Products Division|Forestry Division of the CFMEU]] have actively campaigned against the Greens. Left-wing trade unionists and some members of Labor's [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Left faction]] sympathise with the Greens' social policies and often identify more readily with the Greens than with the [[Labor Right]]. Some unionists, such as [[National Tertiary Education Union|NTEU]] and [[AMWU]] members have run for State or Federal parliament for the Greens. South Australian Labor MP, [[Kris Hanna]], defected to the Australian Greens in 2003 (before leaving the Greens in 2006, and being re-elected as an independent in the [[South Australian state election, 2006|2006 South Australian election]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200602/s1565530.htm |title=Hanna leaves Greens to run as independent |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=8 February 2006}}</ref> In 2008, Queensland Labor MP [[Ronan Lee]] defected to the Greens, becoming the first-ever Greens MP in the unicameral Queensland parliament. He said he made the decision after the Queensland government had "failed to act" against climate change. In 2015, the [[Electrical Trades Union of Australia]] (ETU) invited federal Greens MP [[Adam Bandt]] as a speaker at the ETU National Officers' Conference in [[Adelaide]] on account of their shared opposition to the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which was approved by both the [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] and [[Liberal Party of Australia|LNP]] .<ref name="ReferenceB">{{Cite web|title = Electrical Trades Union snubs Labor, asks Greens MP Adam Bandt to speak at conference|url = http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/electrical-trades-union-snubs-labor-asks-greens-mp-adam-bandt-to-speak-at-conference-20151116-gl0a18.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}</ref> [[Adam Bandt]] also spoke of the importance of "transition funding" to support workers and communities who would be affected by a transition from coal-fired power to renewable energy sources.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The Greens also announced Jim Casey, the [[NSW]] state secretary of the Fire Brigade Employees Union, as the candidate for the 2016 federal election in [[Grayndler]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Richard Di Natale announces local firefighter Jim Casey as Greens candidate for Grayndler|url = http://nsw.greens.org.au/news/nsw/richard-di-natale-announces-local-firefighter-jim-casey-greens-candidate-grayndler|website = Greens NSW|accessdate = 2015-12-05}}</ref>

However, these Green sympathies are not universal within Labor's Left and the two groups often find themselves competing in elections, making the Greens' growing popularity a threat to Labor.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/11/29/1038386307216.html |title=Greens clip Labor's left wing |first=Shaun |last=Carney |work=The Age |date=30 November 2002 |location=Melbourne}}</ref> In 2002, Labor front bencher and prominent Left member [[Lindsay Tanner]] wrote "The emergence of the Greens... is already hurting the ALP's ability to attract new members amongst young people."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/news/2002/02-02-05.shtml |title=If Not Now, When? |first=Lindsay |last=Tanner |date=5 February 2002 |publisher=AustralianPolitics.com}}</ref> During the 2004 campaign, Tanner's own seat of [[Division of Melbourne|Melbourne]] in Victoria was thought to be under serious threat by the Greens and he described Greens policies as "mad".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/04/1094234079670.html?from=storylhs&oneclick=true |title=Labor fighting to stop left's flight to Greens |work=The Age |date=4 September 2004 |first=Paul |last=Heinrichs |location=Melbourne}}</ref><ref>"[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/RB/2004-05/05rb13.htm Commonwealth Election 2004]", ''Parliamentary Library of Australia'', Research Brief no. 13; 14 March 2005</ref> In the end, Tanner held the seat comfortably on primary votes (51.78%, +4.35-point swing).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://results.aec.gov.au/12246/results/HouseDivisionFirstPrefs-12246-228.htm |title=VIC DIVISION – MELBOURNE |work=Virtual Tally Room – Election 2004 |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission}}</ref> He did not stand for election at the 2010 election and his seat was won by the Greens.

In the [[2006 Victorian state election]], there was increased bitterness between Labor and the Greens. Labor direct-mailed a letter from [[Peter Garrett]] to voters in its threatened inner-Melbourne seats claiming that the Greens were preferencing the Liberal Party, in spite of Greens preferences being either for Labor or being open.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Following the election, The Age's Paul Austin wrote "Labor's campaign manager, state secretary Stephen Newnham, reckons he knows why the Greens' support fell away in the last days of the campaign. He has told cabinet and caucus members it was because of Labor's loud assertions that the Greens had done a secret preferences deal with the Liberals".

In April 2007, ''[[The Age]]'' reported<ref>"[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/alp-rages-at-greens-nazi-joke/2007/04/01/1175366078761.html ALP rages at Greens Nazi joke]", ''The Age'', 2 April 2007</ref> that the Victorian Greens had published a poem titled ''The Battle of Jeff's Shed'', by Mike Puleston, describing ALP officials and volunteers who scrutinised vote counting after the state election as "the Labor Panzers and their hardened SS troops – SS stood for Sturm Scrutineers". The poem described the final vote count at the Melbourne Exhibition Centre, which finished about 4&nbsp;am on 14 December and resulted in the election of three Greens MLCs. Labor directed preferences in the upper house to the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]] above the Greens, which resulted in their preferences indirectly electing [[Peter Kavanagh (Australian politician)|Peter Kavanagh]] from DLP in [[Western Victoria Region]].

Prior to the 2010 Federal Election, the [[Electrical Trades Union of Australia|Electrical Trades Union]]'s Victorian branch donated $325,000 to the Greens' Victorian campaign – the largest political donation ever directed to the Party up to that time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/union-bankrolls-greens-20100817-128iu.html |title=Union bankrolls Greens |work=The Age |date=18 August 2010 |accessdate=1 February 2011 |location=Melbourne |first=Ben |last=Schneiders}}</ref>

In March 2011, division emerged within the Labor Party over Prime Minister Gillard's initial support for a Greens proposal to remove the commonwealth veto over Territory legislation.  [[Joe de Bruyn]], head of the Shop, Distributors and Allied Employees Association, said "Everybody in the federal parliament knows that this is simply a way of letting the territories into [[euthanasia]] or whatever else they want to do". Anti-euthanasia Labor senators called on Gillard to overturn Labor's support for the Greens plan and press reports said some Labor senators had complained that the issue had not been discussed in Cabinet.<ref>Dennis Shanahan & Matthew Franklin (3 March 2011), [http://www.perthnow.com.au/news/labor-revolt-on-gay-marriage/story-e6frg12c-1226015125271 Gillard faces Labor revolt on gay marriage]. perthnow.com.au.

=== The Coalition ===
Relations between the Greens and the Liberal-National Coalition are generally poor and the Greens usually direct voters to preference the Labor Party ahead of the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] or [[National Party of Australia|Nationals]] in Australian elections. The Coalition has however directed strategic preferences to the Greens over Labor in the past, as in the [[Division of Melbourne]], where [[Adam Bandt]] was elected at the [[2010 Australian Federal Election]] with Liberal Preferences. In addition, the Tasmanian Liberal Party under [[Tony Rundle]] managed to form a minority government through an informal alliance with the Tasmanian Greens between 1996 and 1998, enacting some progressive reforms in favour of forest conservation and LGBT rights during its term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/opinion/minority-rule-garnered-milestones-says-former-tasmanian-premier-tony-rundle/story-fnj4f64i-1226903769280|title=Minority rule garnered milestones, says former Tasmanian premier Tony Rundle|work=Mercury|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> At the 2010 Victorian State Election, the Liberals put their preference for the Greens below the Labor Party.

During the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] the Australian Greens were branded as "environmental extremists" and "fascists" by some members of the Liberal-National Coalition Government.<ref>Jennett, Greg.

They have a whole lot of other very, very kooky policies in relation to things like drugs and all of that sort of stuff".<ref>"[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2004/s1213412.htm Bob Brown unfazed by conservative attacks]", ''The World Today'', transcript, ABC radio, Tuesday, 5 October 2004.</ref>

Former Federal Conservation Minister [[Eric Abetz]] criticised former Australian Greens senators [[Bob Brown]] and [[Kerry Nettle]] for spending most of their time on non-environmental issues.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,19686847-7583,00.html Cut & paste: Who says the Green Left represents the environment?], ''[[The Australian]]'', 5 July 2006</ref>

In 2011, Liberal Shadow Cabinet frontbencher [[Kevin Andrews (Australian politician)|Kevin Andrews]] published a critique of the Greens policy agenda for [[Quadrant Magazine]] in which he wrote that the Greens' "objective involves a radical transformation of the culture that underpins Western civilisation" and that their agenda would threaten the "[[Judeo-Christian]]/[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] synthesis that upholds the individual" as well as "the economic system that has resulted in the creation of wealth and prosperity for the most people in human history."<ref>Kevin Andrews.

In December 2013, Liberal Party Treasurer [[Joe Hockey]] secured a deal with the Greens to remove the debt ceiling in response to debt approaching the current limit of $300b, despite opposition from the Labor Party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-04/government-strikes-deal-with-greens-to-scrap-debt-ceiling/5134972|title=Government strikes deal with Greens to scrap debt ceiling|work=ABC News|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> In December 2015, the Greens struck a deal with the Coalition Government, passing a law requiring multinational private companies with a turnover over $200 million to disclose their tax arrangements and also making it mandatory for multinational companies with a ''global'' turnover of $1 billion or more to have to prepare "general purpose" financial statements, which disclose greater tax details than previously occurred in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-12-03/coalition-and-greens-strike-deal-on-multi-national-tax-avoidance/6997328|title=Coalition and Greens strike deal on multinational tax avoidance|work=ABC News|date=3 December 2015|author=Susan McDonald & Chris Uhlmann}}</ref>

In a similar vein to the [[Family First Party|Family First]] television advertisements in 2004, [[Country Alliance]] also ran television advertisements<ref>"[http://www.countryalliance.org/videos.htm Television advertisement on Greens policies]", ''Country Alliance'', November 2006</ref> in the lead up to the 2006 Victorian state election claiming that the Greens policies were "extreme".

The Greens have voiced opposition and even organised protests against the [[One Nation Party]] (an anti-immigration, economically protectionist Party which enjoyed significant publicity in the 1998 Federal Election).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bob-brown.greensmps.org.au/content/media-release/greens-preferences-crucial-election-outcome-and-one-nations-chances |title=Greens Preferences crucial to Election Outcome and One Nation's Chances. &#124; Bob Brown |publisher=Bob-brown.greensmps.org.au |date=13 June 1998 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref>

== State and territory politics ==
The various [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states and territories]] have different [[Electoral systems of the Australian states and territories|electoral systems]], all of which allow the Greens to gain representation. In New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia, the Greens hold seats in the Legislative Councils (upper houses), which are elected by [[proportional representation]]. The Greens also hold a seat in the unicameral [[Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly]] since the 2012 election, down from four after the 2008 election. In Queensland and the [[Northern Territory]], their unicameral parliaments have made it difficult for the Greens to gain representation.

The Greens' most important area of state political activity has been in Tasmania, which is the only state where the lower house of the state parliament is elected by proportional representation. In Tasmania, the Greens have been represented in the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] from 1983, initially as Green Independents, and from the early 1990s as an established party. At the [[Tasmanian state election, 1989|1989 state election]], the Liberal Party won 17 seats to Labor's 13 and the Greens' 5. The Greens agreed to support a minority Labor government in exchange for a number of policy commitments. In 1992 the agreement broke down over the issue of employment in the forestry industry, and the premier, [[Michael Field (Australian politician)|Michael Field]], called an early state election which the Liberals won. Later, Labor and the Liberals combined to reduce the size of the Assembly from 35 to 25, thus raising the quota for election. At the [[Tasmanian state election, 1998|1998 election]] the Greens won only one seat, despite their vote only falling slightly, mainly due to the new electoral system. They recovered in the [[Tasmanian state election, 2002|2002 election]] when they won four seats. All four seats were retained in the [[Tasmanian state election, 2006|2006 election]]. After gaining 5 seats in the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010 election]], in April 2010 [[Nick McKim]] became the first Green Minister in Australia.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/04/21/2878717.htm ABC: Bartlett creates new post for Greens minister]. Retrieved 24 May 2010</ref>

In the [[New South Wales state election, 2011|2011 NSW State election]], the Greens claimed their first lower-house seat in the district of [[Electoral district of Balmain|Balmain]]. In the [[Victorian state election, 2014|2014 Victorian election]], they won two lower-house seats, those of [[Melbourne]] and [[Prahran]].

Three Greens have become ministers at the state/territory level: [[Nick McKim]] and [[Cassy O'Connor]] in Tasmania until 2014, and [[Shane Rattenbury]] in the [[Australian Capital Territory|ACT]] to the present.
