The '''Copa Libertadores de América''' ({{lang-pt|Copa Libertadores da América}}) is an annual international club [[association football|football]] competition organized by [[CONMEBOL]] since 1960. It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in Latin American football. The tournament is named in honor of the ''[[Libertadores]]'' (Spanish and Portuguese for ''liberators''), the main leaders of the [[South American wars of independence]],<ref name="Inicio" /> so a literal translation of its name into English would be "''Liberators of America Cup''".

It is sponsored by [[Bridgestone]] and is known as the '''Copa Bridgestone Libertadores'''. The competition has had several different formats over its lifetime. At the beginning, only the champions of the South American leagues participated. In 1966, the runners-up of the South American leagues began to join. In 1998, Mexican teams were invited to compete, and have contested regularly since 2000, when the tournament was expanded from 20 to 32 teams. Today at least three clubs per country compete in the tournament, while [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] each have five clubs participating. Traditionally, a group stage has always been used but the number of teams per group has varied several times.<ref name="Inicio" /><ref name="México" />

In the present format, the tournament consists of six stages, with the first stage taking place in early February. The six surviving teams from the first stage join 26 teams in the second stage, in which there are eight groups consisting of four teams each. The eight group winners and eight runners-up enter the final four stages, better known as the knockout stages, which ends with the finals anywhere between June and August. The winner of the Copa Libertadores becomes eligible to play in the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] and the [[Recopa Sudamericana]].<ref name="Reglamento" />

[[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] of Argentina are the most successful club in the cup's history, having won the tournament seven times. Argentine clubs have accumulated the most victories with 23 wins, while Brazil has the largest number of different winning teams, with a total of 10 clubs having won the title. The cup has been won by 24 different clubs, 12 of which have won the title more than once, and won consecutively by six clubs.<ref name="Boca Juniors 2001" /> The [[2015 Copa Libertadores Finals|defending champions]] were Argentine side [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]], who won their third title after beating [[Tigres UANL]] of [[Mexico]].

The clashes for the [[Copa Aldao|Copa Río de La Plata]] between the champions of Argentina and Uruguay kindled the idea of a continental competition in the 1930s.<ref name="Inicio" /> In 1948, the [[South American Championship of Champions]] ({{lang-es|link=no|Campeonato Sudamericano de Campeones}}), the most direct precursor to the Copa Libertadores, was played and organized by Chilean club [[Colo-Colo]] after years of planning and organization.<ref name="Inicio" /> Held in [[Santiago]], it brought together the champions of each nation's top national leagues.<ref name="Inicio" /> The tournament was won by [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] of [[Brazil]].<ref name="Inicio" /><ref>La Nación; Historia del Fútbol Chileno, 1985</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Esteban |last=Bekerman |year=2008 |url=http://www.perfil.com/contenidos/2008/03/13/noticia_0054.html |title=Hace 60 años, River perdía la gran chance de ser el primer club campeón de América |trans_title=60 years ago, River lost the chance to be the first club champion of America |editor=Perfil.com |accessdate=May 10, 2008 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

In 1958, the basis and format of the competition was created by [[C.A. Peñarol|Peñarol]]'s board leaders. On March 5, 1959, at the 24th South American Congress held in [[Buenos Aires]], the competition was approved by the International Affairs Committee. In 1966, it was named in honor of the [[Libertadores|heroes of South American liberation]], such as [[José Gervasio Artigas]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[José de San Martín]], [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]], and [[Simón Bolívar]], among others.<ref name="Inicio">{{cite web |url=http://historiayfutbol.obolog.com/copa-libertadores-america-25746 |title=¿Qué es la Copa Libertadores de América? |trans_title=What is the Copa Libertadore de América? |publisher=Historia y Fútbol |date=September 2, 2007 |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |first=Jose |last=Carluccio |language=Spanish }}</ref>

=== Beginnings: 1960–1969 ===
The first edition of the Copa Libertadores took place in [[1960 Copa Libertadores|1960]]. Seven teams participated: [[Esporte Clube Bahia|Bahia]] of Brazil, [[Club Jorge Wilstermann|Jorge Wilstermann]] of Bolivia, [[Club Deportivo Los Millonarios|Millonarios]] of Colombia, [[Club Olimpia|Olimpia]] of Paraguay, [[C.A. Peñarol|Peñarol]] of Uruguay, [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] of Argentina and [[C.F. Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]]. All these teams were domestic champions of their respective leagues in 1959. The first Copa Libertadores match took place on April 19, 1960. It was won by Peñarol, who defeated Jorge Wilstermann 7–1. The first goal in Copa Libertadores history was scored by [[Carlos Borges]] of Peñarol. The Uruguayans won the first ever edition, defeating Olimpia in the finals, and successfully defended the title in [[1961 Copa Libertadores|1961]].<ref name="Peñarol">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=1882532/ |title= Peñarol: Spencer secures Peñarol’s place in the pantheon |publisher=[[FIFA]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010}}</ref> The Copa Libertadores did not receive international attention until its third edition, when the sublime football of a [[Santos FC|Santos]] team led by [[Pelé]], considered by some the best club team of all time, earned worldwide admiration.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cunha |first=Odir |title=Time dos Sonhos |trans_title=Dream Teams |year=2003 | isbn =85-7594-020-1 |language=Portuguese }}</ref> ''[[Os Santásticos]]'', also known as ''O Balé Branco'' (the white ballet) won the title in [[1962 Copa Libertadores|1962]] defeating defending champions Peñarol in the finals.<ref name="Santos">{{cite web |url=http://www.santosfc.com.br/historia/default.asp?id=18033&c=Hist%F3ria&st=T%EDtulos |title=Principais Troféus |trans_title=Major Trophies |publisher=[[Santos FC]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> [[1963 Copa Libertadores|A year later]], ''O Rei'' and his compatriot [[Coutinho]] demonstrated their skills again in the form of tricks, dribbles, backheels, and goals including two in the second leg of the final at [[Estadio Alberto J.

=== Argentine decade: 1970–1979 ===

[[File:Estudiantes 1968.jpg|thumb|right|A formation of the [[Estudiantes de La Plata]] team that won the title in [[1968 Copa Libertadores|1968]], [[1969 Copa Libertadores|1969]] and [[1970 Copa Libertadores|1970]].]]
The 1970s were dominated by Argentine clubs, with the exception of three seasons. In a rematch of the 1969 finals, Nacional emerged as the champions of the [[1971 Copa Libertadores|1971]] tournament after overcoming an Estudiantes squad depleted of key players.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/sacups/copa71.html |title=Copa Libertadores de América 1971 |publisher=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] |accessdate=May 19, 2010 |first=José Luis |last=Pierrend }}</ref> With two titles already under their belt, Independiente created a winning formula with the likes of [[Francisco Sa]], [[José Omar Pastoriza]], [[Ricardo Bochini]] and [[Daniel Bertoni]]: pillars of the titles of [[1972 Copa Libertadores|1972]], [[1973 Copa Libertadores|1973]], [[1974 Copa Libertadores|1974]], and [[1975 Copa Libertadores|1975]].<ref name="Independiente" /> Independiente's home stadium, [[Estadio Libertadores de América|La Doble Visera]], became one of the most dreaded venues for visiting teams to play at.<ref>{{cite book |last=Geraldes |first=Pablo Aro | title=Independiente, El campeón |trans_title=Independiente, the champion |publisher=Atlántida |year=1979 |language=Spanish }}</ref> The first of these titles came in 1972 when Independiente came up against [[Universitario de Deportes]] of Peru in the finals. Universitario became the first team from the Pacific coast to reach the finals after eliminating Uruguayan giants [[C.A. Peñarol|Peñarol]] and defending champions Nacional at the semifinal stage. The first leg in [[Lima]] ended in a 0–0 tie, while the second leg in [[Avellaneda]] finished 2–1 in favor of the home team. Independiente successfully defended the title a year later against Colo-Colo after winning the playoff match 2–1. ''Los Diablos Rojos'' retained the trophy in 1974 after defeating [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] 1–0 in a hard-fought playoff. In 1975, [[Unión Española]] also failed to dethrone the champions in the finals after losing the playoff 2–0.

The reign of ''Los Diablos Rojos'' finally ended in [[1976 Copa Libertadores|1976]] when they were defeated by fellow Argentine club River Plate in the second phase in a dramatic playoff for a place in the finals. However, in the finals River Plate themselves would be beaten by [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]] of Brazil, which was the first victory by a Brazilian club in 13 years.<ref name="Cruzeiro">{{cite web |url=http://www.cruzeiro.com.br/index2.php?section=historia_titulospro&idm=3 |title=Relação dos Títulos oficiais do Cruzeiro |trans_title=List of official Cruzeiro titles |publisher=[[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]] |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |language=Portuguese }}</ref>

After having the trophy elude them in 1963 at the hands of Pelé's Santos, Boca Juniors finally managed to appear on the continental football map. Towards the end of the decade, the ''Xeneizes'' reached the finals in three consecutive years. The first was in [[1977 Copa Libertadores|1977]] in which Boca earned their first victory against defending champions Cruzeiro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/el-club/titulos#1977_libertadores |title=Copa Libertadores de América: 1977 |publisher=[[Boca Juniors]] |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |language=Spanish}}</ref> After both teams won their home legs 1–0, a playoff at a neutral venue was chosen to break the tie.

===Pacific emergence and last Uruguayan triumphs: 1980–1989===

Nine years after their first triumph, Nacional won their second cup in [[1980 Copa Libertadores|1980]] after overcoming [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]]. Despite Brazil's strong status as a football power in South America, [[1981 Copa Libertadores|1981]] marked only the fourth title won by a Brazilian club. [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], led by stars such as [[Zico]], [[Leovegildo Lins da Gama Júnior|Júnior]], [[José Leandro Ferreira|Leandro]], [[Adílio de Oliveira Gonçalves|Adílio]], [[Nunes (footballer)|Nunes]], [[Cláudio Adão]], [[Milton Queiroz da Paixão|Tita]] and [[Paulo César Carpegiani|Carpegiani]], sparkled as the ''Mengão's'' [[Golden Generation]] reached the pinnacle of their careers by beating [[Cobreloa]] of Chile.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vaz |first=Arturo |title=Acima de Tudo Rubro-Negro |trans_title=Above All Rubro-Negro |publisher=A História do C.

In the final, they repeated the feat, beating Cobreloa in a decisive second leg match 1–0 in Santiago. [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] of [[Porto Alegre]] made history by defeating Peñarol to become the champion in [[1983 Copa Libertadores|1983]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gremio.net/page/view.aspx?i=libert_1983&language=0 |title=1983 – Libertadores |publisher=[[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> In [[1984 Copa Libertadores|1984]], Independiente won their seventh cup, a record that stands today, after defeating title holders Grêmio in a final which included a 1–0 win in the first away leg, highlighting [[Jorge Burruchaga]] and a veteran [[Ricardo Bochini]].<ref name="Independiente" />

Another team rose from the Pacific, as had Cobreloa. Colombian club [[América de Cali|América]] reached three consecutive finals in [[1985 Copa Libertadores|1985]], [[1986 Copa Libertadores|1986]] and [[1987 Copa Libertadores|1987]] but like Cobreloa they could not manage to win a single one. In 1985, [[Argentinos Juniors]], a small club from the neighborhood of [[La Paternal]] in Buenos Aires, astonished South America by eliminating holders Independiente in La Doble Visera 2–1 during the last decisive match of the second round, to book a place in the final. Argentinos Juniors went on to win an unprecedented title by beating America de Cali in the play-off match via a penalty shootout.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argentinosjuniors.com.ar/titulos_obtenidos.php?cual=libertadores |title=Campeón Copa Libertadores de América / 1985 |trans_title=Copa Libertadores de America Champion / 1985 |publisher=[[Argentinos Juniors]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |language=Spanish}}</ref> After the frustrations of 1966 and 1976, River Plate reached a third final in 1986 and were crowned champions for the first time ever after winning both legs of the final series against America de Cali, 2–1 at the [[Estadio Pascual Guerrero]] and 1–0 at [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elgrafico.com.ar/coberturas-historicas/1986-river-gana-la-copa-libertadores-detalle.php |title=River gana la Copa Libertadores |trans_title=River wins the Copa Libertadores |publisher=[[El Gráfico]] |date=November 4, 1986|accessdate=May 18, 2010 |first= José Luis |last=Barrio |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cariverplate.com.ar/pop.php?cat=pops&url=copalibertadores86.php |title=Copa Libertadores del 86 |trans_title=1986 Copa Libertadores |publisher=[[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070821121008/http://www.cariverplate.com.ar/pop.php?cat=pops&url=copalibertadores86.php |archivedate=August 21, 2007 |language=Spanish}}</ref> Peñarol won the Cup again in 1987 after beating America de Cali 2–1 in the decisive playoff;<ref name="Peñarol" /> it proved to be their last hurrah in the international scene as Uruguayan football, in general, suffered a great decline at the end of the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uruguaynow.com/uruguayan_football.php |title=Football, football, football |publisher=UruguayNow |accessdate=May 19, 2010}}</ref> The ''Manyas'' fierce rivals, Nacional, also won one last cup in [[1988 Copa Libertadores|1988]] before falling from the continental limelight.

It was not until [[1989 Copa Libertadores|1989]] that a Pacific team finally broke the dominance of the established Atlantic powers. [[Atlético Nacional]] of [[Medellín]] won the final series, thus becoming the first team from [[Colombia]] to win the tournament. Atletico Nacional faced off against Olimpia losing the first leg in [[Asunción]] 2–0. Because [[Estadio Atanasio Girardot]], their home stadium, did not have the minimum capacity CONMEBOL required to host a final, the second leg was played in Bogota's [[Estadio El Campín|El Campín]] with the match ending 2–0 in favor of Atletico Nacional. Having tied the series, Atletico Nacional become that year's champions after winning a penalty shootout which required four rounds of [[Sudden death (sport)|sudden death]].<ref name="1989AN">{{cite web |url=http://www.atlnacional.com.co/mk/index.php?pid=1 |title=Palmarés |trans_title=Titles |publisher=[[Atlético Nacional]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |language=Spanish}}</ref> Goalkeeper [[René Higuita]] cemented his legendary status with an outstanding performance as he stopped four of the nine Paraguayan kicks and scored one himself.<ref>{{cite book |title=Atlético Nacional, Rey de Copas |trans_title=Atlético Nacional, King of Cups |page=104 |publisher=Periodico El Colombiano, Medellín, Colombia |year=2004 |isbn=958-693-696-1 |language=Spanish}}</ref> The 1989 edition also had another significant first: it was the first ever time that no club from Argentina, Uruguay, or Brazil managed to reach the final. That trend would continue until 1992.

=== Renaissance: 1990–1999 ===
Having led Olimpia to the 1979 title as manager, [[Luis Cubilla]] returned to the club in 1988. With the legendary goalkeeper [[Ever Hugo Almeida]], [[Gabriel González (Paraguayan footballer)|Gabriel González]], [[Adriano Samaniego]], and star [[Raul Vicente Amarilla]], a rejuvenated ''decano'' boasted a formidable side that promised a return to the glory days of the late 1970s. After coming up short in 1989 against Atlético Nacional, Olimpia reached the [[1990 Copa Libertadores]] finals after defeating the defending champion in a climactic semifinal series decided on penalties. In the finals, Olimpia defeated [[Barcelona Sporting Club|Barcelona]] of Ecuador 3–1 in aggregate in a relatively comfortable victory to win their second title.<ref name="Olimpia" /> Olimpia reached the [[1991 Copa Libertadores]] finals, once again, defeating Atlético Nacional in the semifinals and facing [[Colo-Colo]] of Chile in the final. Led by [[Yugoslavia]]n coach [[Mirko Jozić]], the Chilean squad beat the defending champion 3–0. The defeat brought Olimpia's second golden era to a close.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.colocolo.cl/el-club/ |title=El Club |publisher=[[Colo-Colo]] |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |language=Spanish }}</ref>

In [[1992 Copa Libertadores|1992]], [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] rose from being a mere great in Brazil to become an international powerhouse. Manager [[Telê Santana]] turned to the ''Paulistas''' youth and instilled his style of quick, cheerful, and decisive football. Led by stars such as [[Zetti]], [[Müller (footballer)|Müller]], [[Raí]], [[Cafu]], [[Palhinha (Jorge Ferreira da Silva)|Palhinha]], São Paulo beat [[Newell's Old Boys]] of Argentina to begin a dynasty.<ref name="São Paulo FC">{{cite web |url=http://saopaulofc.net/spfcpedia/conquistas/ |title=El Club |publisher=[[São Paulo Futebol Clube]] |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |language=Portuguese }}</ref> In [[1993 Copa Libertadores|1993]] São Paulo successfully defended the title by thumping [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Católica]] of Chile in the finals.<ref name="São Paulo FC" /> The Brazilian side became the first club since Boca Juniors in 1978 to win 2 consecutive Copa Libertadores. Like Boca Juniors, however, they would reach another final in [[1994 Copa Libertadores|1994]] only to lose the title to [[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] of Argentina in a penalty shoot-out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.velezsarsfield.com.ar/futbol/titulos/ |title=Títulos |trans_title=Titles |publisher=[[Club Atlético Vélez Sársfield|Vélez Sársfield]] |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

With a highly-compact tactical lineup and the goals of the formidable duo [[Mário Jardel|Jardel]] and [[Paulo Nunes]], Grêmio won the coveted trophy again in [[1995 Copa Libertadores|1995]] after beating an Atlético Nacional led, once again, by the iconic figure of René Higuita.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gremio.net/page/view.aspx?i=libert_1995&language=0 |title=1995 – Libertadores |publisher=[[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |language=Portuguese}}</ref> Jardel finished the season as top scorer with 12 goals. The team coached by [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] was led by defender (and [[captain (association football)|captain]]) [[Adilson]] and the skilful midfielder [[Arilson]]. In the [[1996 Copa Libertadores|1996]] season, figures such as [[Hernán Crespo]], [[Matías Almeyda]] and [[Enzo Francescoli]] helped River Plate secure its second title after defeating América de Cali in a rematch of the 1986 final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cariverplate.com.ar/pop.php?cat=pops&url=copalibertadores96.php |title=Copa Libertadores del 96 |trans_title=1996 Copa Libertadores |publisher=[[Club Atlético River Plate]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070821120955/http://www.cariverplate.com.ar/pop.php?cat=pops&url=copalibertadores96.php |archivedate=August 21, 2007 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

The Copa Libertadores stayed on Brazilian soil for the remainder of the 1990s as Cruzeiro, Vasco da Gama and Palmeiras took the spoils. The cup of [[1997 Copa Libertadores|1997]] pitted Cruzeiro against Peruvian club [[Sporting Cristal]]. The key breakthrough came in the second leg of the final when Cruzeiro broke the deadlock with just under 15 minutes left in a match attended by over 106,000 spectators in the [[Mineirão]].<ref name="Cruzeiro" /> Vasco da Gama defeated Barcelona SC with ease to record their first title in [[1998 Copa Libertadores|1998]]. The decade ended on a high note when Palmeiras and Deportivo Cali, both runners-up in the competition before, vied to become winners for the first time in [[1999 Copa Libertadores|1999]]. The final was a dramatic back-and-forth match that went into penalties. Luiz Felipe Scolari managed to lead yet another club to victory as the ''Verdão'' won 4–3 in São Paulo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/campeonatos/libertadores/ultimas-noticias/2009/07/16/ult7249u614.jhtm |title=Há 10 anos, times brasileiros não são campeões diante de estrangeiros |trans_title=For 10 years, Brazilian clubs have not been champion in front of strangers |publisher=UOL Esporte |date=July 16, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2010 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.palmeiras.com.br/conteudo/?categoria=T%EDtulos&menu=Hist%F3ria |title=Galeria de Títulos |trans_title=Gallery of Titles |publisher=[[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras]] |accessdate=May 21, 2010 |language=Portuguese }}</ref>

This decade proved to be a major turning point in the history of the competition as the Copa Libertadores went through a great deal of growth and change. Having long been dominated by teams from Argentina, Brazil began to overshadow their neighbors as their clubs reached eight finals and won six titles in the 1990s.<ref name="Estudiantes" />

From 1998 onwards, the Copa Libertadores was sponsored by [[Toyota Motor Corporation|Toyota]] and became known as the ''Copa Toyota Libertadores''.<ref name="Santander" /> That same year, Mexican clubs, although affiliated to [[CONCACAF]], started taking part in the competition thanks to quotas obtained from the ''Pre-Libertadores'' which pitted Mexican and Venezuelan clubs against each other for two slots in the group stage.<ref name="México" /> The tournament was expanded to 36 teams and economic incentives were introduced by an agreement between CONMEBOL and Toyota Motor Corporation.<ref name="Santander" /> All teams that advanced to the second stage of the tournament received $25,000 for their participation.<ref name="Prize">{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20070928/pags/20070928170447.html |title=Football Cup Primer: The Copa Libertadores |publisher=Avoiding the Drop |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |first=Magnakai |last=Haaskivi }}</ref>

=== Decade of resurgences: 2000–2009 ===

During the [[2000 Copa Libertadores]], Boca Juniors returned to the top of the continent and raised the Copa Libertadores again after 22 years. Led by [[Carlos Bianchi]], the ''Virrey'', along with outstanding players like [[Mauricio Serna]], [[Jorge Bermúdez]], [[Óscar Córdoba]], [[Juan Roman Riquelme]], and [[Martín Palermo]], among others, revitalized the club to establish it among the world's best.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&pg=PA196&dq=best+club+teams+in+the+world+soccer#v=onepage&q=best%20club%20teams%20in%20the%20world%20soccer&f=false |title=The Global Art of Soccer |publisher=Richard Witzig |accessdate=May 20, 2010 }}</ref> The ''Xeneizes'' started this legacy by defeating defending champion Palmeiras in the final series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/el-club/titulos#2000_libertadores |title=Copa Libertadores de América: 2000 |publisher=[[Boca Juniors]] |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |language=Spanish}}</ref> Boca Juniors won the [[2001 Copa Libertadores|2001]] edition after, once again, defeating Palmeiras in the semifinals and [[Cruz Azul]] in the final series to successfully defend the trophy.<ref name="Boca Juniors 2001">{{cite web |url=http://www.historiadeboca.com.ar/campanias.asp?tfAnio=2001&tfTipoTorneo=109 |title=Copa Libertadores 2001 |publisher=Historia de Boca |accessdate=May 19, 2010 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/el-club/titulos#2001_libertadores |title=Copa Libertadores de América: 2001 |publisher=[[Boca Juniors]] |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |language=Spanish }}</ref> Cruz Azul became the first ever Mexican club to reach the final after great performances against River Plate and an inspired [[Rosario Central]]. Like their predecessors from the late 1970s however, Boca Juniors would fall short of winning three consecutive titles. As with [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]]'s men, the ''Xeneizes'' became frustrated as they were eliminated by Olimpia, this time during the quarterfinals. Led by [[1986 FIFA World Cup|World Cup winner]]-turned manager [[Nery Pumpido]], Olimpia would overcome Grêmio (after some controversy) and surprise finalists [[Associação Desportiva São Caetano|São Caetano]].<ref name="Olimpia" /> Despite this triumph, Olimpia did not create the winning mystique of its past golden generations and bowed out in the round of 16 the following season, after being routed by Grêmio 6–2, avenging their controversial loss from the year before.

The [[2003 Copa Libertadores|2003 tournament]] became an exceptional show as many teams such as América de Cali, River Plate, Grêmio, Cobreloa, and Racing, among others, brought their best sides in generations and unexpected teams such as [[Independiente Medellín]] and [[Paysandu Sport Club|Paysandu]] became revelations in what was, arguably, the best Copa Libertadores in history.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/3830015.stm |title=Copa Libertadores runs dry |publisher=BBC |date=June 22, 2009 |accessdate=May 19, 2010 |first=Tim |last=Vickery }}</ref> The biggest news of the competition was previous champion Santos.

Boca Juniors once again found talent in their ranks to fill the gap left by the very successful group of 2000–2001 (with upcoming stars [[Rolando Schiavi]], [[Roberto Abbondanzieri]] and [[Carlos Tevez]]).

In [[2008 Copa Libertadores|2008]] the tournament severed its relationship with Toyota.

In 2010, a spell of the competition only being won by Brazilian clubs for four years began with [[SC Internacional|Internacional]] defeating [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara|Guadalajara]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internacional.com.br/pagina.php?modulo=2&setor=18&codigo=12052|title=Inter é bicampeão da América!|work=Internacional|date=August 18, 2010|language=pt|accessdate=August 18, 2010}}</ref> In 2011, [[Santos FC|Santos]] won their third Copa, overcoming [[Peñarol]] by 2–1 in the final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/esportes,santos-e-campeao-da-libertadores-2011,735944,0.htm|title=Santos é campeão da Libertadores 2011|work=www.estadao.com.br|date=June 23, 2011|language=pt|accessdate=June 23, 2011}}</ref> In 2012, [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] won the tournament undefeated, beating [[Boca Juniors]] 2–0 in the final.

=== Argentine comeback: 2014– ===

The Brazilian spell ended with [[Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo's]] first title, beating [[Club Nacional|Nacional]] of Paraguay in the finals. But another trend was born, as once again a new champion was crowned, for the third consecutive year. San Lorenzo's victory was then followed by another Argentine club's victory, River Plate, winning its third title on 2015.

== Format ==

=== Qualification ===
Most teams qualify for the Copa Libertadores by winning half-year tournaments called the [[Apertura and Clausura]] tournaments or by finishing among the top teams in their championship.<ref name="Reglamento" /> The countries that use this format are Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Venezuela.<ref name="Reglamento" /> Peru and Ecuador have developed new formats for qualification to the Copa Libertadores involving several stages.<ref name="Reglamento" /> Brazil is the only South American league to use a European league format instead of the Apertura and Clausura format.<ref name="Reglamento" /> However, one berth for the Copa Libertadores can be won by winning the [[Copa do Brasil]].<ref name="Reglamento" />

Peru, Uruguay and Mexico formerly used a second tournament to decide qualification for the Libertadores (the "Liguilla Pre-Libertadores" between 1992 and 1997, the "Liguilla Pre-Libertadores de América" since 1974 to 2009, and the [[InterLiga]] from 2004 to 2010, respectively).<ref name="México">{{cite web |url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=82978 |title=River y Colón no tienen fecha fija |trans_title=River and Colón do not have a date set |publisher=[[La Nación]] |date=December 13, 1997 |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref name="Reglamento" /> Chile still uses a competition to determine a Copa Libertadores participant, the "Liguilla para Copa Libertadores". Argentina used an analogous method only once in [[1991–92 Argentine Primera División|1992]]. Since 2011, the winner of the Copa Sudamericana has qualified automatically for the following Copa Libertadores.<ref name="Reglamento" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conmebol.com/conmebol/mainMedia.html?id=15171&viewpage=%27full%27 |title=Magnífico sorteo de la Copa Nissan Sudamericana 2010 en Asunción |trans_title=Magnificent draw for the 2010 Copa Nissan Sudamericana in Asunción |publisher=[[CONMEBOL]] |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=May 18, 2010 |language=Spanish |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100502235115/http://www.conmebol.com/conmebol/mainMedia.html?id=15171&amp;viewpage='full' <!--Added by H3llBot--> |archivedate=May 2, 2010}}</ref>

The winners of the previous season's Copa Libertadores are given an additional entry if they do not qualify for the tournament through their domestic performance; however, if the title holders qualify for the tournament through their domestic performance, an additional entry is granted to the next eligible team, "replacing" the title holder.

If the winners of the Copa Sudamericana do not qualify for the tournament through their domestic performance, this entry will come at the expense of the last-placed team of their association.

Unlike most other competitions around the world, the Copa Libertadores historically did not use [[extra time]], an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a tie or draw, or [[away goals rule|away goals]], a method of [[tiebreaker|breaking ties]] in football and other sports when teams play each other twice, once at each team's home ground, to decide a tie that was level on aggregate.<ref name="Reglamento" /> From 1960 to 1987, two-legged ties were decided on points (teams would be awarded 2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss), without taking goal difference into consideration. If both teams were level on points after two legs, a third match would be played at a neutral venue. Goal difference would only come into play if the third match was drawn. If the third match did not produce an immediate winner, a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] was used to determine a winner.<ref name="Reglamento" />

From 1988 onwards, two-legged ties were decided on points, followed by goal difference, with an immediate penalty shootout if the tie was level on aggregate after full-time in the second leg.<ref name="Reglamento" /> Starting with the 2005 season, CONMEBOL began to use the away goals rule.<ref name="Reglamento" /> In 2008, the finals became an exception to the away goals rule and employed extra time.<ref name="Reglamento" /> From 1995 onwards, the "[[Three points for a win]]" standard, a system adopted by FIFA in 1995 that places additional value on wins, was adopted in CONMEBOL, with teams now earning 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss.

=== Tournament ===
The current tournament features 38 clubs competing over a six- to eight-month period. There are three stages: the first stage, the second stage and the knockout stage.

The first stage involves 12 clubs in a series of two-legged knockout ties.<ref name="Reglamento" /> The six survivors join 26 clubs in the second stage, in which they are divided into eight groups of four.<ref name="Reglamento" /> The teams in each group play in a double round-robin format, with each team playing home and away games against every other team in their group.<ref name="Reglamento" /> The top two teams from each group are then drawn into the knockout stage, which consists of two-legged knockout ties.<ref name="Reglamento" /> From that point, the competition proceeds with two-legged knockout ties to quarterfinals, semifinals, and the finals.<ref name="Reglamento" /> Between 1960 and 1987 the previous winners did not enter the competition until the semifinal stage, making it much easier to retain the cup.<ref name="Reglamento" />

Between 1960 and 2004, the winner of the tournament participated for the now-defunct [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] or (after 1980) Toyota Cup, a football competition endorsed by [[UEFA]] and CONMEBOL, contested against the winners of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] (since renamed the UEFA Champions League)<ref name="Reglamento" /> Since 2004, the winner has played in the [[FIFA Club World Cup|Club World Cup]], an international competition contested by the champion clubs from all six continental confederations.

The [[pedestal]], which contains badges from every winner of the competition, is made of [[Plywood#Hardwood plywood|hardwood plywood]]. The badges show the season, the full name of the winning club, and the city and nation from which the champions hail. To the left of that information is the club logo. Any club which wins three consecutive tournaments has the right to keep the trophy. Today, the current trophy is the third in the history of the competition.

The Copa Libertadores occupies an important space in South American culture. The folklore, fanfare, and organization of many competitions around the world owe its aspects to the ''Libertadores''.

===The "Sueño Libertador"===
The ''Sueño Libertador'' is a promotional Spanish [[phrase]] used in the context of winning or attempting to win the Copa Libertadores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsiglodedurango.com.mx/noticia/23364.siglo |title=Sueño Libertador |trans_title=Liberator Dream |publisher=El Siglo de Durango |language=Spanish |date=January 16, 2004 |accessdate=May 18, 2010  |first=Arturo Brizio |last=Carter }}</ref> Thus, when a team gets eliminated from the competition, it is said that the team has awakened from the liberator dream. The project normally starts after the club win one's national league (which grants them the right to compete in the following year's Copa Libertadores).

It is common for clubs to spend large sums of money to win the Copa Libertadores. In 1998 for example, [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]] spent $10 million to win the competition, and in 1998, [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]], managed by [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]], brought [[Júnior Baiano]] among other players, winning the [[1999 Copa Libertadores]]. The tournament is highly regarded among its participants. In 2010, players from [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] stated that they would rather play in the Copa Libertadores final than appear in a friendly against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], then reigning world champions,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/seleccion-mexicana/noticias/2010/08/05/espana-viene-con-18-campeones-del-mundo |title=España viene con 18 Campeones del Mundo |trans_title=Spain arrives with 18 world champions |language=Spanish |publisher=Medio Tiempo |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 }}</ref> and dispute their own national league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/mexico/noticias/2010/08/05/para-luis-michel-la-prioridad-es-la-copa-libertadores |title=Para Luis Michel la prioridad es la Copa Libertadores |trans_title=For Luis Michel the priority is the Copa Libertadores |language=Spanish |publisher=Medio Tiempo |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |first=Juan |last=Téllez }}</ref> Similarly, after their triumph in the [[2010 Copa do Brasil]], several Santos players made it known that they wished to stay at the club and participate in the [[2011 Copa Libertadores]], despite having multimillion-dollar contracts lined up for them at clubs participating in the [[UEFA Champions League]], such as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] of England and [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] of France.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/internacional/noticias/2010/08/05/quiero-quedarme-en-santos-robinho |title=Quiero quedarme en Santos: Robinho |trans_title=Robinho: I want to stay en Santos |language=Spanish |publisher=Medio Tiempo |date=August 5, 2010 |accessdate=August 5, 2010 }}</ref>

==='La Copa se mira y no se toca'===
Since its inception in 1960, the Copa Libertadores had predominantly been won by clubs from nations with an Atlantic coast: Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. [[Olimpia Asunción|Olimpia]] of Paraguay became the first team outside of those nations to win the Copa Libertadores when they triumphed in 1979.

The first club from a country with a Pacific coast to reach a final was [[Universitario de Deportes|Universitario]] of [[Lima]], [[Peru]], who lost in 1972 against [[Independiente de Avellaneda|Independiente]] of Argentina.<ref name="Independiente" /> The following year, Independiente defeated [[Colo-Colo]] of [[Chile]], another Pacific team, creating the myth that the trophy would never go to the west, giving birth to the saying, "La Copa se mira y no se toca" ({{lang-es|link=no|The Cup is seen but not touched}}).<ref name="Independiente" /> [[Unión Española]] became the third Pacific team to reach the final in 1975, although they also lost to Independiente.<ref name="Independiente" /> [[Atletico Nacional]] of [[Medellín]], Colombia, won the Copa Libertadores in 1989, becoming the first nation with a Pacific coastline to win the tournament,<ref name="1989AN" /> although Medellín is the capital of the [[Antioquia Department]], whose coastline is entirely on the Atlantic via the [[Caribbean Sea]].

Other clubs from nations with Pacific coastlines to have won the competition are [[Colo-Colo]] of [[Chile]] in 1991, [[Once Caldas]] of Colombia in 2004, and [[LDU Quito]] of Ecuador in 2008.

== Sponsorship ==
[[File:Bridgestone logo.svg|thumb|right|[[Bridgestone|Bridgestone Corporation]] is the primary sponsor of the Copa Libertadores.]]
Like the [[FIFA World Cup]], nowadays the Copa Libertadores is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations. However, unlike the World Cup, the competition has a single, main sponsor for naming rights; it is currently primarily sponsored by [[Bridgestone|Bridgestone Corporation]]. This sponsorship deal for naming rights is for a period of 5 years and began with the 2012 edition.<ref name="Santander">{{cite web |url=http://fe1.conmebol.com//copasantanderlibertadores/Libertadores-con-nuevo-patrocinador-20121203-0001.html |title=Libertadores, con nuevo patrocinador |trans_title=Libertadores, with a new sponsor|publisher=''[[Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol]]'' |date=December 3, 2012 |accessdate=December 3, 2012 |language=Spanish}}</ref> Thus, the competition is known officially as the '"Copa Bridgestone Libertadores'".

The first major sponsor was [[Toyota|Toyota Motor Corporation]], who signed a 10-year contract with CONMEBOL in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|author=Malcolm Flynn |url=http://www.themotorreport.com.au/54659/toyota-77-years-200-million-vehicles |title=Toyota Announces Its 200 Millionth Vehicle After 77 Years of Production &#124; Reviews &#124; Prices &#124; Australian specifications |publisher=Themotorreport.com.au |date=July 25, 2012 |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> The second major sponsor was [[Santander Group|Banco Santander]], who signed a 5-year contract with CONMEBOL in 2008.

Many secondary sponsors have invested in the tournament as well. [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] supplies the official match ball, as they do for all other CONMEBOL competitions.<ref name="Official ball" /> [[Konami]]'s [[Pro Evolution Soccer (series)|Pro Evolution Soccer]] is also a secondary sponsor as the official Copa Libertadores video game.<ref name="Konami">{{cite web |url=http://winningelevenblog.com/blog/the-coup-that-is-the-libertadores/#more-3615 |title=NewsThe Coup that is the Libertadores |publisher=WENB |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://forums.electronicarts.co.uk/fifa-10-feedback-suggestions/1038476-konami-acquires-rights-copa-libertadores.html |title=Konami Acquires Rights to Copa Libertadores |publisher=[[Konami]] |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}</ref> This was the [[Pro Evolution Soccer 2011|first video game]] to feature the competition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diehardgamefan.com/2010/04/08/konami-picks-up-copa-libertadores-for-pro-evolution-soccer-11/ |title=Konami Picks up Copa Libertadores for Pro Evolution Soccer '11 |publisher=Diehard Gamefan |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=May 18, 2010}}</ref> Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising, even if such sponsors conflict with those of the Copa Libertadores.<ref name="Reglamento" />

The ball, approved by FIFA and weighing approximately 422 g, has a spherical shape that allows the ball to fly faster, farther, and more accurately.<ref name="Official ball" /> According to Nike, the ball's [[geometric]] precision distributes pressure evenly across panels and around the ball. The compressed [[polyethylene]] layer stores energy from impact and releases it at launch, and the 6-wing carbon-latex air chamber improves acceleration.<ref name="Official ball" />

Another feature of the ball is its rubber layer; it was designed to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup.<ref name="Official ball" /> Its support material of cross-linked [[nitrogen]]-expanded [[foam]] improves its retention and durability of its shape.<ref name="Official ball" /> [[Polyester]] support fabric enhances structure and stability. The [[asymmetrical]] high-[[contrast (vision)|contrast]] [[graphic]] around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.<ref name="Official ball" />
