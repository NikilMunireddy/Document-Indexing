[[African-American history]] starts in the 16th century, with peoples from West Africa forcibly taken as [[Slavery|slaves]] to Spanish America, and in the 17th century with West African slaves taken to English [[Colony|colonies]] in North America.

===Slavery era===
{{Main|Slavery in the United States|Atlantic slave trade}}
The first African slaves arrived via [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] to the [[San Miguel de Gualdape]] colony (most likely located in the [[Winyah Bay]] area of present-day [[South Carolina]]), founded by Spanish explorer [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]] in 1526.<ref name=wright>{{cite journal | last1 = Robert Wright | first1 = Richard | authorlink = Richard Robert Wright | year = 1941 | title = Negro Companions of the Spanish Explorers | url = | journal = Phylon | volume = 2 | issue = 4 }}</ref>

The ill-fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership, during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local [[Native American]]s. De Ayllón and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned. The settlers and the slaves who had not escaped returned to [[Haiti]], whence they had come.<ref name=wright/>

The first recorded Africans in [[British North America]] (including most of the future United States) were "20 and odd negroes" who came to [[Jamestown, Virginia]] via [[Old Point Comfort|Cape Comfort]] in August 1619 as [[indentured servant]]s. As English settlers died from harsh conditions, more and more Africans were brought to work as laborers.

Typically, young men or women would sign a [[Indenture|contract of indenture]] in exchange for transportation to the New World. The landowner received 50 acres of land from the state ([[headright]]s) for each servant purchased (around £6 per person, equivalent to 9 months income in the 17th century) from a ship's captain.

An indentured servant (who could be white or black) would work for several years (usually four to seven) without wages. The status of indentured servants in early Virginia and Maryland was similar to slavery. Servants could be bought, sold, or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away. Unlike slaves, they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out, their children did not inherit their status, and on their release from contract they received "a year's provision of corn, double apparel, tools necessary", and a small cash payment called "freedom dues".<ref>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Hashaw|title=The First Black Americans|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm|publisher=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|date=January 21, 2007|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref>

By the 1640s and 1650s, several African families owned farms around Jamestown and some became wealthy by colonial standards and purchased indentured servants of their own. In 1640, the Virginia General Court recorded the earliest documentation of lifetime slavery when they sentenced [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], a Negro, to lifetime servitude under his master Hugh Gwyn for running away.<ref>{{Cite book|title=White Over Black: American attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550–1812|first=Winthrop|last=Jordan|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1968|url=http://www.amazon.com/White-Over-Black-Attitudes-1550-1812/dp/0807871419}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=In the Matter of Color: Race and the American Legal Process: The Colonial Period|first=A.

The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century. The [[Dutch West India Company]] introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into [[New Amsterdam]] (present-day New York City). All the colony's slaves, however, were freed upon its surrender to the British.<ref name="branchandroot">{{Citation|last=Hodges|first=Russel Graham|title=Root and Branch: African Americans in New York and East Jersey, 1613–1863|place=Chapel Hill, North Carolina |publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=1999|edition=|url=|id=|isbn=|quote=}}</ref>

[[Massachusetts]] was the first British colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641. In 1662 Virginia passed a law that children of enslaved women (who were of African descent and thus foreigners) took the status of the mother, rather than that of the father, as under English common law. This principle was called ''[[partus sequitur ventrum]]''.<ref name="Banks">[http://digitalcommons.law.umaryland.edu/fac_pubs/52/ Taunya Lovell Banks, "Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit – Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia"], 41 ''Akron Law Review'' 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed Apr 21, 2009</ref><ref>PBS.

By an act of 1699, the colony ordered all free blacks deported, virtually defining as slaves all persons of African descent who remained in the colony.<ref name="Wood">[https://books.google.com/books?id=BEd85InqqAIC&pg=PA48 William J.

The earliest African-American congregations and churches were organized before 1800 in both northern and southern cities following the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]]. By 1775, Africans made up 20% of the population in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], which made them the second largest ethnic group after the English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dalhousielodge.org/Thesis/scotstonc.htm|title=Scots to Colonial North Carolina Before 1775|publisher=Dalhousielodge.org|date=|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref>

During the 1770s, Africans, both enslaved and free, helped rebellious English colonists secure American Independence by defeating the British in the [[American Revolution]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/DIASPORA/REV.HTM|title=African Americans in the American Revolution|publisher=Wsu.edu:8080|date=June 6, 1999|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref> Africans and Englishmen fought side by side and were fully integrated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africanamericans.com/MilitaryTimeline.htm|title=AfricanAmericans.com|publisher=AfricanAmericans.com|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref>

Blacks played a role in both sides in the American Revolution. Activists in the Patriot cause included [[James Armistead]],  [[Prince Whipple]] and [[Oliver Cromwell (American soldier)|Oliver Cromwell]].<ref>Benjamin Quarles, ''The Negro in the American revolution'' (1961).</ref>

The question of slavery, although nowhere mentioned explicitly in the [[U.S. Constitution]], was one of the most difficult for the framers to deal with, resulting in the [[3/5 compromise]]. Slavery, which by then meant almost exclusively African Americans, was the most important political issue in the [[antebellum United States]], leading to one crisis after another. Among these were the [[Missouri Compromise]], the [[Compromise of 1850]], the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], and the [[Dred Scott decision]].

By 1860, there were 3.5 to 4.4 million enslaved African Americans in the United States due to the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and another 488,000–500,000 African Americans lived free across the country.<ref name="Nair2011">{{cite book|author=P Sukumar Nair|title=Human Rights In A Changing World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ah6r7ZuM15AC&pg=PA111|date=1 January 2011|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7835-901-4|page=111}}</ref><ref name="GomezPremdas">{{cite book|author1=Edmund Terence Gomez|author2=Ralph Premdas|title=Affirmative Action, Ethnicity and Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XU_XDHfO3jsC&pg=PA48|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-64506-5|page=48}}</ref>

The slaves not only constituted a large investment (slaves were valuable), they produced America's most valuable product and export: [[King Cotton|cotton]]. They not only helped build the [[U.S. Capitol]], they built the [[White House]] and other [[District of Columbia]] buildings. ([[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] was a slave trading center.<ref>"Ending slavery in the District of Columbia", http://emancipation.dc.gov/page/ending-slavery-district-columbia, consulted June 20, 2015.</ref>) Similar building projects existed in slaveholding states.

In 1863, during the [[American Civil War]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. The proclamation declared that all slaves in Confederate-held  territory were free.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Emancipation Proclamation|work=Featured Documents|publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]]|accessdate=June 7, 2007|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607051115/http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/emancipation_proclamation/|archivedate=June 7, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> Advancing Union troops enforced the proclamation with Texas being the last state to be emancipated, in 1865.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm|title=History of Juneteenth|publisher=Juneteenth.com|year=2005|accessdate=June 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527081441/http://www.juneteenth.com/history.htm|archivedate=May 27, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Slavery in Union-held Confederate territory continued, at least on paper, until the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] in 1865.

===Reconstruction and Jim Crow===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era of the United States|Jim Crow laws}}
[[File:Jesse Owens3.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jesse Owens]] shook racial stereotypes both with Nazis and
segregationists in the USA at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.]]
African Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves, as well as schools and community/civic associations, to have space away from white control or oversight. While the post-war Reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans, that period ended in 1876. By the late 1890s, Southern states enacted Jim Crow laws to enforce [[racial segregation]] and [[disfranchisement after the American Civil War|disenfranchisement]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Creating Jim Crow: In-Depth Essay|last=Davis|first=Ronald L.F., PhD|work=The History of Jim Crow|publisher=[[New York Life Insurance Company]]|accessdate=June 7, 2007|url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070601223741/http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm|archivedate=June 1, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> Most African Americans obeyed the Jim Crow laws, in order to avoid [[ethnic violence|racially motivated violence]]. To maintain self-esteem and dignity, African Americans such as [[Anthony Overton]] and [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] continued to build their own [[Historically black colleges and universities|schools]], [[Black church|churches]], banks, social clubs, and other businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/surviving.htm|title=Surviving Jim Crow|last=Davis|first=Ronald, PhD|work=The History of Jim Crow|publisher=[[New York Life Insurance Company]]}}</ref>

In the last decade of the 19th century, racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} These discriminatory acts included [[racial segregation]]—upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] in 1896<ref>''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' {{Ussc|163|537|1896}}</ref>—which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government, voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities.

===Great Migration and Civil Rights Movement===

The Civil Rights Movement from 1954 to 1968 was directed at abolishing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against African Americans, particularly in the Southern United States. The [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].
[[File:March on washington Aug 28 1963.jpg|thumb|[[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], August 28, 1963, shows civil rights leaders and union leaders.]]

Johnson put his support behind passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and [[Trade union|labor unions]], and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections. By 1966, the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement, which lasted from 1966 to 1975, expanded upon the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from white authority.<ref name="abbeville">{{cite web|url=http://www.abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp|title=The March On Washington, 1963|accessdate=October 22, 2007|publisher=Abbeville Press|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012121716/http://abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp|archivedate=October 12, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

During the postwar period, many African Americans continued to be economically disadvantaged relative to other Americans. Average black income stood at 54 percent of that of white workers in 1947, and 55 percent in 1962. In 1959, median family income for whites was $5,600, compared with $2,900 for nonwhite families. In 1965, 43 percent of all black families fell into the poverty bracket, earning under $3,000 a year. The Sixties saw improvements in the social and economic conditions of many black Americans.<ref name="ReferenceA">The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe</ref>

From 1965 to 1969, black family income rose from 54 to 60 percent of white family income. In 1968, 23 percent of black families earned under $3,000 a year, compared with 41 percent in 1960. In 1965, 19 percent of black Americans had incomes equal to the national median, a proportion that rose to 27 percent by 1967. In 1960, the median level of education for blacks had been 10.8 years, and by the late Sixties the figure rose to 12.2 years, half a year behind the median for whites.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Post-Civil Rights era===
{{Main|Post–Civil Rights era in African-American history}}

Politically and economically, African Americans have made substantial strides during the post-civil rights era. In 1989, [[Douglas Wilder]] became the first African American elected governor in U.S. history. [[Clarence Thomas]] became the second African-American Supreme Court Justice. In 1992 [[Carol Moseley-Braun]] of [[Illinois]] became the first African-American woman elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. There were 8,936 black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001 there were 484 black mayors.<ref>{{citation|last=Jordan|first=John H.|title=Black Americans 17th Century to 21st Century: Black Struggles and Successes|publisher=[[Trafford Publishing]]|page=586|year=2013}}</ref>

In 1790, when the first [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] was taken, Africans (including slaves and free people) numbered about 760,000—about 19.3% of the population. In 1860, at the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the African-American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country. The vast majority were slaves, with only 488,000 counted as "[[Freedman|freemen]]". By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million.

In 1910, about 90% of African Americans lived in the South. Large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions, and to escape [[Jim Crow laws]] and racial violence. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as it was called, spanned the 1890s to the 1970s. From 1916 through the 1960s, more than 6 million [[black people]] moved north. But in the 1970s and 1980s, [[New Great Migration|that trend reversed]], with more African Americans moving south to the [[Sun Belt]] than leaving it.

The following table of the African-American population in the United States over time shows that the African-American population, as a percentage of the total population, declined until 1930 and has been rising since then.

By 1990, the African-American population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the U.S. population, roughly the same proportion as in 1900.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/aap/timelin2.html|title=Time Line of African American History, 1881–1900|publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov|date=|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref>

At the time of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]], 54.8% of African Americans lived in the [[Southern United States|South]]. In that year, 17.6% of African Americans lived in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and 18.7% in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], while only 8.9% lived in the [[Western United States|western]] states. The west does have a sizable black population in certain areas, however. California, the nation's most populous state, has the fifth largest African-American population, only behind New York, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin]],<ref name="tthqvu"/> many of whom may be of [[Afro-Brazilian|Brazilian]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], [[Dominican American|Dominican]], [[Afro-Cuban|Cuban]], [[Haitian Americans|Haitian]], or other [[Afro-Latin American|Latin American]] descent.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 US Census]], nearly 3% of people who self-identified as black had recent ancestors who immigrated from another country. Self-reported [[West Indian American|non-Hispanic black immigrants from the Caribbean]], mostly from Jamaica and Haiti, represented 0.9% of the US population, at 2.6 million.<ref name="factfinder2.census.gov">[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&prodType=table "Total Ancestry Reported"], American FactFinder.</ref> Self-reported black immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also represented 0.9%, at about 2.8 million.<ref name="factfinder2.census.gov"/> Additionally, self-identified [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|Black Hispanics]] represented 0.4% of the United States population, at about 1.2 million people, largely found within the Puerto Rican and Dominican communities.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-04.pdf "The Hispanic Population: 2010"], 2010 Census Briefs.

Of the 12.6% of United States residents who identified as black, around 10.3% were "native black American" or ethnic African Americans, who are direct descendants of West/Central Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves. These individuals make up well over 80% of all blacks in the country.

[[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] has the second largest black population, with almost 1.6 million African Americans in its metropolitan area, representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan population.

After 100 years of African-Americans leaving the south in large numbers seeking better opportunities in the west and north ([[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]), there is now a reverse trend.  A growing percentage of African-Americans from the west and north are migrating to the southern region of the U.S. for economic and cultural reasons.  New York City, Chicago, and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] have the highest decline in African Americans, while Atlanta, [[Dallas,Texas|Dallas]], and [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] have the highest increase respectively.<ref>Greg Toppo and Paul Overberg, [http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/02/02/census-great-migration-reversal/21818127/ "After nearly 100 years, Great Migration begins reversal"], ''USA Today'', 2014.</ref>

Among cities of 100,000 or more, [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] had the highest percentage of black residents of any U.S. city in 2010, with 82%.

As late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. By 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans.<ref>Public Information Office, [[U.S. Census Bureau]].

US Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans aged 25 to 29 had completed a high-school education, less than whites or Asians, but more than Hispanics. On many college entrance, standardized tests and grades, African Americans have historically lagged behind whites, but some studies suggest that the [[Achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap]] has been closing. Many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as [[affirmative action]], desegregation, and multiculturalism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.closingtheachievementgap.org/cs/ctag/print/htdocs/home.htm|title=California|publisher=Closing the Achievement Gap|date=January 22, 2008|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref>

==Business==
African Americans have a long and diverse history of [[African-American Businesses|business ownership]]. Although the first [[African-American Businesses|African-American business]] is unknown, slaves captured from West Africa are believed to have established commercial enterprises as peddlers and skilled craftspeople as far back as the 17th century. Around 1900, Booker T. Washington became the most famous proponent of African American businesses. His critic and rival W.E.B. DuBois also commended business as a vehicle for African American advancement.<ref>Juliet E.K. Walker, The History of Black Business in America: Capitalism, Race, Entrepreneurship (New York: Macmillan Library Reference, 1998)</ref>

==Language==
{{Main|African American Vernacular English}}
[[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) is a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] ([[dialect]], [[ethnolect]], and [[sociolect]]) of [[American English]], commonly spoken by urban [[working class|working-class]] and largely [[wiktionary:bidialectal|bi-dialectal]] [[middle class|middle-class]] African Americans.<ref>{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Walter|chapter=African American Vernacular English: phonology|editor-last=Kortmann|editor-first=Bernd|work=A Handbook of Varieties of English|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2004|volume=2|page=383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dptsvykgk3IC|title=A Handbook of Varieties of English: CD-ROM|isbn=9783110175325}}</ref> Non-linguists sometimes call it ''[[Ebonics (word)|Ebonics]]'' (a term that also has other meanings and connotations).

African American Vernacular English evolved during the antebellum period through interaction between speakers of 16th and 17th century English of Great Britain and Ireland and various West African languages. As a result, the variety shares parts of its [[grammar]] and [[phonology]] with the [[Southern American English]] dialect. Where African American Vernacular English differs from Standard American English (SAE) is in certain pronunciation characteristics, tense usage and grammatical structures that were derived from West African languages, particularly those belonging to the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] family.<ref name="Aave">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=0387717986|page=405|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=PaO3jsaGkeYC|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>

Virtually all habitual speakers of African American Vernacular English can understand and communicate in Standard American English. As with all linguistic forms, AAVE's usage is influenced by various factors, including geographical, educational and socioeconomic background, as well as formality of setting.<ref name="Aave"/> Additionally, there are many literary uses of this variety of English, particularly in [[African-American literature]].

Some of the new words used by the people include "fleek" which means on point and "throwing shade" which means offending someone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://atlantablackstar.com/2015/01/29/10-slang-phrases-used-by-black-twitter-that-have-been-culturally-appropriated-by-the-mainstream/2/ |title=10 Slang Phrases used by Black Twitter |last=Gordon |first=Taylor |date=January 29, 2015 |website=atlantablackstar.|access-date=May 1, 2016}}</ref>

==Genetics==

===Y-DNA===
According to a [[Y chromosome|Y-DNA]] study by Sims et al. (2007), the majority (~60%) of African Americans belong to various subclades of the [[Haplogroup E-V38|E3a]] (E1b1a) paternal haplogroup. This is the most common genetic paternal lineage found today among West/Central African males, and is also a signature of the historical [[Bantu migration]]s. The next most frequent Y-DNA haplogroup observed among African Americans is the [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]] clade, which around 15% of African Americans carry. This lineage is most common today among Northwestern European males. The remaining African Americans mainly belong to the paternal [[Haplogroup I-M170|haplogroup I]] (~7%), which is also frequent in Northwestern Europe.<ref name="Sims2007">{{cite journal|author1=Lynn M. Sims |author2=Dennis Garvey |author3=Jack Ballantyne |title=Sub-populations within the major European and African derived haplogroups R1b3 and E3a are differentiated by previously phylogenetically undefined Y-SNPs|journal=Human Mutation|date=January 2007|volume=28|issue=1|page=97|doi=10.1002/humu.9469|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.9469/pdf|accessdate=3 November 2014|pmid=17154278}}</ref>

===mtDNA===
According to an [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] study by Salas et al. (2005), the maternal lineages of African Americans are most similar to haplogroups that are today especially common in West Africa (>55%), followed closely by West-Central Africa and Southwestern Africa (<41%). The characteristic West African haplogroups [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1b]], [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2b,c,d]], and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3b,d]] and West-Central African haplogroups [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1c]] and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3e]] in particular occur at high frequencies among African Americans. As with the paternal DNA of African Americans, contributions from other parts of the continent to their maternal gene pool are insignificant.<ref name="Salas2005">{{cite journal|author1=Antonio Salas |author2=Ángel Carracedo |author3=Martin Richards |author4=Vincent Macaulay |title=Charting the Ancestry of African Americans|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=October 2005|volume=77|issue=4|pages=676–680|doi=10.1086/491675|pmc=1275617|pmid=16175514}}</ref>

===Genome-wide studies===
According to a genome-wide study by Bryc et al. (2009), the overall ancestry of African Americans was formed through historic admixture between West/Central Africans (more frequently females) and Europeans (more frequently males). Consequently, the 365 African Americans in their sample have a genome-wide average of 78.1% West African ancestry and 18.5% European ancestry, with large variation among individuals (ranging from 99% to 1% West African ancestry). The West African ancestral component in African Americans is most similar to that in present-day speakers from the non-[[Bantu languages|Bantu]] branches of the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] (Niger-Kordofanian) family.<ref name="Bryc2009">{{cite journal|last1=Katarzyna Bryc, Adam Auton, Matthew R.

Correspondingly, Montinaro et al. (2014) observed that around 50% of the overall ancestry of African Americans traces back to the Niger-Congo-speaking [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of southwestern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Benin]], reflecting the centrality of this West Africa region in the Atlantic Slave Trade. The next most frequent ancestral component found among African Americans was derived from [[Great Britain]], in keeping with historical records. It constitutes a little over 10% of their overall ancestry, and is most similar to the Northwest European ancestral component also carried by [[Barbadians]].<ref name="Montinaro2014">{{cite journal|author1=Francesco Montinaro |author2=George B.J.

(2009) found a similar proportion of Yoruba associated ancestry in their African-American samples, with a minority also drawn from [[Mandenka people|Mandenka]] and [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] populations.

Altogether, genetic studies suggest that African Americans are a multiracial people. According to DNA analysis led in 2006 by [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]] geneticist [[Mark D. Shriver]], around 58 percent of African Americans have at least 12.5% European ancestry (equivalent to one European great-grandparent and his/her forebears), 19.6 percent of African Americans have at least 25% European ancestry (equivalent to one European grandparent and his/her forebears), and 1 percent of African Americans have at least 50% European ancestry (equivalent to one European parent and his/her forebears).<ref>{{cite book|title=''In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past''|author=Gates, Henry Louis Jr |authorlink=Henry Louis Gates, Jr.|publisher=New York: Crown Publishing|date= 2009|pages=20–21.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Henry Louis Gates Jr.: Michelle's Great-Great-Great-Granddaddy—and Yours|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/118292|author=Henry Louis Gates Jr.|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}</ref> According to Shriver, around 5 percent of African Americans also have at least 12.5% Native American ancestry (equivalent to one Native American great-grandparent and his/her forebears).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Henry Louis Gates, Jr. Reader|author=Henry Louis Gates, Jr.|publisher=Basci Civitas Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=5 Things to Know About Blacks and Native Americans|url=http://www.ebony.com/life/5-things-to-know-about-blacks-and-native-americans-119#axzz3WyEqX3XZ|date=November 20, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2015}}</ref>

==Traditional names==
{{Main|African-American names}}
[[African-American names]] are part of the cultural traditions of African Americans. Prior to the 1950s and 1960s, most African-American names closely resembled those used within European American culture.<ref name="Norman">{{cite book|last1=Norman|first1=Teresa|title=The African-American Baby Name Book|date=1998|publisher=Berkley Books|isbn=0425159396|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=XPkLGtzsKv0C|accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref> Babies of that era were generally given a few common names, with children using [[nickname]]s to distinguish the various people with the same name. With the rise of 1960s [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] movement, there was a dramatic increase in names of various origins.<ref name="Moskowitz">{{cite news|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Baby Names Reveal More About Parents Than Ever Before|url=http://www.livescience.com/9027-baby-names-reveal-parents.html|newspaper=Live Science|date=November 30, 2010}}</ref>

By the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common among African Americans to invent new names for themselves, although many of these invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as La/Le, Da/De, Ra/Re and Ja/Je, and suffixes like -ique/iqua, -isha and -aun/-awn are common, as are inventive spellings for common names. The book ''Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool--The Very Last Word on First Names'' places the origins of "La" names in African-American culture in [[New Orleans]].<ref name="Rosenkrantz">{{cite book|last=Rosenkrantz|first=Linda|title=Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool--The Very Last Word on First Names|date=August 16, 2001|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=0312267576|url=http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Names-Now-Classic-Cool--The/dp/B0009X1MMS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1393738023&sr=8-1&keywords=Baby+Names+Now%3A+From+Classic+to+Cool--The+Very+Last+Word+on+First+Names|author2=Satran, Paula Redmond}}</ref>

Even with the rise of inventive names, it is still common for African Americans to use biblical, historical, or traditional European names. Daniel, Christopher, Michael, David, James, Joseph, and Matthew were thus among the most frequent names for African-American boys in 2013.<ref name="Norman"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Lack|first=Evonne|title=Popular African American Names|url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_popular-african-american-names_10329236.bc|accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref><ref name="Conley">{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Dalton|title=Raising E and Yo...|journal=Psychology Today|date=March 10, 2010|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201003/raising-e-and-yo}}</ref>

The name LaKeisha is typically considered American in origin, but has elements of it that were drawn from both French and West/Central African roots. Other names like LaTanisha, JaMarcus, DeAndre, and Shaniqua were created in the same way. Punctuation marks are seen more often within African-American names than other American names, such as the names Mo'nique and D'Andre.<ref name="Norman"/>

==Contemporary issues==
African Americans have improved their social and economic standing significantly since the Civil Rights Movement and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust, African -middle class across the United States. Unprecedented access to higher education and employment in addition to representation in the highest levels of American government has been gained by African Americans in the post-civil rights era.

One of the most serious and long standing issues within African-American communities is poverty. Poverty itself is a hardship as it is related to marital stress and dissolution, health problems, low educational attainment, deficits in psychological functioning, and crime.<ref name="CharacOfFam">{{cite web|url=http://ssw.unc.edu/RTI/presentation/PDFs/aa_families.pdf|title=Characteristics of African American Families|author=Oscar Barbarin|publisher=University of North Carolina|accessdate=September 23, 2006|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920225226/http://ssw.unc.edu/RTI/presentation/PDFs/aa_families.pdf|archivedate=September 20, 2006 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> In 2004, 24.7% of African-American families lived below the poverty level.<ref name="DeNavas-Walt"/> In 2007, the average African-American income was $33,916, compared with $54,920 for whites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omhrc.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&lvlID=51|title=OMHRC.gov|publisher=OMHRC.gov|date=October 21, 2009|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref>

Until the [[New Deal]], African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves; at the time, the Republicans and Democrats represented the [[sectionalism|sectional]] interests of the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]], respectively, rather than any specific ideology, and both [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]] were represented equally in both parties.

The African-American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] program provided economic relief to African Americans; Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies, regardless of region. The African-American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s. In 1960, nearly a third of African Americans voted for Republican [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Clifford Green|author2=Daniel J.

===Political legacy===
[[File:Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] remains the most prominent political leader in the American Civil Rights Movement and perhaps the most influential African-American political figure in general.]]

The gains made by African Americans in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and in the [[Black Power movement]] not only obtained certain rights for African Americans, but changed American society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways. Prior to the 1950s, Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination, or [[Jim Crow laws]]. They were often the victims of extreme cruelty and violence, sometimes resulting in deaths: by the post WWII era, African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long-standing inequality. In the words of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to "rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal ..."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm|title=Martin Luther King, Jr|accessdate=May 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613010952/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm|archivedate=June 13, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The Civil Rights Movement marked an enormous change in American social, political, economic and civic life. It brought with it [[boycott]]s, [[sit-in]]s, [[nonviolent]] demonstrations and marches, court battles, bombings and other violence; prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate; forged enduring civic, economic and religious alliances; and disrupted and realigned the nation's two major political parties.

Over time, it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another. The movement resulted in the removal of codified, ''de jure'' racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law, and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society, including the [[Free Speech Movement]], the [[Disability|disabled]], the [[Feminist movement|women's movement]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and [[migrant workers]].

==News media and coverage==
[[File:20061023-1 d-0330-1-545v.jpg|thumb|200px|BET founder [[Robert L. Johnson]] with former U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]]]
Some activists and academics contend that news media coverage of African-American news concerns or dilemmas is inadequate<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackandbrownnews.com|title=BBN|publisher=blackandbrownnews.com|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4608039|title=Examining the Future of Black News Media|date=April 20, 2005|publisher=NPR}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4608042|title=How Will African Americans Get the News?|date=April 20, 2005|publisher=NPR}}</ref> or the news media present distorted images of African Americans.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mikal Muharrar|title=Media Blackface|publisher=FAIR|date=September–October 1998|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1431}}</ref> To combat this, [[Robert L. Johnson]] founded [[Black Entertainment Television]], a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States. Most programming on the network consists of [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music videos and urban-oriented movies and series. The channel also shows syndicated television series, original programs, and some public affairs programs. On Sunday mornings, BET broadcasts a lineup of network-produced Christian programming; other, non-affiliated Christian programs are also shown during the early morning hours daily. BET is now a global network that reaches 90 million households in the United States, Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|title=BET Networks|publisher=Viacom|url=http://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/betnetworks/pages/default.aspx|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}</ref>

In addition to BET there is [[Centric]], which is a spin-off cable television channel of BET, created originally as ''BET on Jazz'' to showcase [[jazz]] music-related programming, especially that of black jazz musicians. Programming has been expanded to include a block of urban programs as well as some R&B, [[soul music|soul]], and [[world music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829101056/http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18|archivedate=29 August 2007|title=BET J}}</ref>

[[TV One (Radio One)|TV One]] is another African-American-oriented network and a direct competitor to BET, targeting African-American adults with a broad range of programming. The network airs original lifestyle and entertainment-oriented shows, movies, fashion and music programming, as well as classic series such as [[227 (TV series)|227]], [[Good Times]], [[Martin (TV series)|Martin]], [[Boston Public]] and [[Showtime at the Apollo|It's Showtime at the Apollo]].

==Culture in the United States==
{{Further|African-American culture}}
[[File:Soul Food at Powell's Place.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[soul food]] dinner consisting of [[fried chicken]] with [[macaroni and cheese]], [[collard greens]], breaded fried [[okra]] and [[cornbread]].]]
From their earliest presence in [[North America]], African Americans have contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, cuisine, clothing styles, music, language, and social and technological innovation to American culture. The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the United States, such as [[Sweet potato|yams]], [[peanut]]s, [[rice]], [[okra]], [[sorghum]], [[grits]], [[watermelon]], [[indigo dye]]s, and [[cotton]], can be traced to West African and African-American influences. Notable examples include [[George Washington Carver]], who created 300 products from peanuts, 118 products from sweet potatoes, and 75 products from pecans; and [[George Crum]], who invented the potato chip in 1853.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml|title=African-American Inventors|accessdate=May 30, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613230925/http://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml|archivedate=June 13, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> [[Soul food]] is a variety of cuisine popular among African Americans. It is closely related to the [[cuisine of the Southern United States]]. The descriptive terminology may have originated in the mid-1960s, when ''[[wikt:soul|soul]]'' was a common definer used to describe African-American culture (for example, [[soul music]]). African Americans were the first peoples in the United States to make fried chicken, along with [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrants to the South. Although the Scottish had been frying chicken before they emigrated, they lacked the spices and flavor that African Americans had used when preparing the meal. The Scottish American settlers therefore adopted the African-American method of seasoning chicken.<ref>{{cite book|title=Advances in Deep Fat Frying of Foods|author1=Servet Gulum Sumnu |author2=Serpil Sahin |pages=1–2}}</ref> However, fried chicken was generally a rare meal in the African-American community, and was usually reserved for special events or celebrations.<ref>{{cite book|title=World of a Slave: Encyclopedia of the Material Life of Slaves in the United States|author1=Martha B.

===Music===
[[File:Jazzing orchestra 1921.png|thumb|The King & Carter [[Jazz]]ing Orchestra photographed in Houston, Texas, January 1921]]
[[African-American music]] is one of the most pervasive African-American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[funk]], [[rock and roll]], [[soul music|soul]], [[blues]], and other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music, including [[blues]], [[doo-wop]], [[Barbershop music|barbershop]], [[ragtime]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]].

African-American-derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other [[popular music]] genre in the world, including [[Country music|country]] and [[techno]]. African-American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America, as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups, including Europeans; make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America; and have, historically, been more influential, interculturally, geographically, and economically, than other American vernacular traditions.<ref name="stewart">{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Earl L.|year=1998|title=African American Music: An Introduction|isbn=0-02-860294-3|page=3|publisher=Schirmer Books|location=New York}}</ref>

African Americans have also had an important role in American dance. [[Bill T. Jones]], a prominent modern choreographer and dancer, has included historical African-American themes in his work, particularly in the piece "Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land". Likewise, [[Alvin Ailey]]'s artistic work, including his "Revelations" based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the 1930s, has had a significant influence on modern dance. Another form of dance, [[Stepping (African-American)|Stepping]], is an African-American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities.<ref name="Anderson">{{Cite news|last=Harris|first=Samantha|title=Stepping into controversy: Some fraternity members fear film 'Stomp the Yard' portrays them as glamorized dance group, trivializes traditions|newspaper=[[The Anderson Independent-Mail]]|location=[[Anderson, South Carolina]]|date=January 25, 2007|url=http://www.independentmail.com/news/2007/jan/25/stepping-controversy-some-fraternity-members-fear-/|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Literature and academics===

Many African-American authors have written stories, poems, and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans. [[African-American literature]] is a major genre in American literature. Famous examples include [[Langston Hughes]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Ralph Ellison]], Nobel Prize winner [[Toni Morrison]], and [[Maya Angelou]].

African-American inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international [[innovation]]. [[Norbert Rillieux]] created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals.

==Terminology==
[[File:1911 Golden Potlatch - Afro-Americans.jpg|thumb|left|This parade float shows a use of the word "Afro-American" in 1911.]]
The term ''African American'' carries important political overtones. Earlier terms used to describe Americans of African ancestry referred more to skin color than to ancestry, and were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry; people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law. The terms (such as ''[[colored]]'', ''[[person of color]]'', or ''[[negro]]'') were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of [[white supremacy]] and [[oppression]].<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xoZ0POyF2YkC&pg=PA86|title=Out of the Mouths of Slaves: African American Language and Educational Malpractice|author=Baugh, John|page=86|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-70873-0|year=1999}}</ref> There developed among blacks in America a growing desire for a term of self-identification of their own choosing.

[[File:Michelle Obama official portrait crop.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Michelle Obama]] is the [[First Lady]] of the United States; she and her husband, President Barack Obama, are the first African Americans to hold these positions.]]

In the 1980s the term ''African American'' was advanced on the model of, for example, [[German-American]] or [[Irish-American]] to give descendants of American slaves and other American blacks who lived through the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery era]] a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and a cultural base.<ref name="books.google.com"/> The term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after [[Jesse Jackson]] publicly used the term in front of a national audience in 1988. Subsequently, major media outlets adopted its use.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for "African American" versus "Black",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American?|first=Frank|last=Newport|publisher=Gallup|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=September 26, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906124630/http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/Black-African-American.aspx|archivedate=September 6, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> although they have a slight preference for "Black" in personal settings and "African American" in more formal settings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Pepper|last2=Kemp|first2=Herb|title=What's Black About?

Many African Americans expressed a preference for the term, because it was formed in the same way as the terms for the many other ethnic groups currently living in the nation. Some argued further that, because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture, enslavement and systematic attempts to de-Africanize blacks in the United States under [[Slavery|chattel slavery]], most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific African nation; hence, the entire continent serves as a geographic marker.

The term embraces pan-Africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as [[Marcus Garvey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[George Padmore]]. The term ''Afro-Usonian'', and variations of such, are more rarely used.<ref>Timothy Brennan, ''Secular Devotion: Afro-Latin Music and Imperial Jazz'', 2008, p. 249.</ref><ref>[http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2010/12/what_call_americans "Yankees, gringos and USAnians"], ''[[The Economist]]'', December 9, 2010, retrieved March 26, 2014.</ref>

Historically, "race mixing" between [[Black (people)|black]] and [[White American|white]] people was taboo in the United States.

In her opinion, President [[Barack Obama]], who is the son of a Kenyan immigrant, although technically black, is not African-American.<ref name="colorblind-salon"/><ref name="colbertnation.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/81955/february-08-2007/debra-dickerson?videoId=81955|title=The Colbert Report|author=Debra Dickerson|date=February 8, 2007|publisher=colbertnation.com|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref> She makes the argument that grouping all people of African descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the American community of slave descendants, in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds. "Lumping us all together", Dickerson wrote, "erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress".<ref name="colorblind-salon"/>

Similar viewpoints have been expressed by [[Stanley Crouch]] in a ''[[New York Daily News]]'' piece, [[Charles Steele, Jr.]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2008/06/21/sclc_head_michelle_obama_treat.html|title=SCLC head: Michelle Obama treated more roughly than her husband, because of her slave heritage|work=[[Atlanta Journal Constitution]]|date=June 21, 2008|accessdate=April 20, 2012}}</ref> and African-American columnist [[David Ehrenstein]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]]'' who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were "[[Magic Negro]]s", a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white (as cultural protagonists/drivers) agenda.<ref name="Obama the 'Magic Negro'">{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,5335087.story?coll=la-opinion-center|work=The Los Angeles Times|title=Obama the 'Magic Negro'|date=March 19, 2007|first=David|last=Ehrenstein}}</ref> Ehrenstein went on to say "He's there to assuage white 'guilt' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history."<ref name="Obama the 'Magic Negro'"/>

She has also rejected an immigrant designation for African Americans and instead prefers the term "black" or "white" to denote the African and European U.S. founding populations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bbaaghs.org/news/?p=10|title=Book Excerpt: Condoleezza Rice: An American Life|author=[[Elisabeth Bumiller]]|date=December 22, 2007|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref>

===Terms no longer in common use===
Before the independence of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] until the abolition of slavery in 1865, an African-American slave was commonly known as a ''[[negro]]''. ''[[Free negro]]'' was the legal status in the territory of an African-American person who was not a slave.<ref>{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Edward Franklin|title=The Free Negro Family|year=1968|pages=1}}</ref> The term ''[[Colored]]'' later also began to be used until the second quarter of the 20th century, when it was considered outmoded and generally gave way again to the exclusive use of ''negro''. By the 1940s, the term was commonly capitalized (''Negro''); but by the mid-1960s, it was considered disparaging. By the end of the 20th century, ''negro'' had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a [[pejorative]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Tottie|first=Gunnel|title=An Introduction to American English|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WWDUtK-f1tQC&pg=PA200|year=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-19792-3|page=200}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Talmadge|author2=James Stewart|title=Introduction to African American Studies|url=https://books.google.com/?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&pg=PA3|year=2007|publisher=Black Classics Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=1-58073-039-6|page=3}}</ref> The term is rarely used by younger black people, but remained in use by many older African Americans who had grown up with the term, particularly in the southern U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/they-put-negro-on-there/38094/|title=They Put 'Negro' on There?|author=Chris Good|date=March 26, 2010|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}</ref> The term remains in use in some contexts, such as the [[United Negro College Fund]], an American philanthropic organization that funds scholarships for black students and general scholarship funds for 39 private historically black colleges and universities, as well as in [[Latin America]] where Spanish and Portuguese are spoken. Pronounced slightly differently, it is the word for the color ''black'', and is rarely perceived as a pejorative.

There are many other deliberately insulting terms. Many were in common use (e.g., ''[[nigger]]''), but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the 20th century. One exception is the use, among the black community, of the slur ''nigger'' rendered as ''[[nigga]]'', representing the pronunciation of the word in [[African American Vernacular English]]. This usage has been popularized by the [[rap]] and [[hip-hop]] music cultures and is used as part of an in-group lexicon and speech. It is not necessarily derogatory and, when used among black people, the word is often used to mean "[[homie]]" or "friend".

Acceptance of intra-group usage of the word ''nigga'' is still debated, although it has established a foothold among younger generations. The [[NAACP]] denounces the use of both ''nigga'' and ''nigger''. Mixed-race usage of ''nigga'' is still considered taboo, particularly if the speaker is white. However, trends indicate that usage of the term in intragroup settings is increasing even among white youth due to the popularity of rap and hip hop culture.<ref name=ENQ>Kevin Aldridge, Richelle Thompson and Earnest Winston, [http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2001/08/05/loc_1the_n-word.html "The evolving N-word"], ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'', August 5, 2001.</ref>
