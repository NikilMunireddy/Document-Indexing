Because of its location in [[South Jersey]], hugging the Atlantic Ocean between marshlands and islands, Atlantic City was viewed by developers as prime real estate and a potential [[resort town]]. In 1853, the first commercial hotel, the Belloe House, was built at the intersection of Massachusetts and Atlantic Avenues.<ref>[http://www.cityofatlanticcity.org/con_abo_history.asp History], City of Atlantic City.

:"After arriving in Atlantic City, a second train brought the visitors to the door of the resort's first public lodging, the United States Hotel. The hotel was owned by the railroad. It was a sprawling, four-story structure built to house 2,000 guests. It opened while it was still under construction, with only one wing standing, and even that wasn't completed. By year's end, when it was fully constructed, the United States Hotel was not only the first hotel in Atlantic City but also the largest in the nation. Its rooms totaled more than 600, and its grounds covered some 14 acres."

The first [[List of boardwalks in the United States|boardwalk]] was built in 1870 along a portion of the beach in an effort to help hotel owners keep sand out of their lobbies. Businesses were restricted and the boardwalk was removed each year at the end of the peak season.<ref>[http://www.atlanticcitynj.com/mediaonline/story_ideas_detail.aspx?NewsID=80 "Atlantic City Boardwalk: A Stroll On the Wooden Way is Steeped in History"], Atlantic City Convention & Visitors Authority. Accessed August 23, 2013.</ref> Because of its effectiveness and popularity, the boardwalk was expanded in length and width, and modified several times in subsequent years. The historic length of the boardwalk, before the destructive [[1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane]], was about {{convert|7|mi|km}} and it extended from Atlantic City to [[Longport, New Jersey|Longport]], through [[Ventnor City, New Jersey|Ventnor]] and [[Margate City, New Jersey|Margate]].<ref>Schwartz, David.

Accessed August 23, 2013.</ref>

The first road connecting the city to the mainland at [[Pleasantville, New Jersey|Pleasantville]] was completed in 1870 and charged a 30-cent toll. Albany Avenue was the first road to the mainland available without a toll.<ref>[http://www.cityofatlanticcity.org/about.aspx History], City of Atlantic City. Accessed June 19, 2013.</ref>

By 1878, because of the growing popularity of the city, one railroad line could no longer keep up with demand. Soon, the [[Philadelphia and Atlantic City Railway]] was also constructed to transport tourists to Atlantic City. At this point massive hotels like The United States and Surf House, as well as smaller rooming houses, had sprung up all over town. The United States Hotel took up a full city block between Atlantic, Pacific, Delaware, and Maryland Avenues. These hotels were not only impressive in size, but featured the most updated amenities, and were considered quite luxurious for their time.

===Boom period===
[[Image:Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel (demolished) Atlantic City, NJ.jpg|left|thumb|Blenheim part of the [[Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel]] from the beach]]
[[Image:Chalfonte hotel brochure013.JPG|220px|left|thumb|Haddon Hall Hotel depicted on a postcard]]
In the early part of the 20th century, Atlantic City went through a radical building boom. Many of the modest boarding houses that dotted the boardwalk were replaced with large hotels. Two of the city's most distinctive hotels were the [[Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel]] and the [[Traymore Hotel]].

In 1903, Josiah White III bought a parcel of land near Ohio Avenue and the boardwalk and built the [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne style]] Marlborough House. The hotel was a hit and, in 1905–06, he chose to expand the hotel and bought another parcel of land next door to his Marlborough House. In an effort to make his new hotel a source of conversation, White hired the architectural firm of Price and McLanahan. The firm made use of [[reinforced concrete]], a new building material invented by Jean-Louis Lambot in 1848 (Joseph Monier received the patent in 1867). The hotel's Spanish and Moorish themes, capped off with its signature dome and chimneys, represented a step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence. White named the new hotel the Blenheim and merged the two hotels into the Marlborough-Blenheim. [[Bally's Atlantic City]] was later constructed at this location.

[[File:Atlantic City Boardwalk crowd in front of Blenheim hotel 1911 re-retouched.jpg|thumb|Atlantic City Boardwalk crowd in front of Blenheim hotel, 1911 (retouched)]]
The Traymore Hotel was located at the corner of Illinois Avenue and the boardwalk. Begun in 1879 as a small boarding house, the hotel grew through a series of uncoordinated expansions. By 1914, the hotel's owner, Daniel White, taking a hint from the Marlborough-Blenheim, commissioned the firm of Price and McLanahan to build an even bigger hotel. Rising 16 stories, the tan brick and gold-capped hotel would become one of the city's best-known landmarks. The hotel made use of ocean-facing hotel rooms by jutting its wings farther from the main portion of the hotel along Pacific Avenue.

One by one, additional large hotels were constructed along the boardwalk, including the Brighton, Chelsea, Shelburne, Ambassador, Ritz Carlton, Mayflower, Madison House, and the Breakers. The Quaker-owned Chalfonte House, opened in 1868, and Haddon House, opened in 1869, flanked North Carolina Avenue at the beach end. Over the years, their original wood-frame structures would be enlarged, and even moved closer to the beach. The modern Chalfonte Hotel, eight stories tall, opened in 1904. The modern Haddon Hall was built in stages and was completed in 1929, at eleven stories. By this time, they were under the same ownership and merged into the [[Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel]], becoming the city's largest hotel with nearly 1,000 rooms. By 1930, the Claridge, the city's last large hotel before the casinos, opened its doors. The 400-room Claridge was built by a partnership that included renowned Philadelphia contractor [[John McShain]]. At 24 stories, it would become known as the "Skyscraper By The Sea." The city became known as the "The World's Playground.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/atlanticcityworl01nati/atlanticcityworl01nati_djvu.txt ''Atlantic City, the world's playground''], National City Advertising Company, 1922.

In 1883, [[salt water taffy]] was conceived in Atlantic City by David Bradley. The traditional story is that Bradley's shop was flooded after a major storm, soaking his taffy with salty [[Atlantic Ocean]] water. He sold some "salt water taffy" to a girl, who proudly walked down to the beach to show her friends. Bradley's mother was in the back of the store when the sale was made, and loved the name, and so [[salt water taffy]] was born.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Candy&fid=6706 |title=Salt water taffy history |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524081109/http://www.hungrymonster.com/FoodFacts/Food_Facts.cfm?Phrase_vch=Candy&fid=6706 |archivedate=May 24, 2006 |accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>Donohue, Jeanne.

===Prohibition era===
The 1920s, with tourism at its peak, are considered by many historians as Atlantic City's golden age. During [[Prohibition]], which was enacted nationally in 1919 and lasted until 1933, much liquor was consumed and gambling regularly took place in the back rooms of nightclubs and restaurants. It was during Prohibition that [[racketeer]] and political boss [[Enoch L. Johnson|Enoch L. "Nucky" Johnson]] rose to power. Prohibition was largely unenforced in Atlantic City, and, because alcohol that had been smuggled into the city with the acquiescence of local officials could be readily obtained at restaurants and other establishments, the resort's popularity grew further.<ref>[http://atlanticcityexperience.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12&Itemid=4 "Nucky's Empire: The Prohibition Years – Prohibition in a Wide Open Town"], The Atlantic City Experience. Accessed December 19, 2011. "In Atlantic City, Prohibition was essentially unenforced by the local authorities. Atlantic City was a well-known haven for those seeking alcohol. The tourist-based economy of the resort encouraged business owners to provide whatever was needed to make the visitors happy."</ref> The city then dubbed itself as "The World's Playground". Nucky Johnson's income, which reached as much as $500,000 annually, came from the [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] he took on illegal liquor, gambling and prostitution operating in the city, as well as from kickbacks on construction projects.<ref>Staff.

"Most of Johnson's income in his heyday came from the percentage he took on each gallon of illegal liquor...

===Decline and resurgence===
[[Image:The Tropicana.JPG|thumb|[[Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City|The Tropicana]] from the boardwalk]]
Like many older east coast cities after World War II, Atlantic City became plagued with poverty, crime, corruption, and general economic decline in the mid-to-late 20th century. The neighborhood known as the "Inlet" became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's decline were multi-layered. First, the automobile became more readily available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks. The advent of suburbia also played a huge role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer. But perhaps the biggest factor in the decline in Atlantic City's popularity came from cheap, fast jet service to other premier resorts, such as [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] and the [[Bahamas]].<ref>Ryan, Robert.

The city hosted the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] which nominated [[Lyndon Johnson]] for President and [[Hubert Humphrey]] as Vice President. The convention and the press coverage it generated, however, cast a harsh light on Atlantic City, which by then was in the midst of a long period of economic decline. Many felt that the friendship between Johnson and [[Governor of New Jersey]] [[Richard J. Hughes]] led Atlantic City to host the Democratic Convention.<ref>Waltzer, Jim.

By the late 1960s, many of the resort's once great hotels were suffering from embarrassing vacancy rates. Most of them were either shut down, converted to cheap apartments, or converted to nursing home facilities by the end of the decade. Prior to and during the advent of legalized [[gambling|gaming]], many of these hotels were demolished. The Breakers, the Chelsea, the Brighton, the Shelburne, the Mayflower, the [[Traymore Hotel|Traymore]], and the [[Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel|Marlborough-Blenheim]] were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s. Of the many pre-casino resorts that bordered the boardwalk, only the Claridge, the Dennis, the [[Ritz-Carlton Hotel (Atlantic City)|Ritz-Carlton]], and the Haddon Hall survive to this day as parts of [[Bally's Atlantic City]], a condo complex, and [[Resorts Atlantic City]]. The old Ambassador Hotel was purchased by Ramada in 1978 and was gutted to become the [[Tropicana Casino and Resort Atlantic City]], only reusing the steelwork of the original building.<ref>Hoffman, Lori.

===Legalized gambling===
{{Main|Gambling in New Jersey}}
In an effort at revitalizing the city, New Jersey voters in 1976 passed a referendum, approving [[casino]] gambling for Atlantic City; this came after a 1974 referendum on legalized gambling failed to pass. Immediately after the legislation passed, the owners of the [[Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel]] began converting it into the Resorts International. It was the first legal casino in the eastern United States when it opened on May 26, 1978.<ref>Clarity, James F.

The introduction of gambling did not, however, quickly eliminate many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City. Many people have suggested that it only served to exacerbate those problems, as attested to by the stark contrast between tourism intensive areas and the adjacent impoverished working-class neighborhoods.<ref>Bryant Simon, ''Boardwalk of Dreams: Atlantic City and the fate of urban America'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref> In addition, Atlantic City has been less popular than Las Vegas as a gambling city in the United States.<ref>Fabricant, Florence.

===Modern day challenges===
[[File:Atlantic City NJ night.jpg|thumb|left|Atlantic City at night]]
With the redevelopment of [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and the opening of two casinos in [[List of casinos in Connecticut|Connecticut]] in the early 1990s, along with newly built  casinos in the nearby [[List of casinos in Pennsylvania|Philadelphia metro area]] in the 2000s, Atlantic City's tourism began to decline due to its failure to diversify away from gaming. Determined to expand, in 1999 the Atlantic City Redevelopment Authority partnered with Las Vegas casino mogul [[Steve Wynn (entrepreneur)|Steve Wynn]] to develop a new roadway to a barren section of the city near the Marina. Nicknamed "The Tunnel Project", Steve Wynn planned the proposed 'Mirage Atlantic City' around the idea that he would connect the $330 million tunnel stretching {{convert|2.5|mi}} from the [[Atlantic City Expressway]] to his new resort. The roadway was later officially named the [[Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector]], and funnels incoming traffic off of the expressway into the city's marina district and [[Brigantine, New Jersey]].<ref>Kraft, Randy. [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/79645003.html?dids=79645003:79645003&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+02%2C+2001&author=RANDY+KRAFT+Of+The+Morning+Call&pub=Morning+Call&desc=Atlantic+City+is+gambling+on+a+brighter+future&pqatl=google "Atlantic City is gambling on a brighter future"], ''[[The Morning Call]]'', September 2, 2001{{accessdate|January 13, 2012}} "Another major improvement is the $330&nbsp;million Atlantic City- Brigantine connector project, locally known simply as the tunnel. The new 2.5-mile (4.2 km) long highway with a 2,200-foot (670 meter) tunnel opened on July 31. A toll free extension of the Atlantic City Expressway, which links Atlantic City and Philadelphia, it connects the south end of the expressway to casinos in Atlantic City's marina district as well as to neighboring Brigantine."</ref>

Although Wynn's plans for development in the city were scrapped in 2002, the tunnel opened in 2001. The new roadway prompted Boyd Gaming in partnership with MGM/Mirage to build Atlantic City's newest casino. [[The Borgata]] opened in July 2003, and its success brought an influx of developers to Atlantic City with plans for building grand Las Vegas style mega casinos to revitalize the aging city.<ref>via [[Associated Press]].

Accessed October 15, 2015.</ref>

Owing to economic conditions and the [[late 2000s recession]], many of the proposed mega casinos never went further than the initial planning stages. One of these developers was [[Pinnacle Entertainment]], who purchased the [[Sands Atlantic City]], only to close it permanently November 11, 2006. The following year, the resort was demolished in a dramatic, Las Vegas styled implosion, the first of its kind in Atlantic City. While Pinnacle Entertainment intended to replace it with a $1.5–2 billion casino resort, the company canceled its construction plans and plans to sell the land. The biggest disappointment was when [[MGM Resorts International]] announced that it would pull out of all development for Atlantic City, effectively ending their plans for the [[MGM Grand Atlantic City]].<ref>Rivlin, Gary.

===Climate===
Atlantic City has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with some maritime moderation, especially during the summer.

Summers are typically warm and humid with a July daily average of {{convert|75.6|°F|1}}. During this time, the city gets a sea breeze off the ocean that often makes daytime temperatures much cooler than inland areas, making Atlantic City a prime place for beating the summer heat from June through September. Average highs even just a few miles west of Atlantic City exceed {{convert|85|°F|0}} in July. Near the coast, temperatures reach or exceed {{convert|90|°F|0}} on an average of only 6.8 days a year, but this reaches 21 days at nearby Atlantic City International Airport.<ref name=NOAA>[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=phi NowData - NOAA Online Weather Data], [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].

Spring and autumn are erratic, although they are usually mild with low humidity. The average window for freezing temperatures is November 20 to March 25,<ref name = NOAA/> allowing a growing season of 239 days. Extreme temperatures range from {{convert|−9|°F|0}} on February 9, 1934 to {{convert|104|°F|0}} on August 7, 1918.{{efn|The corresponding range at Atlantic City Int'l is {{convert|−11|°F|0}} on February 12, 1979 to {{convert|106|°F|0}} on June 28, 1969.<ref name = NOAA/>}}

Annual precipitation is {{convert|40|in|sigfig=3}} which is fairly spread throughout the year. Owing to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and its location in South Jersey, Atlantic City receives less snow than a good portion of the rest of New Jersey. Even at the airport, where low temperatures are often much lower than along the coast, snow averages only {{convert|16.5|in|cm|1}} each winter. It is very common for rain to fall in Atlantic City while the northern and western parts of the state are receiving snow.

===Tourism district===
In July 2010, Governor [[Chris Christie]] announced that a state takeover of the city and local government "was imminent". Comparing regulations in Atlantic City to an "antique car", Atlantic City regulatory reform is a key piece of Governor Chris Christie's plan, unveiled on July 22, to reinvigorate an industry mired in a four-year slump in revenue and hammered by fresh competition from casinos in the surrounding states of [[Delaware]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Connecticut]], and more recently, [[Maryland]]. In January 2011, Chris Christie announced the creation of the Atlantic City Tourism District, a state-run district encompassing the boardwalk casinos, the marina casinos, the [[Atlantic City Outlets]], and [[Bader Field]].<ref>Wittkowski, Donald.

On April 29, 2011, the boundaries for the state-run tourism district were set. The district would include heavier police presence, as well as beautification and infrastructure improvements. The CRDA would oversee all functions of the district and make changes to attract new businesses and attractions. New construction will be ambitious and may resort to [[eminent domain]].<ref>Clark, Michael.

The tourism district would comprise several key areas in the city; the Marina District, [[Ducktown, Atlantic City|Ducktown]], Chelsea, South Inlet, [[Bader Field]], and Gardner's Basin. Also included are 10 roadways that lead into the district, including several in the city's northern end, or North Beach. Gardner's Basin, which is home to the Atlantic City Aquarium, was initially left out of the tourism district, while a residential neighborhood in the Chelsea section was removed from the final boundaries, owing to complaints from the city. Also, the inclusion of Bader Field in the district was controversial and received much scrutiny from mayor Lorenzo Langford, who cast the lone "no" vote on the creation of the district citing its inclusion.<ref>Staff.

[[File:A307, Boardwalk, Atlantic City, New Jersey, USA, 2012.JPG|thumb|left|Looking south from the [[Playground Pier]] overpass in December 2012]]
The Atlantic City Boardwalk was the first [[boardwalk]] in the United States, having opened on June 26, 1870.<ref name=June26-1870>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jun26.html|title=Today in History|publisher=|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}</ref>

The Boardwalk starts at Absecon Inlet in the north and runs along the beach south-west to the city limit {{convert|4|mi}} away then continues {{convert|1+1/2|mi}} into [[Ventnor City, New Jersey|Ventnor City]]. Casino/hotels front the boardwalk, as well as retail stores, restaurants, and amusements. Notable attractions include the [[Boardwalk Hall]], [[House of Blues]], and the [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] museum.

In October 2012, [[Hurricane Sandy]] destroyed the northern part of the boardwalk fronting Absecon Inlet, in the residential section called South Inlet. The oceanfront boardwalk in front of the Atlantic City casinos survived the storm undamaged.<ref>{{cite news|last=Brennan|first=John|title=Putting the Atlantic City Boardwalk myth to bed|url=http://blog.northjersey.com/meadowlandsmatters/3979/putting-the-atlantic-city-boardwalk-myth-to-bed/|accessdate=October 30, 2012|newspaper=[[The Record (Bergen County)]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Jaffe|first=Greg|title=Atlantic City takes stock of storm damage|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/atlantic-city-takes-stock-of-storm-damage/2012/10/30/b54e6eee-22d4-11e2-8448-81b1ce7d6978_story.html|accessdate=October 30, 2012 |newspaper=Washington Post|date=October 30, 2012}}</ref>

The Boardwalk has been home to several piers over the years.
* The first pier, Ocean Pier, was built in 1882.<ref>{{cite web |work=acmuseum.org |url=http://www.acmuseum.org/piers.html |title=Atlantic City Museum website |accessdate=November 25, 2006}}</ref> It eventually fell into disrepair and was demolished. Another famous pier built during that time was [[Steel Pier]], opened in 1898, which once billed itself as "The Showplace of the Nation". It now operates as an amusement pier across from the [[Trump Taj Mahal]]. Captain John Lake Young opened "Young's [[Million Dollar Pier]]" as an arcade hall in 1903, and on the seaward side "erected a marble mansion", fronted by a formal garden, with lighting and landscaping designed by Young's longtime friend [[Thomas Alva Edison]]. Young's Million Dollar Pier, Atlantic City's largest amusement pier during its time",<ref name="Johnson, Nelson 2010 30"/> was transformed into a shopping mall in the 1980s, known as "Shops on Ocean One".

===Monopoly===
Atlantic City (sometimes referred to as "Monopoly City"<ref>{{cite web|work=monopolycity.com|title=MonopolyCity.com|url=http://www.monopolycity.com|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>) has become well-known over the years for its portrayal in the U.S. version of the popular board game, ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', in which properties on the board are named after locations in and near Atlantic City. While the original incarnation of the game did not feature Atlantic City, it was in Indianapolis that Ruth Hoskins learned the game, and took it back to Atlantic City.<ref>{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Tim|title=The Playmakers: Amazing Origins of Timeless Toys|publisher=Keys Publishing|year=2004|isbn=0-9646973-4-3|page=48}}</ref> After she arrived, Hoskins made a new board with Atlantic City street names, and taught it to a group of local [[Quaker]]s.<ref>Orbanes, ''Monopoly Companion'' Second edition. Page 20.</ref>

Some of the actual locations that correspond to board elements have changed since the game's release. Illinois Avenue was [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King, Jr.|renamed Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd.]] in the 1980s. St. Charles Place no longer exists, as the [[Showboat Casino Hotel]] was developed where it once ran.<ref>Kennedy, Rod (2004) ''Monopoly: the story behind the world's best-selling game''; text by Jim Waltzer. Salt Lake City, Utah: Gibbs Smith; p. 35</ref>

Marvin Gardens, the leading yellow property on the board, is actually a misspelling of the original location name, "[[Marven Gardens]]". The misspelling was said to have been introduced by Charles Todd and passed on when his home-made ''Monopoly'' board was copied by Charles Darrow and thence Parker Brothers. It was not until 1995 that Parker Brothers acknowledged this mistake and formally apologized to the residents of Marven Gardens for the misspelling although the spelling error was not corrected.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/monopoly/index.html |title=Monopoly, Present at the Creation |publisher=NPR |accessdate=June 10, 2009}}</ref>

The "Short Line" is believed to refer to the [[Shore Fast Line]], a [[tram|streetcar line]] that served Atlantic City.<ref>Kennedy (2004); p. 23.</ref> The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&O Railroad]] did not serve Atlantic City. A booklet included with the reprinted 1935 edition states that the four railroads that served [[Atlantic City]] in the mid-1930s were the [[Central Railroad of New Jersey|Jersey Central]], the [[Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines|Seashore Lines]], the [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]], and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

The actual "Electric Company" and "Water Works" serving the city are respectively, [[Atlantic City Electric Company]] and the Atlantic City Municipal Utilities Authority.

Ever since Atlantic City's growth as a resort town, numerous attractions and [[tourist traps]] have originated in the city. A popular fixture in the early 20th century at the Steel Pier was [[horse diving]], which was introduced by [[William Frank Carver|William "Doc" Carver]].<ref name="Dedicated to The Diving Horses">[http://www.steel-pier.com/dedicated_to_the_diving_horses.htm Dedicated to The Diving Horses<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Steel Pier featured several other novelty attractions, including the Diving Bell, human high-divers, and a water circus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Futrell|first=Jim|title=Amusement Parks of New Jersey|year=2004|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=PA|isbn=0811729737|page=54}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Steel-Pier.com|url=http://www.steel-pier.com/}}</ref> Advertisements for the Steel Pier in its heyday featured plaster sculptures set upon wooden bases along roads leading up to Atlantic City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bassriverhistory.blogspot.com/2010/07/mysterious-artifact-revealed.html |title=The Mysterious Artifact Revealed |work=Bass River Township, N.J.

Rolling chairs, which were introduced in the 1800s, have been a boardwalk fixture to this day. While powered carts appeared in the 1960s, the original and most common were made of wicker.

While located two miles south of Atlantic City in [[Margate City, New Jersey|Margate City]], [[Lucy the Elephant]] has become almost an icon for the Atlantic City area. Lucy is a six-story [[elephant]]-shaped example of [[novelty architecture]], constructed of wood and tin sheeting in 1882 by [[James V. Lafferty]] in an effort to sell real estate and attract tourism. Over the years, Lucy had served as a restaurant, business office, cottage, and tavern (the last closed by [[Prohibition]]). Lucy had fallen into disrepair by the 1960s and was scheduled for demolition. The structure was moved and refurbished as a result of a "Save Lucy" campaign in 1970 and received designation as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1976, and is open as a museum.<ref>Hillinger, Charles.

===Miss America Pageant===
Atlantic City is the home of the [[Miss America]] competition, however it was  moved to Las Vegas for seven years before returning. The Miss America competition originated on September 7, 1921, as a two-day beauty contest, and it included state contestants as well as women from various cities around the country. The event that year was called the "Atlantic City Pageant," and the winner of the grand prize, Margaret Gorman, took home the 3-foot Golden Mermaid trophy. Gorman was not called "Miss America" until 1922, when she re-entered the pageant and lost to Mary Campbell.<ref>Osborne, A. S. (1995). Miss America, the dream lives on. Dallas, TX: Taylor Publishing.</ref> The pageant was initiated to extend the tourist season after the [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day weekend]].<ref name=Good2010/> The pageant has been nationally [[television|televised]] since 1954. It peaked in the early 1960s, when it was repeatedly the highest-rated program on American television. It was seen as a symbol of the United States, with Miss America often being referred to as the female equivalent of the [[President of the United States|President]]. The pageant's longtime [[Master of ceremonies|emcee]], [[Bert Parks]], hosted the event from 1955 to 1979. At the [[Atlantic City Convention Center]], there is an interactive statue of Parks holding a crown. When a visitor puts their head inside the crown, sensors activate a recorded playback of his ''"There She Is..."'' line through speakers hidden behind nearby bushes.<ref>[http://www.peoplevisionfx.com/projects.htm PeopleVision FX Selected Projects]. Accessed December 4, 2006.</ref>

After the departure of the Miss America pageant from the city, a [[LGBT]] event known as the "Miss'd America Pageant" is held annually at the Boardwalk Hall. Originally started as a fundraiser, the event features [[drag queens]] donning the runway in a similar manner to the Miss America pageant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atlanticcitynj.com/missd-america.aspx |title=Miss'd America Pageant |work=Atlanticcitynj.com |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref>

===''Boardwalk Empire''===
Since 2010, ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', an American television series from cable network [[HBO]] set in Atlantic City during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition era]], has cast a new light on the city. Starring [[Steve Buscemi]], the show was adapted from a chapter about historical criminal kingpin [[Enoch L. Johnson|Enoch "Nucky" Johnson]] (who is renamed "Enoch Thompson" in the show) in Nelson Johnson's book, ''Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City''.<ref name="kinon1">{{cite news|last=Kinon|first=Cristina|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/09/08/2010-09-08_hbos_boardwalk_empire_uses_new_york_as_a_standin_for_atlantic_city_chicago_and_l.html |title=HBO's 'Boardwalk Empire' uses New York as a stand-in for Atlantic City, Chicago and Los Angeles |work=New York Daily News |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=October 21, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100911090403/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2010/09/08/2010-09-08_hbos_boardwalk_empire_uses_new_york_as_a_standin_for_atlantic_city_chicago_and_l.html| archivedate= 11 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The series is filmed in [[Brooklyn, New York]] on a set built to resemble the Atlantic City boardwalk in the 1920s.

Around the same time of the September 2010 premiere of the show, the ''[[Press of Atlantic City]]'' created ''Boss of the Boardwalk'', a 45-minute documentary which premiered on August 21, 2010 on [[WMGM-TV|NBC TV-40]] and aired six additional times in the following weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/blogs/boardwalk_empire/article_0c27de52-ac77-11df-98c7-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Press documentary 'Boss of the Boardwalk' chronicles the life and times of Nucky Johnson |author=Scott Cronick |work=[[The Press of Atlantic City]] |date=August 20, 2010 |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref>

Since the premiere of ''Boardwalk Empire'', interest in [[Roaring Twenties]]-era Atlantic City has grown. In October 2010, a plan was revealed to renovate the ailing [[Resorts Casino Hotel]] into a Roaring Twenties theme. The re-branding was proposed by current owner Dennis Gomes, and was initiated in December 2010 when he took over the casino. The changes accentuate the resort's existing art deco design, as well as presenting new 20s-era uniforms for employees and music from the time period. The casino also introduced drinks and shows reminiscent of the period.<ref>[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/10/atlantic_city_hotel-casino_to.html Resorts Atlantic City to adopt 1920s theme in nod to 'Boardwalk Empire'] ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' | October 7, 2010</ref> The actual building where he lived, [[Ritz-Carlton Atlantic City|The Ritz-Carlton]], offer tours.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Ritz: Where Nucky Lay His Head|quote=Tours of Nucky Johnson's one-time home are now being offered as Boardwalk Empire mania continues to sweep the city. | newspaper = Atlantic City Weekly | date = November 10, 2010 | url = http://www.atlanticcityweekly.com/news-and-views/features/The-Ritz-Where-Nucky-Lay-His-Head-107047503.html |accessdate=June 26, 2011}}</ref>
