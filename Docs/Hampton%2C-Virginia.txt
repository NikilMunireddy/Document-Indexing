'''Hampton''' is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in [[Virginia]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 137,436.<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51650.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref>

As one of the seven major cities that compose the [[Hampton Roads]] metropolitan area, it is on the southeastern end of the [[Virginia Peninsula]].

Hampton traces its history to the city's [[Old Point Comfort]], the home of [[Fort Monroe]] for almost 400 years, which was named by the 1607 voyagers, led by Captain [[Christopher Newport]], who first established [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] as an [[Kingdom of England|English]] colonial settlement. Since consolidation in 1952, Hampton has included the former [[Elizabeth City County, Virginia|Elizabeth City County]] and the [[incorporated town]] of [[Phoebus, Virginia|Phoebus]], consolidating by mutual agreement.

After the end of the [[American Civil War]], historic [[Hampton University]] was established opposite from the town on the [[Hampton River]], providing an education for many newly-freed former slaves and for area Native Americans. In the 20th century, the area became the location of [[Langley Air Force Base]], [[NASA]] [[Langley Research Center]], and the [[Virginia Air and Space Center]]. Hampton features many miles of waterfront and beaches.

For residents and visitors alike, the city features a wide array of business and industrial enterprises, retail and residential areas, and historical sites. Most recently, the new [[Peninsula Town Center]] development opened in May 2010 on the site of the former Coliseum Mall. Located in the area adjacent to the [[Hampton Coliseum]] and the Convention Center, the [[new urbanism]]-type project features a wide mix of retail stores, housing and other attractions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peninsulatowncenter.com/|title=Peninsula Town Center|work=Peninsula Town Center|accessdate=5 December 2015}}</ref> Development of new residential development and additional public facilities (such as the new fishing pier recently opened) are underway at [[Buckroe Beach]], long a noted resort area.<ref>http://www.hampton.gov/ed/plans/buckroe.html</ref>

Located on the [[Hampton Roads Beltway]], it hosts the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] (HRBT) on [[Interstate 64 in Virginia|Interstate 64]]. First opened in 1957, it was the world's first [[bridge-tunnel]], crossing the mouth of the Hampton Roads harbor, which serves as the gateway to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] from the eastern United States' largest ice-free harbor and its tributary rivers. Expanded in the 1970s, the HRBT remains Virginia's busiest and deepest such facility.

==History==
In December 1606, three ships carrying men and boys left England on a mission sponsored by a proprietary company. Headed by Captain [[Christopher Newport]], they sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to North America. After a long voyage, they first landed at the entrance to the [[Chesapeake Bay]] on the south shore at a place they named [[Cape Henry]] (for [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the elder son of their king).

During the first few days of exploration, they identified the site of [[Old Point Comfort]] (which they originally named "Point Comfort") as a strategic defensive location at the entrance to the body of water that became known as [[Hampton Roads]].  This is formed by the [[confluence]] of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth]], [[Nansemond River|Nansemond]], and [[James River (Virginia)|James]] rivers.  The latter is the longest river in Virginia.

Weeks later, on May 14, 1607, they established the first permanent English settlement in the present-day United States about {{convert|25|mi|km}} further inland from the Bay which became the site of fortifications during the following 200 years.

Slightly south, near the entrance to [[Hampton River]], the colonists seized the [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] community of [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] under Virginia's Governor, Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]]. The colonists established their own small town, with a small Anglican church [[St. John's Episcopal Church (Hampton, Virginia)|(known now as St. John's Episcopal Church)]], on July 9, 1610.  This came to be known as part of Hampton. (Hampton claims to be the oldest continuously occupied English settlement in the United States).<ref name="tormey">{{cite book |last=Tormey |first=James |title=How Firm a Foundation |publisher=Diets Press |location=Richmond, Virginia |page=184 |date=April 2009 |isbn=978-0-87517-135-7}}</ref>  Hampton was named for [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]], an important leader of the [[Virginia Company of London]], for whom the [[Hampton River]], [[Hampton Roads]] and [[Southampton County, Virginia|Southampton County]] were also named. The area became part of [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] {{sic}} in 1619, [[Elizabeth River Shire]] in 1634, and was included in [[Elizabeth City County, Virginia|Elizabeth City County]] when it was formed in 1643.  By 1680, the settlement was known as Hampton, and it was incorporated as a town in 1705 and became the seat of Elizabeth City County.

In the latter part of August 1619, an English ship flying a Dutch flag, the ''White Lion'', appeared off shore from [[Point Comfort]]. Its cargo included 20 plus Africans captured from the [[slave ship]] ''Sao Joao Bautista''. These were the first Africans to come ashore on English-occupied land in what would become the United States.  [[John Rolfe]], the widower of [[Pocahontas]], wrote in a letter that he was at Point Comfort and witnessed the arrival of the first Africans. Although these first [[Bantu people|Bantu]] men from [[Angola]] were considered [[indentured servants]], their arrival marked the beginning of [[slavery]] in North America. Two of the first Africans to arrive at Old Point Comfort in 1619 were Antoney and Isabella.  Their child, the first of African descent born in North America, was born baptized January 1624.

Shortly after the [[War of 1812]], the US Army built a more substantial stone facility at Old Point Comfort. It was called [[Fort Monroe]] in honor of President [[James Monroe]]. The new installation and adjacent Fort Calhoun (on a man-made island across the channel) were completed in 1834.

Fort Monroe, Hampton and the surrounding area played several important roles during the [[American Civil War]] (1861–1865). Although most of Virginia became part of the [[Confederate States of America]], Fort Monroe remained in [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] hands. It became notable as a historic and symbolic site of early freedom for former [[slavery|slaves]] under the provisions of [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contraband]] policies and later the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. After the War, former Confederate President, [[Jefferson Davis]] was imprisoned in the area now known as the Casemate Museum on the base.

To the south of Fort Monroe, the Town of Hampton had the misfortune to be burned during both the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the [[American Civil War]]. From the ruins of Hampton left by evacuating Confederates in 1861, [[contraband (American Civil War)|"Contraband" slaves]] (formerly owned by Confederates and under a degree of Union protection) built the [[Grand Contraband Camp]], the first self-contained [[African American]] community in the United States. A number of modern-day Hampton streets retain their names from that community. The large number of contrabands who sought the refuge of Fort Monroe and the Grand Contraband Camp led to educational efforts which eventually included establishment of [[Hampton University]], site of the famous [[Emancipation Oak]].

The original site of the Native American's Kecoughtan Settlement was near the present site of a [[Hampton Roads Transit]] facility.<ref>[http://www.wm.edu/wmcar/pentran.html WMCAR - Historic Kecoughtan<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> To the south of present-day Hampton, a small unrelated [[incorporated town]] also named Kecoughtan many years later and also located in Elizabeth City County was annexed by the [[Newport News, Virginia|city of Newport News]] in 1927. It is now part of that city's [[East End (Newport News)|East End]].

Hampton was incorporated as a city in 1849.<ref name="hhistory"/>  On March 30, 1908, Hampton was separated from Elizabeth City County and became an independent city.<ref name="historical-county.newberry.org">http://historical-county.newberry.org/website/Virginia/documents/VA_Consolidated_Chronology.htm#Consolidated_Chronology</ref> However, it remained the [[county seat]] and continued to share many services with the county. On July 1, 1952, following approval of voters of each locality by referendum, the city of Hampton, the [[incorporated town]] of [[Phoebus, Virginia|Phoebus]] and Elizabeth City County merged into the independent city of Hampton.<ref name="historical-county.newberry.org"/> It was the first of a series of political consolidations in the [[Hampton Roads]] region during the third quarter of the 20th century.

===Modern military history===
Hampton also has a rich and extensive 20th-century military history, home of Langley Air Force Base, the nation's first military installation dedicated solely to airpower and the home of the U.S. Air Force's 633d Air Base Wing and 1st and 192nd Fighter Wings. Hampton has been a center of military aviation training, research and development for nearly a hundred years, from early prop planes and Zeppelins to rocket parts and advanced fighters. Its proximity to Norfolk means that Hampton has also long been home to many Navy families. Together many Air Force and Navy families in the Hampton area experienced significant losses both in war and also peacetime due to husbands and fathers in combat and also peacetime military accidents.

'''Langley AFB During the Vietnam War:''' In particular, during the Vietnam War, Langley Air Force Base was a designated 'waiting base' and thousands of Air Force families were transferred to Hampton from all over the world in order to wait while their husbands and fathers served in Vietnam.<ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008">Jose, Carol;  You Are Not Forgotten: A Family's Quest for Truth and the Founding of the National League of Families, New York Vandamere Press; First edition (September 1, 2008). (US), 2008. # ISBN 0-918339-71-5, # ISBN 978-0-918339-71-3.</ref> Thousands of Navy families associated with Naval bases in Norfolk next door also waited in Hampton during this era.<ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /> Vietnam was a very high casualty war for both Air Force and Navy pilots (some types of planes experienced a 50% casualty rate), and Naval "river rats" who fought on the rivers of the Mekong Delta experienced high casualties as well. There consequently accumulated over time, in the Hampton area, a high concentration of families of unnaccounted for wartime casualties.<ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" />  In many cases Hampton-stationed military families of "Missing in Action" or "Prisoner of War" pilots and sailors spent many years in the Hampton area waiting to find out what had happened to their missing or captured airmen and sailors, and so the service and, in some cases sacrifice, of these pilots, airmen, sailors and their families, despite not having lifelong connections to the area, are also a poignant and inspiring part of Hampton's history.<ref name="Jose, Carol; 2008" /><ref name="CSPAN video">Video of CSPAN special segment, Author Carol Jose speaks about book "You Are Not Forgotten" on the National League of Families, http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/282539-1</ref>

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Hampton Roads}}

===Roads and Highways===
In the Hampton Roads region, water crossings are a major issue for land-based transportation. The city is fortunate to have a good network of local streets and bridges to cross the various rivers and creeks. Many smaller bridges, especially those along [[Mercury Boulevard]], were named to honor the original NASA astronauts, who had trained extensively at NASA's Langley facilities.

The city is located contiguously to the neighboring independent cities of both Newport News and Poquoson. Many roads and streets are available to travel between them. Likewise, Williamsburg, Yorktown and the counties of James City and York are also located nearby in the Peninsula subregion, and many roads lead to them.

To reach most of its other neighbors in the [[South Hampton Roads]] subregion, it is necessary to cross the harbor and/or the mouth of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. There are 3 major motor vehicle crossings. Among these are the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] (HRBT) and the [[Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel]] (MMMBT), each forming part of the [[Hampton Roads Beltway]]. The HRBT is located on [[Interstate 64 in Virginia|Interstate 64]] near downtown Hampton and the MMMBT is a few miles away on [[Interstate 664]] near downtown Newport News. (These two major interstates converge in Hampton near the [[Hampton Coliseum]]). The third crossing option is the [[James River Bridge]], also in Newport News, which connects to [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight County]] and the town of [[Smithfield, Virginia|Smithfield]].

Hampton is also served by several major primary and secondary highways. These notably include [[U.S. Route 17 in Virginia|U.S. Routes 17]], [[Route 60 (Virginia)|60]] and [[U.S. Route 258 (Virginia)|258]], and [[Virginia State Route 134|Virginia State Routes 134]] and [[Virginia State Route 143|143]].

===Local and regional public transportation===
The Hampton Transit Center, located 2 West Pembroke Boulevard, at the intersection of King Street, close to the downtown area, offers a hub for local and intercity public transportation. It hosts HRT buses, Greyhound/Trailways services and taxicabs.

[[Hampton Roads Transit]] (HRT) is the local provider of transit service within the city, as well offering a regional bus system with routes to and from seven other cities in [[Hampton Roads]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrtransit.org/|title=- Hampton Roads Transit -|author=Hampton Roads Transit|publisher=|accessdate=5 December 2015}}</ref>

===Intercity bus service===
[[Intercity bus service]] is provided by [[Greyhound Lines]] and its Carolina Trailways affiliate. The buses serve the Hampton Transit Center. Low cost curbside intercity bus service is also provided by [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]], with service to Richmond, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Philadelphia.

===Amtrak===
Hampton is served by several [[Amtrak]] trains a day, with direct service from a station in nearby [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] (on [[Warwick Boulevard]] just west of Mercury Boulevard) through Williamsburg and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] to points along the [[Northeast Corridor]] from Washington DC through Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City all the way to Boston. At Richmond, connections can be made for other Amtrak destinations nationwide.

===Air===
Hampton is served by two commercial airports. [[Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport]] {{Airport codes|PHF}} is located in Newport News, and [[Norfolk International Airport]] {{Airport codes|ORF|KORF|ORF}}, is located across the harbor in Norfolk. Both are located along portions of [[Interstate 64 in Virginia|Interstate 64]].

The primary airport for the Virginia Peninsula is the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport located nearby in Newport News. Originally known as Patrick Henry Field (hence its airline code letters "PHF"), it was built on the site of Camp Patrick Henry, formerly a World War II facility. It is one of the fastest growing airports in the country, and it reported having served 1,058,839 passengers in 2005. The airport recently added a fourth airline carrier, Frontier Airlines, becoming the first new airline to come to the region in over eight years, despite the economic recession conditions.  2010 will likely be the busiest year by passenger count in the airport's history.<ref name="Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport">{{cite web
