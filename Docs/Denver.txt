Denver City was founded in November 1858 as a [[mining town]] during the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]] in western [[Kansas Territory]].<ref>{{cite web|date=January 1, 2006 |title=Denver: The Rocky Mountain metropolis time line |work=The City and County of Denver |url=http://www.denvergov.org/aboutdenver/history_timeline.asp |accessdate=August 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813180204/http://www.denvergov.org:80/aboutdenver/history_timeline.asp |archivedate=August 13, 2006 }}
</ref> That summer, a group of gold prospectors from [[Lawrence, Kansas]], had arrived and established [[Montana City, Colorado|Montana City]] on the banks of the [[South Platte River]]. This was the first settlement in what was later to become the city of Denver. The site faded quickly, however, and by the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor of [[Auraria, Denver|Auraria]] (named after the gold mining town of [[Auraria, Georgia]]), and St. Charles City.

On November 22, 1858, [[William Larimer, Jr.|General William Larimer]], a land speculator from eastern [[Kansas Territory]], placed [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]] logs to stake a claim on the bluff overlooking the confluence of the South Platte River and [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]], across the creek from the existing mining settlement of Auraria, and on the site of the existing townsite of St. Charles. Larimer named the town site Denver City to curry favor with Kansas Territorial Governor [[James W. Denver]].<ref name="DenverHistArapaho">{{cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/AboutDenver/history_narrative_1.asp |title=Denver History: The Arapaho Camp |author=Thomas J.

</ref> Larimer hoped that the town's name would help make it the [[county seat]] of Arapaho County, but unknown to him Governor Denver had already resigned from office. The location was accessible to existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of seasonal encampments of the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]]. The site of these first towns is now the site of [[Confluence Park]] near downtown Denver. Larimer, along with associates in the St. Charles City Land Company, sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners, with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new emigrants. Denver City was a frontier town, with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling, saloons, livestock and goods trading. In the early years, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria.<ref name="DenverHistArapaho"/> In May 1859, Denver City residents donated 53 lots to the Leavenworth & Pike's Peak Express in order to secure the region's first overland wagon route. Offering daily service for "passengers, mail, freight, and gold," the Express reached Denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six. In 1863, [[Western Union]] furthered Denver's dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus.

Although by the close of the 1860s, Denver residents could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through Cheyenne, rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. A daunting 100 miles away, citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to the transcontinental railroad. Spearheaded by visionary leaders including Territorial Governor [[John Evans (governor)|John Evans]], [[David Moffat]], and Walter Cheesman, fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders to take control of the debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the Denver Pacific completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.<ref>Baker, Gayle, ''Denver'', HarborTown Histories. Santa Barbara, CA, p. 31-33, ISBN 9780971098442 (print), 9780987903860 (on-line)</ref>

Finally linked to the rest of the nation by rail, Denver prospered as a service and supply center. The young city grew during these years, attracting millionaires with their mansions, as well as the poverty and crime of a rapidly growing city. Denver citizens were proud when the rich chose Denver and were thrilled that [[Horace Tabor]], the Leadville mining millionaire, built an impressive business block at 16th and Larimer as well as the elegant Tabor Grand Opera House. Luxurious hotels, including the much-loved [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]], soon followed, as well as splendid homes for millionaires like the Croke, Patterson, Campbell Mansion at 11th and Pennsylvania and the now-demolished Moffat Mansion at 8th and Grant.<ref>Baker, p. 39-48</ref> Intent on transforming Denver into one of the world's great cities, leaders wooed industry and enticed laborers to work in these factories. Soon, in addition to the elite and a large middle class, Denver had a growing population of German, Italian, and Chinese laborers, soon followed by African-Americans and Spanish-surname workers. Unprepared for this influx, the Silver Crash of 1893 unsettled political, social, and economic balances, laying the foundation for ethnic bigotry, such as the Red Scare and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, as well as corruption and crime.<ref>Baker, p. 51-55</ref>

Denver has also been known historically as the ''Queen City of the Plains'' and the ''Queen City of the West'', because of its important role in the [[agriculture in the United States|agricultural]] industry of the high-plains region in eastern Colorado and along the foothills of the [[Colorado Front Range]]. Several [[United States Navy|US Navy]] ships have been named [[USS Denver|USS ''Denver'']] in honor of the city.

Denver is located in the center of the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]], between the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west and the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] to the east. Denver's topography consists of plains in the city center with hilly areas to the north, west and south. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]] the city has a total area of {{convert|155|sqmi|sqkm|0}}, of which {{convert|153|sqmi|sqkm|0}} is land and {{convert|1.6|sqmi}} (1.1%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The City and County of Denver is surrounded by only three other counties: [[Adams County, Colorado|Adams County]] to the north and east, [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]] to the south and east, and [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]] to the west.

Although Denver's nickname is the "Mile-High City" because its official elevation is one mile above sea level, defined by the elevation of the spot of a benchmark on the steps of the State Capitol building, the elevation of the entire city ranges from {{convert|5130|to|5690|ft|m}}. According to [[Geographic Names Information System]] (GNIS) and the [[National Elevation Dataset]], the city's elevation is {{convert|5278|ft|m}}, which is reflected on various websites such as that of the [[National Weather Service]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?CityName=Denver&state=CO&site=BOU&textField1=39.768&textField2=-104.873&e=1&mp=0|title=NWS Point Forecast (with elevation data map) |publisher=Forecast.weather.gov |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2012}}</ref>

===Neighborhoods===
{{See also|List of Denver neighborhoods}}
[[File:Denveneighborhoods.gif|thumb|400px|Denver's 78 official neighborhoods]]
[[File:Denver.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Downtown Denver]]]]

As of January 2013, the City and County of Denver has defined 78 official [[neighborhood]]s that the city and community groups use for planning and administration.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://data.denvergov.org/dataset/city-and-county-of-denver-statistical-neighborhoods |title = Denver Open Data Catalog: Statistical Neighborhoods |author= City and County of Denver, Community Planning and Development |publisher= DenverGov.org}}</ref> Although the city's delineation of the neighborhood boundaries is somewhat arbitrary, it corresponds roughly to the definitions used by residents. These "neighborhoods" should not be confused with cities or suburbs, which may be separate entities within the metro area.

The character of the neighborhoods varies significantly from one to another and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material. Many neighborhoods away from the city center were developed after World War II, and are built with more modern materials and style. Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city have either very suburban characteristics or are [[new urbanism|new urbanist]] developments that attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods. Most neighborhoods contain parks or other features that are the focal point for the neighborhood.

Denver does not have larger area designations, [[Community areas in Chicago|unlike the City of Chicago]], which has larger areas that house the neighborhoods (IE: Northwest Side). Denver residents use the terms "north" "south" "east" and "west".<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://metroseeker.com/denver/where-to-live |title=Find A City To Love – Where to Live in Denver |publisher=MetroSeeker.com |date= |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Construction Cherokee.jpg|thumb|Construction along Cherokee Street in the Golden Triangle neighborhood.]]
Denver also has a number of neighborhoods not reflected in the administrative boundaries. These neighborhoods may reflect the way people in an area identify themselves or they might reflect how others, such as real estate developers, have defined those areas. Well-known non-administrative neighborhoods include the historic and trendy [[LoDo]] (short for "Lower Downtown"), part of the city's [[Union Station, Denver|Union Station neighborhood]]; Uptown, straddling [[North Capitol Hill, Denver, Colorado|North Capitol Hill]] and [[City Park West, Denver|City Park West]]; Curtis Park, part of the [[Five Points (Denver)|Five Points]] neighborhood; [[Alamo Placita, Denver|Alamo Placita]], the northern part of the [[Speer, Denver|Speer neighborhood]]; [[Park Hill, Denver|Park Hill]], a successful example of intentional racial integration;<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research |url=http://www.luc.edu/curl/projects/past/documents/cityscpe/vol4num2/ch5.html |title=Park Hill, Denver |volume=4 |issue=2 |year=1998 |last=Woods |first=Katherine |publisher=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development |pages=89–103 |accessdate=January 11, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904083433/http://www.luc.edu/curl/projects/past/documents/cityscpe/vol4num2/ch5.html |archivedate=September 4, 2006 }}</ref> and [[Golden Triangle, Denver|Golden Triangle]], in the Civic Center.

The Denver MSA has a gross metropolitan product of $157.6 billion in 2010, making it the 18th largest metro economy in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gross Metropolitan Product|url=http://greyhill.com/gross-metropolitan-product|publisher=Greyhill Advisors|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}</ref> Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection to some of the major transportation systems of the country. Because Denver is the largest city within {{convert|500|mi|km|-2}}, it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the [[Mountain States]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwest states]], as well as all [[Western United States|western states]]. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], such as Chicago and [[St. Louis]] and some large cities of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Over the years, the city has been home to other large corporations in the central United States, making Denver a key trade point for the country. Several well-known companies originated in or have relocated to Denver. William Ainsworth opened the Denver Instrument Company in 1895 to make analytical balances for gold assayers. Its factory is now in [[Arvada, Colorado|Arvada]]. [[AIMCO]] (NYSE: AIV)—the largest owner and operator of apartment communities in the United States, with approximately 870 communities comprising nearly 136,000 units in 44 states—is headquartered in Denver, employing approximately 3,500 people. Also [[Samsonite]] Corp., the world's largest luggage manufacturer, began in Denver in 1910 as Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company, but Samsonite closed its NE Denver factory in 2001, and moved its headquarters to [[Massachusetts]] after a change of ownership in 2006. The [[Qwest Corporation|Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Company]], founded in Denver in 1911, is now a part of telecommunications giant [[CenturyLink]].

[[MediaNews Group]] purchased the ''[[Denver Post]]'' in 1987; the company is based in Denver. The [[Gates Corporation]], the world's largest producer of automotive belts and hoses, was established in S. Denver in 1919. [[Russell Stover Candies]] Inc. made its first chocolate candy in Denver in 1923, but moved to Kansas City in 1969. The Wright & McGill Company has been making its Eagle Claw brand of fishing gear in NE Denver since 1925. The original [[Frontier Airlines (1950–1986)|Frontier Airlines]] began operations at Denver's old [[Stapleton International Airport]] in 1950. [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]] was reincarnated at [[Denver International Airport|DIA]] in 1994. Scott's Liquid Gold, Inc., has been making furniture polish in Denver since 1954. [[Village Inn]] restaurants began as a single pancake house in Denver in 1958. [[Big O Tires]], LLC, of [[Centennial, CO|Centennial]] opened its first franchise in 1962 in Denver. [[The Shane Company]] sold its first diamond jewelry in 1971 in Denver. [[Johns-Manville|Johns Manville]] Corp., a manufacturer of insulation and roofing products, relocated its headquarters to Denver from New York in 1972. [[CH2M HILL]] Inc., an engineering and construction firm, relocated from Oregon to the [[Denver Technological Center]] in 1980. The [[Ball Corporation]] sold its glass business in Indiana in the 1990s and moved to suburban [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]]. Ball has several operations in greater Denver.

[[Molson Coors Brewing Company]] established its U.S. headquarters in Denver in 2005. Its subsidiary and regional [[wholesale]] distributor, Coors Distributing Company, is in NW Denver. The [[Newmont Mining Corporation]], the 2nd largest gold producer in North America and one of the largest in the world, is headquartered in Denver.

Large Denver-area employers that have headquarters elsewhere include [[Lockheed Martin]] Corp., [[United Airlines]], [[Kroger]] Co. and [[Xcel Energy]], Inc. [http://company.mapquest.com/ MapQuest], an online site for maps, directions and business listings, is headquartered in Denver's LODO district.
[[File:Union Station Development.jpg|thumb|Development in the bustling Union Station section of downtown.]]
Geography also allows Denver to have a considerable government presence, with many federal agencies based or having offices in the Denver area. Along with federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects, and more jobs are brought to the city by virtue of its being the capital of the state of [[Colorado]]. The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]], the [[Denver Federal Center]], [[Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse]], the [[Denver Mint]], and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]].

In 2005, a $310.7 million expansion for the [[Colorado Convention Center]] was completed, doubling its size. The hope was that the center's expansion would elevate the city to one of the top 10 cities in the nation for holding a convention.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/conventioncenter/ci_0002809415 |title=Finally, it's built.

Denver's position near the mineral-rich [[Rocky Mountains]] encouraged mining and energy companies to spring up in the area. In the early days of the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the economic success of the city. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America and resulting high oil prices created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]''. Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers. When the price of oil dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, the Denver economy dropped with it, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including former mayor and current governor [[John Hickenlooper]], a former geologist), and the highest office vacancy rate in the nation (30%).<ref>{{cite web |title=Denver: The Rocky Mountain Metropolis History |url=http://www.denvergov.org/aboutdenver/history_timeline_short.asp |date=2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060608124619/http://www.denvergov.org/AboutDenver/history_timeline_short.asp |archive-date=June 8, 2006 |website=The City and County of Denver |access-date=February 27, 2016}}</ref> Since then, the industry has recovered and there remain 700 employed petroleum engineers in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegedegreereport.com/city-data/petroleum-engineers/denver-aurora |title=Welcome collegedegreereport.com - BlueHost.com |website=Collegedegreereport.com |date= |accessdate=2016-04-07}}</ref> Advances is hydraulic fracturing has made the DJ Basin of Colorado into an accessible and lucrative oil play. Energy and mining are still important in Denver's economy today, with companies such as [[EnCana]], [[Halliburton]], [[Smith International]], [[Rio Tinto Group]], [[Newmont Mining]], [[Noble Energy]], and [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation|Anadarko]] headquartered or having significant operations in the area.

Denver's west-central geographic location in the Mountain Time Zone (UTC−7) also benefits the telecommunications industry by allowing communication with both North American coasts, South America, Europe, and Asia in the same business day. Denver's location on the 105th meridian at over one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) in elevation also enables it to be the largest city in the U.S. to offer a "one-bounce" real-time satellite uplink to six continents in the same business day. [[Qwest Communications]], [[Dish Network Corporation]], [[Starz (TV network)|Starz-Encore]], [[DIRECTV]], and [[Comcast]] are a few of the many telecommunications companies with operations in the Denver area. These and other high-tech companies had a boom in Denver in the mid to late 1990s. Denver had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at 3.8% in October 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrodenver.org/metro-denver-economy/monthly-summary |title=Monthly Economic Summary |author=Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation |publisher=Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation|date=October 2, 2007 |accessdate=November 26, 2007}}</ref> As of April 2015, the unemployment rate for the Denver-Aurora-Broomfield MSA is 4.2%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.co_denver_msa.htm |title=Denver-Aurora-Broomfield, CO Economy at a Glance |author=The Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=The Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref> The Downtown region has seen increased real estate investment with the construction of several new skyscrapers set to be completed in 2010–2013.

Denver has also enjoyed success as a pioneer in the fast casual restaurant industry, with many popular national chain restaurants founded and based in Denver. [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]], [[Quizno's]], and [[Smashburger]] were founded and headquartered in Denver. [[Qdoba Mexican Grill]], [[Noodles & Company]], and [[Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard]] originated in Denver, but have moved their headquarters to the nearby suburbs of [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado|Wheat Ridge]], [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]], and [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]].

Denver is home to a variety of sports teams and is one of the [[U.S. cities with teams from four major sports]] (the Denver metro area is the smallest metropolitan area to have a team in all four major sports). The [[Denver Broncos]] of the [[National Football League]] have drawn crowds of over 70,000 since their origins in the early 1960s, and continue to draw fans today to their current home [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]].

Denver has several additional professional teams. In 2006 Denver established a Major League Lacrosse team, the [[Denver Outlaws]]. They play in [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High]]. In 2006, the Denver Outlaws won the Western Conference Championship. The [[Colorado Mammoth]] of the National Lacrosse League play at the Pepsi Center. The [[Denver PRO Rugby team]] plays at [[Infinity Park]].

Denver submitted the winning bid to host the [[1976 Winter Olympics]], but subsequently withdrew, giving it the dubious distinction of being the only city to back out after winning a bid to host the Olympics.<ref name=1970Olympics/> Denver and Colorado Springs hosted the [[1962 World Ice Hockey Championships]].

==Parks and recreation==
{{As of|2006}}, Denver had over 200 parks, from small mini-parks all over the city to the giant {{convert|314|acre|km2}} [[City Park, Denver|City Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/parks/|title=Denver Parks & Recreation: Parks Division|publisher=City and County of Denver|accessdate=August 18, 2006}}</ref> Denver also has 29 recreation centers providing places and programming for resident's recreation and relaxation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denvergov.org/TabId/37910/TopicId/1434/default.aspx |title=Recreation Centers and Programs |publisher=City and County of Denver |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070909091536/http://www.denvergov.org:80/TabId/37910/TopicId/1434/default.aspx |archivedate=9 September 2007 |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref>

[[File:denver 16th st.jpg|thumb|left|Chess players on the [[16th Street Mall]].]]Many of Denver's parks were acquired from state lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This coincided with the [[City Beautiful]] movement, and Denver mayor [[Robert W. Speer|Robert Speer]] (1904–12 and 1916–18) set out to expand and beautify the city's parks. Reinhard Schuetze was the city's first [[landscape architect]], and he brought his German-educated landscaping genius to [[Washington Park, Denver|Washington Park]], [[Cheesman Park, Denver|Cheesman Park]], and [[City Park, Denver|City Park]] among others. Speer used Schuetze as well as other landscape architects such as [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] and [[Saco Rienk DeBoer]] to design not only parks such as [[Civic Center, Denver|Civic Center Park]], but many city parkways and tree-lawns. All of this greenery was fed with [[South Platte River]] water diverted through the city ditch.<ref>Etter, Carolyn and Don. City of Parks: The Preservation of Denver's Park and Parkway System.

In addition to the parks within Denver itself, the city acquired land for [[Denver Mountain Parks|mountain parks]] starting in the 1911s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mountainparkshistory.org/Parks/index.html |title=Denver Mountain Parks History: Park Descriptions |publisher=Denver Mountain Parks Foundation |accessdate=September 26, 2007}}</ref> Over the years, Denver has acquired, built and maintained approximately {{convert|14000|acre|km2}} of mountain parks, including [[Red Rocks Park]], which is known for its scenery and musical history revolving around the unique [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/Mountain_Parks |title=Denver Mountain Parks |publisher=City and County of Denver |accessdate=September 26, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013125051/http://www.denvergov.org/Mountain_Parks |archivedate = October 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denvergov.org/Mountain_Parks/MountainParks/MountainParks21/tabid/391213/Default.aspx |title=Denver Mountain Parks: Red Rocks Park |publisher=City and County of Denver |accessdate=September 26, 2007|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013125051/http://www.denvergov.org/Mountain_Parks |archivedate = October 13, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Denver also owns the mountain on which the [[Winter Park Resort]] ski area is operated in [[Grand County, Colorado|Grand County]], {{convert|67|mi|km|-1}} west of Denver.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1216/is_1_204/ai_58517783 |title=Winter's tale&nbsp;– Winter Park Resort in Colorado |author=Lora J.

Denver continues to grow its park system with the development of many new parks along the Platte River through the city, and with Central Park and [[Bluff Lake Nature Center]] in the [[Stapleton International Airport|Stapleton]] neighborhood redevelopment. All of these parks are important gathering places for residents and allow what was once a dry plain to be lush, active, and green. Denver is also home to a large network of public [[community gardens]], most of which are managed by [[Denver Urban Gardens]], a non-profit organization.[[File:Dmp.JPG|thumb|[[Genesee Park (Colorado)|Genesee Park]] is the largest of the Denver Mountain Parks.]]

Since 1974, Denver and the surrounding jurisdictions have rehabilitated the urban South Platte River and its tributaries for recreational use by hikers and cyclists. The main stem of the South Platte River Greenway runs along the South Platte from [[Chatfield Dam|Chatfield Reservoir]] {{convert|35|mi|km}} into Adams County in the north. The Greenway project is recognized as one of the best urban reclamation projects in the U.S., winning, for example, the Silver Medal [[Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence]] in 2001.<ref name="Bruner Foundation">{{cite web|title=Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence|url=http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba|publisher=Bruner Foundation|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}</ref>

In its 2013 ParkScore ranking, [[Trust for Public Land|The Trust for Public Land]], a national land conservation organization, reported that Denver had the 17th best park system among the 50 most populous U.S. cities.<ref>[http://parkscore.tpl.org/city.php?city=Denver "City Profiles: Denver"].

==Government==
{{Main|Government of Denver}}
[[File:Denver City Hall 1941.jpg|thumb|Denver City and County Building (circa 1941), looking west.]]

[[File:Coloradocapitolhill2.JPG|thumb|[[Colorado State Capitol]] looking east.]]

Denver is a [[consolidated city-county]] with a mayor elected on a [[nonpartisan]] ballot, a 13-member [[city council]] and an [[auditor]]. The [[Denver City Council]] is elected from 11 districts with two at-large council-members and is responsible for passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and ordinances, usually after a public hearing, and can also call for misconduct investigations of Denver's departmental officials. All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. The current mayor is [[Michael Hancock (Colorado politician)|Michael Hancock]].

Denver has a strong mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can approve or veto any ordinances or [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s approved by the council, makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs all bonds and contracts, is responsible for the city budget, and can appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and commissions. However, the council can override the mayor's veto with a nine out of thirteen member vote, and the city budget must be approved and can be changed by a simple majority vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually based on financial reasons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Our City Government Works |url=https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/city-of-denver-home/government/city-overview.html |date=2016 |publisher=City and County of Denver |access-date=February 5, 2016}}</ref>

The Denver Department of Safety oversees three branches: the [[Denver Police Department]], [[Denver Fire Department]], and [[Denver Sheriff Department]]. The Denver County Court is an integrated [[Colorado County Courts|Colorado County Court]] and Municipal Court and is managed by Denver instead of the state.

===Politics===
While Denver elections are non-partisan, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have long held the majority sway on Denver politics with most officials elected citywide having Democratic Party affiliation. In federal elections, Denverites also tend to vote for Democratic candidates, voting for the Democratic Presidential nominee in every election since 1960 (excluding 1980 and 1972). The office of Denver's Mayor has been occupied by a Democrat since the municipal general election of 1963. Denver is represented at the federal level by congresswoman [[Diana DeGette]], a Democrat representing [[Colorado's 1st congressional district]], which includes all of Denver and parts of [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]].

[[Benjamin F. Stapleton]] was the mayor of Denver, Colorado, for two periods, the first from 1923 to 1931 and the second from 1935 to 1947. Stapleton was responsible for many civic improvements during his term, notably during his second stint as mayor when he had access to funds and manpower from the [[New Deal]]. During this time, the park system was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amidst heavy criticism. It was later renamed [[Stapleton International Airport]] in his honor. Today, the airport no longer stands, but has been replaced by a neighborhood also named Stapleton. Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Denver was one of the epicenters of the [[Chicano Movement]]. The boxer-turned-activist [[Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales]] formed an organization called the Crusade for Justice, which battled police brutality, fought for bilingual education, and, most notably, hosted the First National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference in March 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicanomoratorium.org/html/history_timeline.html |title=History Timeline |publisher=Chicanomoratorium.org |date= |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref>

In recent years, Denver has taken a stance on helping people who are or become [[Homelessness|homeless]], particularly under the administrations of mayors [[John Hickenlooper]] and [[Wellington Webb]]. At a rate of 19 homeless per 10,000 residents in 2011 as compared to 50 or more per 10,000 residents for the four metro areas with the highest rate of homelessness,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.endhomelessness.org/page/-/files/4361_file_Appendix_One.pdf |title=Homelessness in Large Metro Areas |publisher=Endhomelessness.org |date= |accessdate=December 31, 2015}}</ref> Denver's homeless population and rate of homeless are both considerably lower than many other major cities.  However, residents of the city streets suffer Denver winters - which, although mild and dry much of the time, can have brief periods of extremely cold temperatures and snow.

In 2005, Denver became the first major city in the U.S. to vote to make the private possession of less than an ounce of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] legal for adults 21 and older.<ref name=DenverPot>O'Driscoll, Patrick.[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-11-03-pot_x.htm Denver votes to legalize marijuana possession].

It also hosted the [[G8|G7]] (now G8) summit between June 20 and 22 in 1997 and the 2000 National Convention of the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2000/past_summit/table_e/index.html |title=List of Summit Meetings |publisher=MOFA |date= |accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Democratic National Convention |url=http://www.pepsicenter.com/Events/Event.aspx?eid=jBjB9FSNi20 |date=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229204519/http://www.pepsicenter.com/Events/Event.aspx?eid=jBjB9FSNi20 |archive-date=February 29, 2012 |website=[[Pepsi Center]] |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref>

On October 31, 2011 it was announced that [[The University of Denver]] in Denver was selected as the host of the first of three 2012 presidential debates to be held on October 3, 2012.

===Taxes===
The City and County of Denver levies an Occupational Privilege Tax (OPT or Head Tax) on employers and employees.
*If any employee performs work in the city limits and is paid over $500 for that work in a single month, the employee and employer are both liable for the OPT regardless of where the main business office is located or headquartered.
*The employer is liable for $4 per employee per month and the employee is liable for $5.75 per month.
*It is the employer's responsibility to withhold, remit, and file the OPT returns. If an employer does not comply, the employer can be held liable for both portions of the OPT as well as penalties and interest.

Denver's many colleges and universities range in age and study programs. Three major public schools constitute the [[Auraria Campus]], [[University of Colorado Denver]], [[Metropolitan State University of Denver]], and [[Community College of Denver]]. The private [[University of Denver]] was the first institution of higher learning in the city and was founded in 1864. Other prominent Denver higher education institutions include [[Johnson & Wales University]], Catholic ([[Jesuit]]) [[Regis University]] and the city has Roman Catholic and Jewish institutions, as well as a health sciences school. In addition to those schools within the city, there are a number of schools located throughout the surrounding metro area.

For a list of radio stations, see [[List of radio stations in Colorado|Radio Stations in Colorado]]

===Print===
After a continued rivalry between Denver's two main newspapers, the ''[[Denver Post]]'' and ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', the papers merged operations in 2001 under a Joint Operating Agreement which formed the Denver Newspaper Agency<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denvernewspaperagency.com |title= Denver Newspaper Agency|accessdate=December 15, 2006}}</ref> until February 2009 when [[E. W. Scripps Company]], the owner of the Rocky Mountain News closed the paper. There are also several alternative or localized newspapers published in Denver, including the ''[[Westword]]'' and ''[[Out Front Colorado]]''. Denver is home to multiple regional magazines such as ''[[5280]]'', which takes its name from the city's mile-high ({{convert|5280|ft|m|0|disp=or|sp=us}}) elevation.

==Transportation==
[[File:Sunrise Over Denver Skyline.jpg|centre|thumb|541x541px|Dawn casts a glow over the [[Front Range]] west of downtown.]]

===City streets===
{{Main|Street system of Denver}}
[[File:Colfaxatbroadway.JPG|thumb|upright|Colfax Avenue at Broadway, where the downtown street grid and the "normal" city grid meet. Colfax Avenue carries [[U.S. Route 40 in Colorado|U.S. Highway 40]] through Denver.]]

Most of Denver has a straightforward [[street grid]] oriented to the four [[cardinal direction]]s. Blocks are usually identified in hundreds from the median streets, identified as "00", which are Broadway (the east–west median, running north–south) and Ellsworth Avenue (the north–south median, running east–west). [[Colfax Avenue]], a major east–west artery through Denver, is 15 blocks (1500) north of the median. Avenues north of Ellsworth are numbered (with the exception of Colfax Avenue and several others, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd and Montview Blvd.), while avenues south of Ellsworth are named.

There is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be parallel to the confluence of the [[South Platte River]] and [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]]. Most of the streets downtown and in [[LoDo]] run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]]. There is now a plaque across the street from the [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]] which honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after [[William Larimer, Jr.]], the founder of Denver, which is located in the heart of [[LoDo]], is the oldest street in Denver.

[[File:Speer Boulevard Denver.JPG|thumb|Speer Blvd runs north and south through downtown Denver]]

All roads in the downtown grid system are streets (e.g. [[16th Street Mall|16th Street]], Stout Street). Roads outside that system that travel east/west are given the suffix "avenue" and those that head north and south are given the "street" suffix (e.g. Colfax Avenue, Lincoln Street). Boulevards are higher capacity streets and travel any direction (more commonly north and south). Smaller roads are sometimes referred to as places, drives (though not all drives are smaller capacity roads, some are major thoroughfares) or courts. Most streets outside the area between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard are organized alphabetically from the city's center.

Many Denver streets have [[bicycle lanes]], and there are over 850 miles<ref name="denver.org">{{cite web |title=Denver's 850 Miles of Off-Road Bike Trails |url=http://www.denver.org/metro/features/bike-trails |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821123833/http://denver.org/metro/features/bike-trails |archive-date=August 21, 2008 |publisher=Denver Metro Convention & Visitors Bureau |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref> of paved, off-road, bike paths in Denver parks and along bodies of water, like Cherry Creek and the South Platte.

The B-Cycle network was the largest in the United States at the time of its launch, boasting 400 bicycles.<ref name="Cnet"/> Through the acquisition of new grants, the program has continued to expand each year, adding dozens of new stations, hundreds of bikes, and by beginning service during the winter months.<ref>{{cite web|title=Denver City Council passes Denver B-Cycle expansion|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_21727821/denver-city-council-passes-denver-b-cycle-expansion|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Denver B-cycle goes to year-round schedule|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_24050323/denver-b-cycle-goes-year-round-schedule|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>

===Walkability===

===Freeways and highways===
Denver is primarily served by the interstate freeways [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] and [[Interstate 70 (Colorado)|I-70]]. The intersection of the two interstates is referred to locally as "[[Mousetrap (Denver)|the mousetrap]]", because when viewed from the air, the junction (and subsequent vehicles) resemble mice in a large trap.
* [[File:I-25 (CO).svg|25px]] '''[[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]]''' runs north–south from [[New Mexico]] through Denver to [[Wyoming]]
* [[File:I-225 (CO).svg|25px]] '''[[Interstate 225 (Colorado)|Interstate 225]]''' traverses neighboring [[Aurora, Colorado|Aurora]]. I-225 was designed to link Aurora with I-25 in the southeastern corner of Denver, and I-70 to the north of Aurora, with construction starting May 1964 and ending May 21, 1976.
* [[File:I-70 (CO).svg|25px]] '''[[Interstate 70 (Colorado)|Interstate 70]]''' runs east–west from [[Utah]] to [[Maryland]].
* [[File:I-270 (CO).svg|25px]] '''[[Interstate 270 (Colorado)|Interstate 270]]''' runs concurrently with [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]] from an interchange with [[Interstate 70 (Colorado)|Interstate 70]] in northeast Denver to an interchange with [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] north of Denver. The freeway continues as [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]] from the interchange with [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]].
* [[File:I-76 (CO).svg|25px]] '''[[Interstate 76 (Colorado)|Interstate 76]]''' begins from I-70 just west of the city in [[Arvada, Colorado|Arvada]]. It intersects I-25 north of the city and runs northeast to Nebraska where it ends at [[Interstate 80 (Nebraska)|I-80]].
* [[File:US 6.svg|25px]] '''[[U.S. Highway 6 (Colorado)|US 6]]''' follows the alignment of 6th Avenue west of I-25, and connects downtown Denver to the west-central suburbs of [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]] and [[Lakewood, Colorado|Lakewood]]. It continues west through Utah and Nevada to Bishop, California. To the east, it continues as far as Provincetown, on Cape Cod in Massachusetts.
* [[File:US 36.svg|25px]] '''[[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]]''' connects Denver to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Rocky Mountain National Park]] near [[Estes Park, Colorado|Estes Park]]. It runs east into [[Ohio]], after crossing four other states.
* [[File:Colorado 470.svg|25px]]'''State Highway 470''' ('''C-470''', '''SH 470''') is the southwestern portion of the Denver metro area's beltway. Originally planned as Interstate 470 in the 1960s, the beltway project was attacked on environmental impact grounds and the interstate beltway was never built. The portion of "Interstate 470" that was built as a [[state highway]] is the present-day SH 470, which is a [[freeway]] for its entire length.

Denver also has a nearly complete beltway known as "the 470's". These are [[SH 470 (CO)|SH 470]] (also known as C-470), a freeway in the southwest Metro area, and two toll highways, [[E-470]] (from southeast to northeast) and [[Northwest Parkway]] (from terminus of E-470 to [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]]). SH 470 was originally intended to be I-470 and built with federal highway funds, but the funding was redirected to complete conversion of downtown Denver's [[16th Street Mall|16th Street]] to a pedestrian mall. As a result, construction was delayed until 1980 after state and local legislation was passed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew E. Salek |url=http://www.mesalek.com/colo/denvers470.html |title=C-470? E-470? I-470? W-470? I give up! |publisher=Mesalek.com |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}</ref>  I-470 was also once called "The Silver Stake Highway", from Gov. Lamm's declared intention to drive a silver stake through it and kill it.

A highway expansion and transit project for the southern [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] corridor, dubbed T-REX ([[Transportation Expansion Project]]), was completed on November 17, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=T-REX Announces Opening Day for Southeast Light Rail Line |url=http://www.denvergov.org/Southeast_Corridor/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures2005/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures20055/tabid/393990/Default.aspx |date=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20071013125106/http://denvergov.org:80/Southeast_Corridor/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures2005/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures20055/tabid/393990/Default.aspx |archive-date=13 October 2007 |publisher=City and County of Denver |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref> The project installed wider and additional highway lanes, and improved highway access and drainage. The project also includes a light rail line that traverses from downtown to the south end of the metro area at Lincoln Avenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5151700,00.html |title=New light rail heads on down the tracks |publisher=Rocky Mountain News |accessdate=September 26, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013114548/http://rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_5151700,00.html |archivedate = October 13, 2007}}</ref> The project spanned almost {{convert|19|mi|km|0}} along the highway with an additional line traveling parallel to part of [[Interstate 225 (Colorado)|I-225]], stopping just short of Parker Road.

[[Public transport|Mass transportation]] throughout the [[Denver metropolitan area]] is managed and coordinated by the [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD). RTD currently operates more than 1,000 [[bus]]es serving over 10,000 bus stops in 38 municipal jurisdictions in eight counties around the [[Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area|Denver and Boulder metropolitan areas]]. Additionally, RTD operates seven [[TheRide|rail]] lines, the A, C, D, E, F, W, and H with a total of {{convert|57.9|mi|km}} of track, serving 44 stations. All lines are light rail except the A, a commuter rail line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtd-denver.com/LightRail/index.html |title=Light Rail |publisher=RTD Denver |accessdate=September 26, 2007}}</ref> [[FasTracks]] is a light rail/bus/rail expansion project approved by voters in 2004 which will serve neighboring suburbs and communities. The W line, or West line, opened in April 2013 serving Golden/Federal Center.

[[Colorado Department of Transportation|CDOT]] runs a bus system named Bustang that offers weekday service between Union Station in Denver, [[Glenwood Springs]], [[Colorado Springs]], and [[Fort Collins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_27921710/cdots-statewide-bustang-service-to-start-july-13 |title=Bustang Start |publisher= Denver Post|accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref>
[[File:Union Station, Opening Day.jpg|thumb|Union Station train shed, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, on opening day of the A line to DIA.]]
[[Greyhound Lines]], the [[intercity bus]] operator, has a major hub in Denver, with routes to [[New York City]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Las Vegas]], and their headquarters, [[Dallas]]. Subsidiary [[Autobuses Americanos]] provides service to [[El Paso]]. Allied bus operators Black Hills Trailways, and [[Burlington Trailways]] provide service to [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]].

[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Denver, operating its ''[[California Zephyr]]'' daily in both directions between [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]] and [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], California, across the bay from San Francisco. Amtrak Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the Denver station with Rocky Mountain points.

At Albuquerque, New Mexico, Denver Thruway connections are made daily with the Amtrak ''[[Southwest Chief]]''. Additionally, the [[Ski Train]] operated on the former [[Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad]], which took passengers between Denver and the [[Winter Park, Colorado|Winter Park]] Ski Resort, but it is no longer in service. The Ski Train made its final run to Winter Park on March 29, 2009.

Denver's early years as a major train hub of the west are still very visible today. Trains stop in Denver at historic [[Union Station (Denver)|Union Station]], where travelers can access RTD's 16th Street Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city. [[Union Station (Denver)|Union Station]] will also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, at the completion of [[FasTracks]].

===Airports===

[[Denver International Airport]] (IATA: DEN, ICAO: KDEN), commonly known as DIA, serves as the primary airport for a large region surrounding Denver. DIA is located {{convert|18.6|mi|km|0|sp=us}} east-northeast of the [[Colorado State Capitol]]. DIA is the tenth busiest airport in the world and ranks fourth in the United States, with 51,245,334 passengers passing through it in 2008.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/business/ci_7183877|work=Denver Post |accessdate=October 15, 2007|title=DIA ranks fourth-busiest|first=Kelly |last=Yamanouchi |date=October 15, 2007}}</ref> It covers more than {{convert|53|sqmi|1}}, making it the largest airport by land area in the United States and larger than the island of [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.flightmapping.com/features/biggest-busiest-airports|title=Which Airport Is The World's Biggest?

Three [[general aviation]] airports serve the Denver area. [[Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport]] (KBJC) is {{convert|13.7|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north-northwest, [[Centennial Airport]] (KAPA) is {{convert|13.7|mi|km|0|sp=us}} south-southeast, and [[Front Range Airport]] (KFTG) is located {{convert|23.7|mi|km|0|sp=us}} east of the state capitol.

In the past, Denver has been home to several other airports that are no longer operational. [[Stapleton International Airport]] was closed in 1995 when it was replaced by DIA. [[Lowry Air Force Base]] was a military flight training facility that ceased flight operations in 1966, with the base finally being closed in 1994. It is currently being used for residential purposes. [[Buckley Air Force Base]], a former [[Air National Guard]] base, is currently the only military facility in the Denver-Metro area.
