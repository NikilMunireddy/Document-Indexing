'''Henry VII''' (before accession known as '''Henry Tudor, 2nd Earl of Richmond''', {{lang-cy|Harri Tudur}}; 28 January 1457 – 21 April 1509) was [[Kingdom of England|King of England]], ruled the [[Principality of Wales]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nathenamin.com/2013/03/01/henry-tudor-proud-welshman/|title=Henry Tudor, a Proud Welshman|work=Nathen Amin}}</ref> (until 29 November 1489) and [[Lordship of Ireland|Lord of Ireland]] from his seizing the crown on 22 August 1485 until his death on 21 April 1509, as the first monarch of the [[House of Tudor]].

Henry won the throne when his forces defeated the forces of [[Richard III of England|King Richard III]] at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], the culmination of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Henry was the last king of England to win his throne on the field of battle. He cemented his claim by marrying [[Elizabeth of York]], daughter of [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and niece of Richard III.  Henry was successful in restoring the power and stability of the English monarchy after the political upheavals of the civil wars known as the [[Wars of the Roses]]. He founded the Tudor dynasty and, after a reign of nearly 24 years, was peacefully succeeded by his son, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].

Although Henry can be credited with the restoration of political stability in England, and a number of commendable administrative, economic and diplomatic initiatives, the latter part of his reign was characterised by a financial greed which stretched the bounds of legality.  The capriciousness and lack of due process which indebted many in England were soon ended upon Henry VII's death after a commission revealed widespread abuses.<ref>Thomas Penn.

==Ancestry and early life==
[[File:Pembroke Castle 1.jpg|thumb|left|Pembroke Castle]]
[[File:Younghenry7.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Young Henry VII, by a French artist ([[Musée Calvet]], [[Avignon]])]]

Henry VII was born at [[Pembroke Castle]] on 28 January 1457 to [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond]]. His father, [[Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond]], died three months before his birth.<ref>Caroline Rogers and Roger Turvey, ''Henry VII'', London: Hodder Murray, 2005</ref>

Henry's paternal grandfather, [[Owen Tudor]], originally from the [[Tudors of Penmynydd]], Isle of [[Anglesey]] in Wales, had been a page in the court of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. He rose to become one of the "Squires to the Body to the King" after military service at [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kendall, Paul Murray |title=Richard the Third |page=13 }}</ref> Owen is said to have secretly married the widow of Henry V, [[Catherine of Valois]]. One of their sons was Edmund Tudor, father of Henry VII. Edmund was created [[Earl of Richmond]] in 1452, and "formally declared legitimate by Parliament".<ref name="Williams17">{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=17}}</ref>

Henry's main claim to the English throne derived from his mother through the [[House of Beaufort]]. Henry's mother, Lady Margaret Beaufort, was a great-granddaughter of [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], Duke of Lancaster, fourth son of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and his third wife [[Katherine Swynford]]. Katherine was Gaunt's mistress for about 25 years; when they married in 1396, they already had four children, including Henry's great-grandfather [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort]]. Thus Henry's claim was somewhat tenuous: it was from a woman, and by illegitimate descent. In theory, the Portuguese and Castilian royal families had a better claim (as far as "legitimacy" is concerned) as descendants of [[Catherine of Lancaster]], the daughter of John of Gaunt and his second wife [[Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster|Constance of Castile]].

Gaunt's nephew [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] legitimised Gaunt's children by Katherine Swynford by [[Letters Patent]] in 1397. In 1407, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], who was Gaunt's son by his first wife, issued new Letters Patent confirming the legitimacy of his half-siblings, but also declaring them ineligible for the throne.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kendall, Paul Murray |title=Richard the Third |page=156 }}</ref> Henry IV's action was of doubtful legality, as the Beauforts were previously legitimised by an [[Act of Parliament]], but it further weakened Henry's claim.

Nonetheless, by 1483 Henry was the senior male [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] claimant remaining, after the deaths in battle or by murder or execution of [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]], his son [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]], and the other Beaufort line of descent through Lady Margaret's uncle, the [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset|2nd Duke of Somerset]].

Henry also made some political capital out of his Welsh ancestry, for example in attracting military support and safeguarding his army's passage through Wales on its way to the Battle of Bosworth.<ref name="Chrimes, S.B. 3">{{cite book |author=Chrimes, S.B. |title=Henry VII |page=3 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Davies, Norman |title=The Isles – A History |pages=337–379 }}</ref> He came from an old-established Anglesey family which claimed descent from [[Cadwaladr]] (in legend, the last ancient British king)<ref name="Mackie, J.D. 47">{{cite book |author=Mackie, J.D. |title=The Earlier Tudors 1485–1558 |page=47 }}</ref> and on occasion, Henry displayed the red dragon of Cadwaladr.<ref name="Chrimes, S.B. 3"/> He took it, as well as the standard of [[St George's Cross|St George]], on his procession through London after victory at Bosworth.<ref name="Mackie, J.D. 54">{{cite book |author=Mackie, J.D. |title=The Earlier Tudors 1485–1558 |page=54 }}</ref> A contemporary writer and Henry's biographer, [[Bernard André]], also made much of Henry's Welsh descent.<ref name="Mackie, J.D. 47"/>

In reality, however, his hereditary connections to Welsh aristocracy were not strong. He was descended by the paternal line, through several generations, from [[Ednyfed Fychan]], the seneschal (steward) of Gwynedd and through this seneschal's wife from [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]], the King of [[Deheubarth]] in South Wales.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chrimes, S.B. |title=Henry VII |page=4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Ashley, Mike |title=The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens |page=331 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Garmon Jones, W |title=Welsh Nationalism and Henry Tudor |page=30 }}</ref>

His more immediate ancestor Tudur ap Goronwy had aristocratic land rights, but his sons, who were first cousins to [[Owain Glyndŵr]], sided with Owain in his revolt. One son was executed and the family land was forfeited. Another son, Henry's great-grandfather, became a butler to the Bishop of Bangor.<ref name="Mackie, J.D. 54"/> Owen Tudor, the son of the butler, like the children of other rebels, was provided for by Henry V, a circumstance which precipitated his access to Queen Catherine of Valois.<ref>{{cite book |author=Chrimes, S.B. |title=Henry VII |pages=4–5 }}</ref>

Notwithstanding this lineage, to the bards of Wales, Henry was a candidate for [[Y Mab Darogan]] – "The Son of Prophecy" who would free the Welsh from oppression.

In 1456, Henry's father Edmund Tudor was captured while fighting for [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in South Wales against the [[House of York|Yorkists]]. He died in [[Carmarthen Castle]], three months before Henry was born. Henry's uncle [[Jasper Tudor]], the Earl of Pembroke and Edmund's younger brother, undertook to protect the young widow, who was 13 years old when she gave birth to Henry.<ref>{{cite book |author=Starkey, David |title=Monarchy: From the Middle Ages to Modernity |page=4 }}</ref> When [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] became King in 1461, Jasper Tudor went into exile abroad. Pembroke Castle, and later the [[Earl of Pembroke|Earldom of Pembroke]], were granted to the Yorkist [[William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke (1468 creation)|William Herbert]], who also assumed the guardianship of Margaret Beaufort and the young Henry.<ref>{{cite web|author=Marilee Mongello |url=http://englishhistory.net/tudor/monarchs/henry7.html |title=Tudor Monarchs – Henry VII, one |publisher=Englishhistory.net |date= |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>

Henry lived in the Herbert household until 1469, when [[Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick]] (the "Kingmaker"), went over to the Lancastrians. Herbert was captured fighting for the Yorkists and executed by Warwick.<ref name="Williams19">{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=19}}</ref> When Warwick restored Henry VI in 1470, Jasper Tudor returned from exile and brought Henry to court.<ref name="Williams19"/> When the Yorkist [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] regained the throne in 1471, Henry fled with other Lancastrians to [[Brittany]], where he spent most of the next 14 years under the protection of [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]]. In November 1476, Henry's protector fell ill and his principle advisers were more amenable to negotiating with the English king. Henry was handed over and escorted to the Breton port of Saint-Malo. While there, he feigned stomach cramps and in the confusion fled into a monastery. As at [[Tewkesbury Abbey]] after [[Battle of Tewkesbury|1471 battle]], Edward IV prepared to order his extraction and probable execution. The townspeople, however, took exception to the foreigner's behaviour and combined with the Francis' recovery, a small band of scouts rescued Henry.

==Rise to the throne==
[[File:Henryviiiarmour.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Perfected and fluted armour of Henry VII]]
By 1483, his mother, despite being married to a Yorkist ([[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]]), was actively promoting Henry as an alternative to [[Richard III of England|Richard III]].

At [[Rennes Cathedral]] on Christmas Day 1483, Henry pledged to marry Edward IV's eldest daughter, [[Elizabeth of York]], who was also Edward's heir since the presumed death of her brothers, the [[Princes in the Tower]] (King [[Edward V of England|Edward V]] and his brother [[Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York]]).<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'' (New Haven, Connecticut: Yale University Press, 1977) p. 65.</ref>  Henry then received the homage of his supporters.

With money and supplies borrowed from his host [[Francis II, Duke of Brittany]], Henry tried to land in England, but his conspiracy unravelled, resulting in the execution of his primary co-conspirator, the [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]].<ref name="Williams25">{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=25}}</ref> Now supported by Francis II's prime-minister [[Pierre Landais]], Richard III attempted to extradite Henry from Brittany, but Henry escaped to France.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kendall, Paul Murray |title=Richard the Third |page=297}}</ref> He was welcomed by the French, who readily supplied him with troops and equipment for a second invasion.

Having gained the support of the Woodvilles, in-laws of the late Edward IV, he sailed with a small French and Scottish force. Henry landed in Mill Bay, [[Pembrokeshire]], close to his birthplace. He marched towards England accompanied by his uncle Jasper and the [[John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford|Earl of Oxford]]. Wales was traditionally a Lancastrian stronghold, and Henry owed the support he gathered to his Welsh birth and ancestry, being directly descended, through his father, from [[Rhys ap Gruffydd]].<ref>Henry's return to Wales was regarded by some as the fulfilment of a Messianic prophecy. {{cite book |author=Rees, David |title=The Son of Prophecy: Henry Tudor's Road to Bosworth |publisher=Black Raven Press |location=London |year=1985  |isbn=0-85159-005-5}}</ref> He amassed an army of around 5,000 soldiers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kendall, Paul Murray |title=Richard the Third |page=361}}</ref><ref>Estimates of the size of Henry's army at Bosworth vary. {{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=31}}, gives a figure of 'perhaps' 6,000.</ref>

Henry was aware that his best chance to seize the throne was to engage Richard quickly and defeat him immediately, as Richard had reinforcements in [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]]. Richard only needed to avoid being killed to keep his throne. Though outnumbered, Henry's Lancastrian forces decisively defeated Richard's Yorkist army at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] on 22 August 1485. Several of Richard's key allies, such as the [[Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] and [[William Stanley (Battle of Bosworth)|William]] and [[Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby|Thomas]] Stanley, crucially switched sides or left the battlefield. Richard III's death at Bosworth Field effectively ended the Wars of the Roses, although it was not the last battle Henry had to fight.

==Reign==
[[File:Tudor Rose.svg|thumb|The [[Tudor Rose]]: a combination of the [[Red Rose of Lancaster]] and the [[White Rose of York]]]]
The first concern Henry had was to secure his hold on the throne. Henry's first action was to declare himself king "by right of conquest" retroactively from 21 August 1485, the day before Bosworth Field.<ref>S.. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 50.</ref> This meant that anyone who had fought for Richard against him would be guilty of [[Treason Act 1495|treason]]. Thus, Henry could legally confiscate the lands and property of Richard III while restoring his own. However, he spared Richard's nephew and designated heir, the [[John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln|Earl of Lincoln]]. He also created [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury|Margaret Plantagenet]], a Yorkist heiress, [[Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury|Countess of Salisbury]] sui juris.  He took great care not to address the baronage, or summon Parliament, until after his coronation, which took place in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 30 October 1485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/coronations/henry-vii-and-elizabeth-of-york|title=Westminster Abbey website: Coronations, Henry VII and Elizabeth of York|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref> Almost immediately afterwards, he issued an edict that any gentleman who swore fealty to him would, notwithstanding any previous attainder, be secure in his property and person.

He then honoured his pledge of December 1483 to marry Elizabeth of York.<ref name="Williams25"/><ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 53.</ref> They were third cousins, as both were great-great-grandchildren of John of Gaunt.<ref>Genealogical tables in {{cite book |author=Morgan, Kenneth O. |title=The Oxford History of Britain |page=709 }}</ref> The marriage took place on 18 January 1486 at [[Westminster Abbey|Westminster]]. The marriage unified the warring houses and gave his children a strong claim to the throne. The unification of the houses of York and Lancaster by this marriage is symbolised by the heraldic emblem of the [[Tudor rose]], a combination of the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster. It also ended future discussion as to whether the descendants of the fourth son of Edward III, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund, Duke of York]], through marriage to Philippa, heiress of the second son, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel, Duke of Clarence]], had a superior or inferior claim to those of the third son [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], who had held the throne for three generations.
In addition, Henry had [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] repeal ''[[Titulus Regius]]'', the statute that declared Edward IV's marriage invalid and his children illegitimate, thus legitimising his wife. Amateur historians [[Bertram Fields]] and [[Sir Clements Markham]] have claimed that he may have been involved in the murder of the Princes in the Tower, as the repeal of ''Titulus Regius'' gave the Princes a stronger claim to the throne than his own. [[Alison Weir]], however, points out that the Rennes ceremony, two years earlier, was possible only if Henry and his supporters were certain that the Princes were already dead.<ref>{{cite book |author=Weir, Alison |title=The Princes in the Tower |publisher=Ballantine |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-345-39178-0|page=190 }}</ref>

Henry secured his crown principally by dividing and undermining the power of the nobility, especially through the aggressive use of bonds and recognisances to secure loyalty. He also enacted laws against [[Bastard feudalism|livery and maintenance]], the great lords' practice of having large numbers of "retainers" who wore their lord's badge or uniform and formed a potential private army.

While he was still in Leicester, after the battle of Bosworth Field, Henry was already taking precautions to prevent any rebellions against his reign.  Before leaving Leicester to go to London, Henry dispatched [[Robert Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby de Broke|Robert Willoughby]] to Sheriff Hutton in Yorkshire, to have the ten-year-old [[Edward, Earl of Warwick]], arrested and taken to the Tower of London.<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 51.</ref> Edward was the son of George, Duke of Clarence, and as such he presented a threat as a potential rival to the new King Henry VII for the throne of England.  However, Henry was threatened by several active rebellions over the next few years. The first was the Rebellion of the [[Stafford and Lovell Rebellion|Stafford brothers]] and [[Francis Lovell, 1st Viscount Lovell|Viscount Lovell]] of 1486, which collapsed without fighting.<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 69.</ref>

In 1487, Yorkists led by Lincoln rebelled in support of [[Lambert Simnel]], a boy who was claimed to be the [[Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]],<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 72.</ref> son of Edward IV's brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Clarence]] (who had last been seen as a prisoner in the [[Tower of London|Tower]]). The rebellion began in  [[Ireland]], where  the traditionally [[Yorkist]] nobility, headed by the powerful  [[Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare]],  proclaimed Simnel King and provided troops for his invasion of England. The rebellion was defeated and Lincoln killed at the [[Battle of Stoke]]. Henry showed remarkable clemency to the surviving rebels: he pardoned Kildare  and the other  Irish nobles,  and he  made the boy, Simnel, a servant in the royal kitchen.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=62}}</ref>

In 1490, a young [[Flemish people|Fleming]], [[Perkin Warbeck]], appeared and claimed to be [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard]], the younger of the "Princes in the Tower". Warbeck won the support of Edward IV's sister [[Margaret of York|Margaret of Burgundy]]. He led attempted invasions of Ireland in 1491 and England in 1495, and persuaded [[James IV of Scotland]] to invade England in 1496. In 1497 Warbeck landed in [[Cornwall]] with a few thousand troops, but was soon captured and executed.<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', pp. 69–70.</ref>

In 1499, Henry had the Earl of Warwick executed. However, he spared Warwick's elder sister [[Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury|Margaret]]. She survived until 1541, when she was executed by Henry VIII.

Henry married Elizabeth of York with the hope of uniting the Yorkist and Lancastrian sides of the Plantagenet dynastic disputes. In this, he was largely successful. However, such a level of paranoia persisted that anyone (John de la Pole, Earl of Richmond,<ref>S. B. Chrimes, p. 72.</ref> is an example) with blood ties to the Plantagenets was suspected of coveting the throne.<ref>Penn 2011, pp. 22–23.</ref>

===Economics===
[[File:Henry VII groat.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Groat (coin)|Groat]] of Henry VII]]
For most of Henry VII's reign [[Edward Story]] was [[Bishop of Chichester]]. Story's register still exists and according to the 19th century historian W.R.W Stephens "affords some illustrations of the avaricious and parsimonious character of the king". It seems that the king was skillful at extracting money from his subjects on many pretexts including that of war with France or war with Scotland. The money so extracted added to the king's personal fortune rather than the stated purpose.<ref name=stephens176>Stephens. Memorials of the South Saxon See and Cathedral Church of Chichester. pp. 176-177</ref>

Unlike his predecessors, Henry VII came to the throne without personal experience in estate management or financial administration.<ref>S. B. Chimes, ''Henry VII'' (Yale University Press, 1977) p. 119.</ref> Yet during his reign Henry VII became a fiscally prudent monarch who restored the fortunes of an effectively bankrupt exchequer.  Henry VII introduced stability to the financial administration of England by keeping the same financial advisors throughout his reign.  For instance, excepting only the first few months of the reign, [[John Dynham, 1st Baron Dynham|Lord Dynham]] and [[Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk|Thomas Howard, earl of Surrey]] were the only two office holders in the position of [[Lord High Treasurer]] of England throughout the reign of Henry VII.<ref>S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 121</ref>

Henry VII improved tax collection within the realm by introducing ruthlessly efficient mechanisms of taxation. In this he was supported by his chancellor, Archbishop [[John Morton (archbishop)|John Morton]], whose "[[Morton's Fork]]" was a [[Catch-22 (logic)|catch-22]] method of ensuring that nobles paid increased taxes. Morton's Fork may actually have been invented by another of Henry's supporters—[[Richard Foxe]].<ref name="B. Chrimes, p. 203">S. B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', p. 203.</ref> However, whether it is called "Fox's Fork" or "Morton's Fork," the result was the same.  Those nobles who spent little must have saved much and, thus, they could afford the increased taxes.  On the other hand, those nobles who spent much obviously had the means to pay the increased taxes.<ref name="B. Chrimes, p. 203"/> Royal government was also reformed with the introduction of the [[King's Council]] that kept the nobility in check.

===Foreign policy===
Henry VII's policy was both to maintain peace and to create economic prosperity. Up to a point, he succeeded. He was not a military man and had no interest in trying to regain French territories lost during the reigns of his predecessors; he was therefore ready to conclude a treaty with France at Etaples that brought money into the coffers of England, and ensured the French would not support pretenders to the English throne, such as Perkin Warbeck. However, this treaty came at a slight price, as Henry mounted a minor invasion of Brittany in November 1492. Henry decided to keep Brittany out of French hands, signed an alliance with Spain to that end, and sent 7,000 troops to France. The confused, fractious nature of Breton politics undermined his efforts, which finally failed after three sizeable expeditions, at a cost of £24,000. However, as France was becoming more concerned with the Italian Wars, the French were happy to agree to the [[Treaty of Etaples]].<ref>John M. Currin, "'The King's Army into the Partes of Bretaigne': Henry VII and the Breton Wars, 1489–1491," ''War in History,'' Nov 2000, Vol. 7 Issue 4, p379-412</ref>
[[File:EmpsonHenryDudley.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Henry VII (centre), with his advisors [[Richard Empson|Sir Richard Empson]] and [[Edmund Dudley|Sir Edmund Dudley]]]]

Henry had been under the financial and physical protection of the French throne or its vassals for most of his life, prior to his ascending the throne of England. To strengthen his position, however, he subsidised shipbuilding, so strengthening the [[The Tudors and the Royal Navy|navy]] (he commissioned Europe's first ever – and the world's oldest surviving – [[dry dock]] at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] in 1495) and improving trading opportunities.

By the time of his death, he had amassed a personal fortune of [[£]]1.25&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite book |author=Weir, Alison |title=Henry VIII: King and Court |page=13 }}</ref>

Henry VII was one of the first European monarchs to recognise the importance of the newly united Spanish kingdom and concluded the [[Treaty of Medina del Campo (1489)|Treaty of Medina del Campo]], by which his son, [[Arthur Tudor]], was married to [[Catherine of Aragon]]. He also concluded the [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace]] with Scotland (the first treaty between England and Scotland for almost two centuries), which betrothed his daughter Margaret to King James IV of Scotland. By means of this marriage, Henry VII hoped to break the [[Auld Alliance]] between Scotland and France. Though this was not achieved during his reign, the marriage eventually led to the union of the English and Scottish crowns under Margaret's great-grandson, [[James I of England|James VI and I]] following the death of Henry's granddaughter [[Elizabeth I]].

He also formed an alliance with Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] (1493–1519) and persuaded [[Pope Innocent VIII]] to issue a [[papal bull]] of [[excommunication]] against all pretenders to Henry's throne.

===Trade agreements===
Henry's most successful diplomatic achievement as regards the economy was the ''[[Magnus Intercursus]]'' ("great agreement") of 1496. In 1494, Henry embargoed trade (mainly in wool) with the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Netherlands]] as retaliation for Margaret of Burgundy's support of Perkin Warbeck. The [[Company of Merchant Adventurers of London|Merchant Adventurers]], the company which enjoyed the monopoly of the Flemish wool trade, relocated from [[Antwerp]] to [[Calais]]. At the same time, Flemish merchants were ejected from England. The stand-off eventually paid off for Henry. Both parties realised they were mutually disadvantaged by the reduction in commerce. Its restoration by the ''Magnus Intercursus'' was very much to England's benefit in removing taxation for English merchants and significantly increasing England's wealth. In turn, Antwerp became an extremely important trade entrepot, through which, for example, goods from the Baltic, spices from the east and Italian silks were exchanged for English cloth.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |pages=167–168}}</ref>

In 1506, Henry extorted the Treaty of Windsor from [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome of Burgundy]]. Philip had been shipwrecked on the English coast, and while Henry's guest, was bullied into an agreement so favourable to England at the expense of the Netherlands that it was dubbed the ''Malus Intercursus'' ("evil agreement"). France, [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundy]], the Holy Roman Empire, Spain and the [[Hanseatic League]] all rejected the treaty, which was never in force. Philip died shortly after the negotiations.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |pages=198–201 }}</ref>

Henry VII was also enriched by trading [[alum]] which was used in the wool and cloth trades for dyeing fabric.<ref>Penn 2011, p. 201</ref> Since Europe had only one area where it was mined (Tolfa, Italy), it was a scarce commodity and therefore valuable. Starting in 1486, Henry VII became involved in the alum trade. With the assistance of the Italian merchant-banker, Lodovico della Fava and the Italian banker, Girolamo Frescobaldi, Henry VII became deeply involved in the alum trade by licensing ships, obtaining alum from the Ottoman Empire, and selling it to the Low Countries and England.<ref>Penn 2011, p. 203-204.</ref> This trade made an expensive commodity cheaper which raised opposition with [[Pope Julius II]] since the Tolfa, Italy alum mine was a part of papal territory thereby giving the Pope monopoly control over alum.

===Law enforcement and Justices of Peace===
Henry's principal problem was to restore royal authority in a realm recovering from the Wars of the Roses. There were too many powerful noblemen and, as a consequence of the system of so-called [[bastard feudalism]], each had what amounted to private armies of indentured retainers ([[mercenary|mercenaries]] masquerading as servants).
[[File:King Henry VII from NPG.jpg|thumb|left|Late 16th-century copy of a portrait of Henry VII]]

He was content to allow the nobles their regional influence if they were loyal to him. For instance, the Stanley family had control of Lancashire and Cheshire, upholding the peace on the condition that they stayed within the law. In other cases, he brought his over-powerful subjects to heel by decree. He passed laws against "livery" (the upper classes' flaunting of their adherents by giving them badges and emblems) and "maintenance" (the keeping of too many male "servants"). These laws were used shrewdly in levying fines upon those that he perceived as threats.

However, his principal weapon was the [[Court of Star Chamber]]. This revived an earlier practice of using a small (and trusted) group of the [[Privy Council]] as a personal or Prerogative Court, able to cut through the cumbersome legal system and act swiftly. Serious disputes involving the use of personal power, or threats to royal authority, were thus dealt with.<ref>{{cite book |author=Williams, Neville |title=The Life and Times of Henry VII |page=178 }}</ref>

Henry VII used [[Justices of the Peace]] on a large, nationwide scale. They were appointed for every shire and served for a year at a time. Their chief task was to see that the laws of the country were obeyed in their area. Their powers and numbers steadily increased during the time of the Tudors, never more so than under Henry's reign.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = MacCulloch | first = Diarmaid | year = 1996 |title = The Consolidation of England 1485–1603 | journal = The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain | pages=39–42 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref> Despite this, Henry was keen to constrain their power and influence, applying the same principles to the Justices of the Peace as he did to the nobility: a similar system of bonds and recognisances to that which applied to both the gentry and the nobles who tried to exert their elevated influence over these local officials.

All Acts of Parliament were overseen by the Justices of the Peace. For example, Justices of the Peace could replace suspect jurors in accordance with the 1495 act preventing the corruption of juries. They were also in charge of various administrative duties, such as the checking of weights and measures.

By 1509, Justices of the Peace were key enforcers of law and order for Henry VII. They were unpaid, which, in comparison with modern standards, meant a lesser tax bill to pay for a police force. Local gentry saw the office as one of local influence and prestige and were therefore willing to serve. Overall, this was a successful area of policy for Henry, both in terms of efficiency and as a method of reducing the corruption endemic within the nobility of the [[Middle Ages]].

===Later years and death===
[[File:HenryVIIdeathbed.jpg|thumb|Scene at deathbed of Henry VII at Richmond Palace, 1509. Drawn contemporaneously from witness accounts by the courtier Sir Thomas Wriothesley (d.1534), who wrote an account of the proceedings. BL Add.MS 45131,f.54]]

In 1502, Henry VII's first son and heir-apparent, [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]], died suddenly at [[Ludlow Castle]], very likely from a viral respiratory illness known, at the time, as the "[[English sweating sickness]]".<ref>Penn 2011, p. 70.</ref> This made Henry, Duke of York ([[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]) heir-apparent to the throne. The King, normally a reserved man who rarely showed much emotion in public unless angry,  surprised his courtiers by his intense grief and sobbing at his son's death, while his concern for the Queen is evidence that the marriage was a happy one, as is his reaction to the Queen's death the following year, when he shut himself away for several days, refusing to speak to anyone.<ref>Chrimes  ''Henry VII''  pp.302–4</ref>

Henry VII wanted to maintain the Spanish alliance. He therefore arranged a [[papal dispensation]] from [[Pope Julius II]] for Prince Henry to marry his brother's widow Catherine, a relationship that would have otherwise precluded marriage in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1503, Queen Elizabeth died in childbirth, so King Henry had the dispensation also permit him to marry Catherine himself. After obtaining the dispensation, Henry had second thoughts about the marriage of his son and Catherine. Catherine's mother [[Isabella I of Castile]] had died and Catherine's sister [[Joanna of Castile|Joanna]] had succeeded her; Catherine was therefore daughter of only one reigning monarch and so less desirable as a spouse for Henry VII's heir-apparent. The marriage did not take place during his lifetime. Otherwise, at the time of his father's arranging of the marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the future Henry VIII was too young to contract the marriage according to Canon Law, and would be ineligible until age fourteen.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Penn|first1=Thomas|title=Winter King: Henry VII and the Dawn of Tudor England|date=March 12, 2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1439191576|pages=204|edition=Reprint}}</ref>

Henry made half-hearted plans to remarry and beget more heirs, but these never came to anything. In 1505 he was sufficiently interested in a potential marriage to [[Joan of Naples (1478-1518)|Joan]], the recently widowed Queen of Naples, that he sent ambassadors to Naples to report on the 27-year-old's physical suitability.<ref>Schwarz, Arthur L., [http://www.amazon.com/dp/1605830178 ''VIVAT REX! An Exhibition Commemorating the 500th Anniversary of the Accession of Henry VIII''] (The Grolier Club, 2009), p. 58 "''Henry's Father Searches for a New Wife''".</ref> The wedding never took place, and curiously the physical description Henry sent with his ambassadors describing what he desired in a new wife matched the description of [[Elizabeth of York|Elizabeth]].  After 1503, records show the [[Tower of London]] was never again used as a royal residence by Henry Tudor, and all royal births under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] took place in palaces.  Henry VII was shattered by the loss of Elizabeth, and her death broke his heart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://authorherstorianparent.blogspot.com/2011/11/henry-viis-half-hearted-attempts-to-woo.html|title=his story, her story|author=Amy Licence|work=authorherstorianparent.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DBEPoST7-ooC&pg=PT52&lpg=PT52&dq=henry+vii+shattered+by+death&source=bl&ots=JuUI5CBqo-&sig=D9RmFZUPf3O4d5i96kD_Ehn3Izo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OEciVNrSLJSwyATWnIDgDQ&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=henry%20vii%20shattered%20by%20death&f=false|title=A Short History of Early Modern England|work=google.com}}</ref> During his lifetime he was often jeered  by the nobility for his re-centralizing of power in London, and later the 16th-century historian [[Francis Bacon]] was ruthlessly critical of the methods by which he enforced tax law, but equally true is the fact that Henry Tudor was hellbent on keeping detailed bookkeeping records of his personal finances, down to the last halfpenny;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/123%20202%20hvii%20policy.htm|title=Domestic and foreign policy of Henry VII|publisher=}}</ref> these and one account book detailing the expenses of his queen survive in the British National Archives.  Until the death of his wife Elizabeth, the evidence is crystal clear from these accounting books  that Henry Tudor was a more doting father and husband than was widely known.  Many of the entries in his account books show a man who loosened his purse strings generously for his wife and children, and not just on necessities: in spring 1491 he spent a great amount of gold on his daughter Mary for a lute; the following year he spent money on a lion for Queen Elizabeth's menagerie.

With the death of Elizabeth, the possibility for such family indulgences greatly diminished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queentohistory.com/book-reviews/documentaries/henry-vii-winter-king/|title=Henry VII Winter King|work=Queen to History}}</ref>  Immediately after Elizabeth's death, Henry became very sick and nearly died himself, and only allowed [[Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and Derby|Margaret Beaufort]], his mother, near him: "privily departed to a solitary place, and would that no man should resort unto him."<ref>Chrimes  ''Henry VII'' p.304</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Penn|first1=Thomas|title=Winter King: Henry VII and the Dawn of Tudor England|date=March 12, 2013|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1439191576|pages=110–113|edition=Reprint}}</ref>
[[File:Funeral effigy of Henry VII.jpg|thumb|left|The wooden funeral effigy used at Henry's funeral, still at [[Westminster Abbey]]]]
 
Henry VII died at [[Richmond Palace]] on 21 April 1509 of [[tuberculosis]] and was buried at [[Westminster Abbey]], next to his wife, Elizabeth, in the chapel he commissioned.<ref>S.B. Chrimes, ''Henry VII'', 313, 314 n5</ref> He was succeeded by his second son, [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (reign 1509–47). His mother survived him, dying two months later on 29 June 1509.

==Appearance and character==
Henry is the first English king for whose appearance we have good contemporary visual records in realistic portraits that are relatively free of idealization.  At twenty-seven, Henry was tall, slender, with small blue eyes, which were said to have a noticeable animation of expression,  and noticeably bad teeth in a long, sallow face beneath very fair hair. Amiable and high-spirited, Henry Tudor was friendly if dignified in manner, while it was clear to everyone that he was extremely intelligent. His biographer, Professor Chrimes, credits him – even before he had become king – with possessing "a high degree of personal magnetism, ability to inspire confidence, and a growing reputation for shrewd decisiveness". On the debit side, he may have looked a little delicate as he suffered from poor health.<ref>Chrimes, ''Henry VII'' p. 53</ref><ref>Desmond Seward, ''The Wars of the Roses'' pg 318</ref>

==Legacy and memory==
Historians have always compared Henry VII with his continental contemporaries, especially Louis XI of France and Ferdinand II of Aragon. By 1600 historians emphasised Henry's wisdom in drawing lessons in statecraft from other monarchs. By 1900 the [[New Monarchs|"New Monarchy"]] interpretation stressed the common factors that in each country led to the revival of monarchical power. This approach raised puzzling questions about similarities and differences in the development of national states. In the late 20th century a model of European state formation was prominent in which Henry less resembles Louis and Ferdinand.<ref>Steven Gunn, "Politic history, New Monarchy and state formation: Henry VII in European perspective," ''Historical Research,'' Aug 2009, Vol. 82 Issue 217, pp 380–392</ref>

==Henry's titles==
*'''Up to 1485''' The Earl of Richmond ''(disputed)''
*'''22 August 1485 – 21 April 1509:''' ''His Grace'' The King of England and France, Lord of Ireland

Henry's full style as king was: ''Henry, by the Grace of God, King of England, France and Lord of Ireland''

==Arms==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Henry VII of England (1485-1509).svg|thumb|upright|Coat of arms of King Henry VII]]
Upon his succession as king, Henry became entitled to bear the arms of his kingdom. After his marriage, he used the red-and-white rose as his emblem – this continued to be his dynasty's emblem, known as the [[Tudor rose]].

===Further descendants===
Henry VII's elder surviving daughter [[Margaret Tudor|Margaret]] was married first to [[James IV of Scotland]] (reigned 1488–1513). Their son became [[James V of Scotland]] (reigned 1513–42), whose daughter became [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (reigned 1542–67). Margaret Tudor's second marriage was to [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus|Archibald Douglas]]; their grandson, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] married [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Their son, [[James VI of Scotland]] (reigned 1567–1625), inherited the throne of England as [[James I of England|James I]] (reigned 1603–25) after the death of Henry's granddaughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] (reigned 1558–1603). After divorcing Douglas, her third and final marriage was to [[Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven|Henry Stewart]], with whom she had another daughter, Dorothea Stewart.

Henry VII's other surviving daughter, [[Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)|Mary]] first married King [[Louis XII of France]] (reigned 1498–1515), who died after only about three months of marriage. She then married the [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]] without the permission of her brother, now King Henry VIII. Their daughter Frances married [[Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Henry Grey]], and her children included [[Lady Jane Grey]], in whose name her parents and in-laws tried to seize the throne after [[Edward VI of England]] (reigned 1547–53) died.

The current monarch of the United Kingdom, [[Elizabeth II]], is a direct descendant of Henry VII. The daughter of Henry's double-great-great grandson James I/VI, [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Elizabeth Stuart]], was the mother of [[Sophia of Hanover]] whose descendants were the monarchs of the [[House of Hanover]] and the succeeding [[House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]]/[[House of Windsor|Windsor]].
