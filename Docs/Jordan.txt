==Etymology==
The kingdom is named after the [[Jordan River]], the origin of the river's name is argued but the most usual explanation is it is from Hebrew and other related [[Semitic languages]] word "yarad" meaning "the descender" ("Yarden" is the Hebrew name for the river). Another is that it is from the Arabic root word "wrd" meaning "to come to", as in people coming to a major source of water.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC|title=Mercer Dictionary of the Bible|accessdate=12 October 2015|year=1990|pages=467, 928|first1=Watson E.|last1= Mills|first2=Roger Aubrey|last2=Bullard|publisher=Mercer University Press}}</ref>

The name Jordan appears in an ancient Egyptian papyrus called [[Papyrus Anastasi I]], dating back to around 1000 BC.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Canaanite_toponyms_in_ancient_Egyptian_d.html?id=dGFtAAAAMAAJ|title=Canaanite toponyms in ancient Egyptian documents|accessdate=2016-03-19|year=1984|author=Shmuel Aḥituv|publisher=Magnes Press|page=123}}</ref> The lands consisting modern-day Jordan were historically called [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]], meaning beyond the Jordan River. During the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader rule]] of Jordan, it was called [[Oultrejordain]]. The name was Arabized into "[[Jund al-Urdunn|Al-Urdun]]" during the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]]. In 1921, the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] was established and after it gained its independence in 1946, it became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1949. "[[Hashemites|Hashemite]]" comes from the house name of the royal family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanzad.com/index.php?page=article&id=166171 |title=زاد الاردن الاخباري - أخبار الأردن &#124; اردن الشموخ والحضارة...اصل التسمية |language=Arabic|publisher=Jordanzad.com |date=2014-07-17 |accessdate=2016-03-12}}</ref>

The prehistoric period of Jordan ended by 2000 BC when the Semitic nomads known as the [[Amorites]] had entered the region. During the Bronze Age and Iron Age, present-day Jordan was home to several [[Ancient Near East|ancient kingdoms]], whose populations spoke [[Semitic languages]] of the [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite group]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Oxford_Handbook_of_the_Archaeology_o.html?id=U4_ylNNHBy4C|page=896|accessdate=2016-03-19|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Ritual and Religion|date=2011-10-27|first=Timothy|last=Insoll|publisher=Oxford University Presss}}</ref>[[File:Louvre 042010 01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Mesha Stele]] recorded the glory of [[Mesha]] the king of [[Moab]], around 1000 BC on display at the French [[Louvre]] museum.]] Among them were [[Ammon]], [[Edom]] and [[Moab]] which are described as tribal kingdoms rather than states.

These Transjordanian kingdoms were in continuous conflict with the neighboring Hebrew [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]], west of the Jordan River. Frequent confrontations ensued and tensions between them increased. This made the Assyrians reduce these kingdoms to vassals. However, when the region was later under the influence of the Babylonians, the Old Testament mentions that these kingdoms aided them in the 597 BC [[Siege of Jerusalem (597 BC)|sack of Jerusalem]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Survey_of_the_Old_Testament.html?id=WC80zxPIgyQC|title=A Survey of the Old Testament|first1=Andrew E.|last1=Hill|first2= John H.|last2=Walton|publisher=Harper Collins|accessdate=2016-03-20|date=2010-05-11|page=1964}}</ref> The [[Mesha Stele]] is a large black basalt stone that was erected in Moab and was inscribed by Moabite king [[Mesha]], in which he lauds himself for the building projects that he initiated in Moab and commemorates his glory and victory against the [[Israelites]].<ref>{{cite book|page=54|title=Writing and Literacy in the World of Ancient Israel: Epigraphic Evidence from the Iron Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kx9Uke_IfloC&pg=PA54|accessdate=2016-03-20|author=Chris A.

These kingdoms are believed to have continued to exist despite the fluctuations in the regional imperial rule and influence. They remained under rule of several powerful distant empires, including the [[Akkadian Empire]] (2335–2193 BC), [[Ancient Egypt]] (1500–1300 BC), [[Hittite Empire]] (1400–1300 BC), the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365–1020 BC), [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911–605 BC), the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (604–539 BC), [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539–332 BC) and the Hellenistic [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Empire of Macedonia]].<ref name="doa.gov.jo"/> However, by the time of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule in the Levant around 63 BC, the people of Ammon, Edom and Moab had lost their ancient identities and were assimilated into the Roman culture.<ref name="AEM"/>

===Classical period===
[[Alexander the Great]]'s [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquest]] of the Achaemenid Empire in 332 BC introduced Hellenistic culture to the Middle East.

After four centuries of stagnant Ottoman rule (1516–1918), Turkish control over Transjordan came to an end during [[World War I]] when the [[Hashemites|Hashemite]] [[Arab Army|Army]] of the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]], took over and secured present-day Jordan with the help and support of the region's local Bedouin tribes, [[Circassians]] and [[Jordanian Christians|Christians]].<ref name="Jordan in transition">{{cite book|pages=212, 308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRmR7vr9SboC&pg=PA212|title=Jordan in Transition|author=E.

The Great Arab Revolt was successful in gaining independence for most of the territories of the [[Hejaz]] and the Levant, including the region east of the [[Jordan River]]. However, it failed to gain international recognition of the region as an independent state, due mainly to the secret [[Sykes–Picot Agreement|Sykes–Picot Agreement of 1916]] and the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]]. This was seen by the Hashemites and the Arabs as a betrayal of their previous agreements with the British, including the [[McMahon–Hussein Correspondence]] of 1915, in which the British stated their willingness to recognize the independence of a unified Arab state stretching from [[Aleppo]] to [[Aden]] under the rule of the Hashemites. However, the region was divided and the four sons of Sharif Hussein received authority over four states. Sharif's son [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah]] established the [[Emirate of Transjordan]], which then became a British protectorate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/creating-chaos-lawrence-of-arabia-and-the-1916-arab-revolt.htm|title=Creating Chaos: Lawrence of Arabia and the 1916 Arab Revolt|accessdate=15 October 2015|date=10 August 2010|author=historynet.com|publisher=HistoryNet, LLC.}}</ref>

In September 1922, the Council of the [[League of Nations]] recognized Transjordan as a state under the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate for Palestine]] and the [[Transjordan memorandum]], and excluded the territories east of the Jordan River from the provisions of the mandate dealing with Jewish settlement.<ref>''League of Nations Official Journal'', Nov. 1922, pp. 1188–1189, 1390–1391.</ref> The Permanent Court of International Justice and an International Court of Arbitration established by the Council of the League of Nations handed down rulings in 1925 which determined that Palestine and Transjordan were newly created successor states of the [[Ottoman Empire]] whose sovereignty was in abeyance until such time as they would be recognised as independent of the Mandatory.

Multiple difficulties emerged upon the assumption of power in the region by the Hashemite leadership. In Transjordan, small local rebellions at [[Kura Rebellion|Kura]] in 1921 and 1923 were suppressed by [[Emir]] Abdullah with the help of British forces.<ref name=modernjordan104/> Repeated [[Ikhwan raids on Transjordan|Wahhabi incursions]] from Najd into the southern parts of his territory in 1924 were the most serious threats to Emir's position in Transjordan.<ref name=modernjordan104>{{cite book |author=Salibi, Kamal S. |accessdate=2016-03-20|title=The Modern History of Jordan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zdi2sCuIh8C&pg=PA104 |date=1998 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-331-6 |page=104}}</ref> The Emir was unable to repel those raids without the aid of the local Bedouin tribes and the British who maintained a military base, with a small [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] detachment close to [[Amman]].<ref name=modernjordan104/>

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Jordan}}

The kingdom has followed a pro-Western foreign policy and maintained close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. During the first [[Gulf War]], these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and maintaining relations with Iraq. Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process. After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rubincenter.org/2002/06/swaidan-and-nica-2002-06-07/|title=The 1991 Gulf War and Jordan’s Economy|accessdate=2016-03-20|date=2002-06-07|publisher=Rubin center research in international affairs|author1=Ziad Swaidan |author2=Mihai Nica }}</ref>

Jordan has been a [[medical tourism]] destination in the Middle East since the 1970s. A study conducted by [[Private Hospitals Association (Jordan)|Jordan's Private Hospitals Association]] found that 250,000 patients from 102 countries received treatment in Jordan in 2010, compared to 190,000 in 2007, bringing over $1 billion in revenue.

Jordan ranked as having the 35th best infrastructure in the world, one of the highest rankings in the developing world, according to the World Economic Forum's Index of Economic Competitiveness. This high infrastructural development is necessitated by its role as a transit country for goods and services to the [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Iraq]]. Palestinians use Jordan as a transit country due to the Israeli restrictions and the Iraqis use Jordan due to the instability in Iraq.<ref name="www3.weforum.org">{{cite web |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2010-11.pdf |title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2010–2011 |publisher=World Economic Forum |accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>

[[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islam]] is the dominant religion in Jordan.

Music in Jordan is now developing with a lot of new musicians and artists, who are now popular in the Middle East. These include singer and composer [[Toni Qattan]] and singer Hani Metwasi who changed the perception of the music of Jordan which was unpopular for many years. There is also an increasing growth of alternative Arabic music bands, who are dominating the scene in the [[Arab World]] such as [[El Morabba3]], [[Autostrad (band)|Autostrad]], [[JadaL]], [[Akher Zapheer]] and Ayloul.

However, other uncommon sports are also gaining popularity. [[Rugby football|Rugby]] is on the rise in Jordan and hundreds of people are playing and watching it. Youngsters established a Rugby Union, which was then recognized by the Jordan Olympic Committee, that now supervises over three national teams.

A common appetizer is [[hummus]], which is a puree of [[chick peas]] blended with [[tahini]], lemon, and garlic. [[Ful Medames]] is another well-known appetiser. A typical worker's meal, it has since made its way to the tables of the upper class.

The most distinctive Jordanian dish is [[mansaf]], the national dish of Jordan. The dish is a symbol for Jordanian hospitality and is influenced by the Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used.<ref name="Mansaf"/> Simple fresh [[fruit]] is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, there is also dessert, such as [[baklava]], hareeseh, [[knafeh]], [[halva]] and [[qatayef]], a dish made specially for [[Ramadan]]. In Jordanian cuisine, drinking [[coffee]] and [[tea]] flavored with [[Mentha|na'na]] or [[Salvia officinalis|meramiyyeh]] is almost a ritual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waleg.com/kitchen/archives/000912.html|title=Jordan National Dish, Mansaf|publisher=|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>
