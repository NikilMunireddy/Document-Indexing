{{2011 Pan American Games}}
The '''2011 [[Pan American Games]]''', officially the '''XVI Pan American Games''', was an international [[multi-sport event]] that was held from October 14–30, 2011, in [[Guadalajara]], [[Jalisco]], Mexico. Some events were held in the nearby cities of [[Ciudad Guzmán]], [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Lagos de Moreno]] and [[Tapalpa]]. It was the largest [[multi-sport event]] of 2011,<ref name="aroundtherings">{{cite news |title=Tuesday Talk -- Guadalajara 2011 Chiefs on Pan Am Construction Progress, Safety Concerns|author= Matthew Grayson|url=http://aroundtherings.com/site/A__36781/Title__Tuesday-Talk----Guadalajara-2011-Chiefs-on-Pan-Am-Construction-Progress-Safety-Concerns/292/Articles |newspaper=[[Around the Rings]] |date=April 12, 2011 |accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref> with approximately 6,000 athletes from 42 nations participating in 36 sports. Both the Pan American and [[2011 Parapan American Games|Parapan American Games]] were organized by the Guadalajara 2011 Organizing Committee (COPAG). The 2011 Pan American Games were the third Pan American Games hosted by Mexico (the first country to do so) and the first held in the state of [[Jalisco]].

The [[2011 Parapan American Games]] were held 20 days after the Pan American Games have ended.

Following [[Pan American Sports Organization|PASO]] tradition, Jalisco governor [[Emilio González Márquez]] and then Guadalajara mayor [[Alfonso Petersen Farah]] received the [[Pan American Sports Organization#Flag|Pan American Sports Organization flag]] during the closing ceremony of the [[2007 Pan American Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guadalajara2011.org.mx/ENG/09_Multimedia/noticias_view.asp?id_noticia=119 |title=The Governor of Jalisco and the Mayor of Guadalajara accept the responsibility for Guadalajara 2011. |author= COPAG|date=July 29, 2007 |work=Guadalajara 2011 Organizing Committee |publisher= |accessdate=June 2, 2011}}</ref> The event was officially opened by the [[President of Mexico]] [[Felipe Calderón]].

[[Pan American Sports Organization|PASO]] selected the city unanimously as the host for 16th Pan American Games on Friday, June 2, 2006, at its 44th general assembly held in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].<ref name="AIPS">{{cite news|url=http://www.aipsmedia.com/index.php?page=news&cod=309&tp=n|title=Guadalajara will host the XVI Pan American Games in 2011|date=|work=International Sports Press Association|agency=|accessdate=June 1, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110707101033/http://www.aipsmedia.com/index.php?page=news&cod=309&tp=n| archivedate= 7 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Guadalajara was the only city to officially bid for the 2011 Pan American Games.

===Infrastructure and budget===
Inspired by the [[2003 Pan American Games|2003 Santo Domingo Games]], Guadalajara used the Games as a cost-effective{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} way to build sports infrastructure, according to [[Ivar Sisniega]], Guadalajara 2011 international relations and sports director.  Guadalajara, a metropolitan area of five million people, is a destination for cultural and business travellers.<ref name="Banderas News 2008">{{cite news|title=Guadalajara Has What Toronto Lacks|author= Bill Lankhof|url=http://www.banderasnews.com/0805/nw-panamgames.htm|newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]]|date=May 8, 2008|accessdate=May 5, 2011}}</ref>

Horacio de la Vega, marketing director for Guadalajara 2011, cited the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]] as the inspiration for infrastructure improvements. "Barcelona wasn't Barcelona before it got the Olympic Games. In a more modest sense, we are doing the same in Guadalajara", he said.<ref name="Banderas News 2008" /> The budget was estimated at US $200 million, of which $180 million was for sports infrastructure. Some of the funding went to general street improvement and public transportation. Dr. Carlos Andrade was the head of the organizing committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guadalajara2011.org.mx/eng/10_copag/estructura.asp |title=MStructure of the Organizing Committee |date=June 22, 2009 |work= |agency= |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110707225814/http://www.guadalajara2011.org.mx:80/eng/10_copag/estructura.asp |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}</ref>

However, as the Games drew closer to starting, it was revealed that the costs of building the venues and the athletes' village had more than tripled to US$750 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.com.py/nota/esperan-que-juegos-panamericanos-2011-sean-los-mejores/|title=Esperan que Juegos Panamericanos 2011 sean los mejores|date=February 10, 2011|work=|agency=|accessdate=June 13, 2011|language=es}}</ref>

The city planned to build a new [[convention center]] and undertake road improvements. Additional plans called for transit improvements, a performing arts theater ([[Auditorio Telmex]]) and a new public library.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Pan American Games are Coming to Guadalajara in 2011!|author=|url=http://www.focusonmexico.com/Pan-American-Games-2011.html|newspaper=Focus on Mexico|date=January 1, 2011|accessdate=May 22, 2011}}</ref> Guadalajara increased the number of available hotel rooms by 5,000 for the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thevoiceslu.com/sports/2011/july/09_07_11/100_DAY_COUNTDOWN.htm|title=100-DAY COUNTDOWN TO GUADALAJARA|date=July 9, 2011|accessdate=August 16, 2011|publisher=www.thevoiceslu.com}}</ref>

By April, Guadalajara 2011 had made over US$50 million revenue from television rights and sponsors, which was more than the [[2007 Pan American Games|previous games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The organizing committee had aimed for a revenue of about $70 million by the end of the Games. The organizing committee also expected to sell about one million tickets, which went on sale on May 13, 2011.<ref name="aroundtherings"/>

In June 2011, four months before the games, Carlos Andrade stated that no construction concerns remained for Guadalajara. He said that all 23 stadiums being built would be ready for the start of the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=37293|title=European Games Progress; ANOCA Assembly; Pan Ams Update|date=June 27, 2011|accessdate=June 29, 2011|publisher=Around the Rings}}</ref>

===Marketing===

Marketing for the games began in 2007 at the closing ceremony of the [[2007 Pan American Games]] in Rio de Janeiro with a handover ceremony to the next host city. The state and national governments arranged for signs and billboards. Two TV networks, [[Televisa]] and [[TV Azteca]], signed contracts to broadcast the Games and to advertise them.<ref name="aroundtherings"/> Famous athletes from Mexico, including [[diving|diver]] [[Fernando Platas]] and [[golf]]er [[Lorena Ochoa]], were also named ambassadors to promote the games.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://travelbymexico.com/blog/8042-belanova-lorena-ochoa-fernando-platas-embajadores-panamericanos-2011/|title= Belanova, Lorena Ochoa, Fernando Platas, Embajadores Panamericanos 2011|author= Travel by Mexico|date=June 12, 2011 |work=|publisher= |accessdate=June 12, 2011|language=es}}</ref> The organizing committee also signed a marketing deal with [[SKY México]], which operates in several countries.

There were four official sponsors for the Games: [[Scotiabank]], [[Telcel]], [[Nissan Motors|Nissan]] and [[Telmex]]. Accordingly, some of the venues were named after these sponsors, such as the Scotiabank Aquatics Center, Nissan Gymnastics Stadium, Telcel Tennis Complex and the Telmex Athletics Stadium. [[Children International]] was also an official benefactor of the Pan American Games. "Second tier" and "third tier" sponsors included [[Technogym]] and others.<ref name="aroundtherings"/>

==Concerns and controversies==

===Security===
Guadalajara, due to the ongoing [[Mexican Drug War]], has seen escalating violence. Some countries, including the United States and Canada, expressed concerns about the safety and security of the region.<ref name="drugwar">{{Cite web |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/16/us-olympics-usoc-panams-idUSTRE72F0ET20110316|title=USOC concerned about drug war ahead of Pan Am Games|author=Steve Keating|date=March 16, 2011|publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate= June 13, 2011}}</ref> Scott Backmun of the [[United States Olympic Committee]] (USOC) raised concerns about the city's ability to host the games in light of the drug war.<ref name="drugwar"/> Due to the increased safety issues the USOC had its own security plan for the games. During a meeting of the USOC in March 2011, chief security officer [[Larry Buendorf]] gave a report to the rest of the committee in which he said, "We’re going to prepare for Guadalajara like we would any other Games. A lot of that is just preparing your athletes for the individual environments that they’re going into. Everybody is quite aware of the violence that has happened. We’re obviously concerned about it, and at the end of the day, I think we have a good security plan in place to try to protect our athletes".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gazetteolympics.freedomblogging.com/2011/03/15/usoc-discusses-pan-am-games-security-japan-relief-efforts-at-board-meeting/4161/|title=USOC discusses Pan Am Games security, Japan relief efforts at board meeting |author=|date=March 15, 2011|publisher=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] |accessdate= May 5, 2011}}</ref> After grenades were thrown near a nightclub entrance in two separate incidents in February 2011, organizers said they were making security a priority and arranged for police and members of the armed forces to patrol in Guadalajara throughout the games.<ref name="venuedelays">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/more/wires/06/24/2080.ap.pan.american.games.delays.1st.ld.writethru.1042/ |title=Pan American Games scramble to finish venues |work=Sports Illustrated |date=June 24, 2011 |accessdate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20121104115340/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/more/wires/06/24/2080.ap.pan.american.games.delays.1st.ld.writethru.1042/ |archivedate=November 4, 2012 }}</ref>

===Athletes' village===
[[File:Pan american village.jpg|thumb|Right|250px|right|The Pan American Games village during the games.]]
The athletes' village was behind schedule for the entire time it was under construction, and in May 2011, about five months before the start of the games, the courts ordered work on the village to halt when residents of [[Zapopan]] said the construction would adversely affect their drinking water supply.  Carlos Andrade Garin, the director of the organizing committee, said even a short delay in construction would mean the games would have to be canceled.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2011-05-02-987698277_x.htm|title=Judge orders work stopped on athletes' village |author=|date=May 3, 2011|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate= March 4, 2014}}</ref>

According to Garin, "we have some crabs [people who don't want to go forward] who don't like our state to grow, who don't like us having a great event, whose own related interests are more important than those of the community. Unfortunately, you can't do anything against this kind of people, except get on with our own job."<ref name="athletesvillage">{{Cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=6480594|title=Athletes' village construction continues|author=|date=May 4, 2011|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate= May 5, 2011}}</ref>

After many delays, organizers finally asserted that the athletes' village would be finished no later than September, only a month before the games were to begin.<ref name="venuedelay">{{Cite web|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/deportes/2011/04/11/sedes-para-los-juegos-panamericanos-2011-estaran-concluidas-en-septiembre|title=Sedes para los Juegos Panamericanos 2011 estarán concluidas en septiembre|author=|date=April 11, 2011|publisher=[[CNN|CNN Mexico]]|accessdate= June 14, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110714033202/http://mexico.cnn.com/deportes/2011/04/11/sedes-para-los-juegos-panamericanos-2011-estaran-concluidas-en-septiembre| archivedate= 14 July 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no|language=es}}</ref> The village was expected to be handed over to COPAG by August 22, 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guadalajara2011.org.mx/ENG/09_Multimedia/noticias_view.asp?id_noticia=4419|title=Pan American Village Passed Over to COPAG|author=|date=August 10, 2011|work=COPAG|accessdate= August 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Venue delays===
Another concern with the Games was that venue construction had fallen behind. In 2009, two years before the start of the games, the athletes' village was still not under construction and the aquatics and athletics stadiums fell way behind schedule.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=33629|title=On the Scene -- Scramble to Solve Pan Am Games Crisis |author=|date= November 3, 2009|publisher=[[Around the Rings]] |accessdate= April 28, 2011}}</ref> Some venues and the athletes village were finished only a few weeks before the start of the games, including the Telcel Athletics Stadium and the beach volleyball stadium in [[Puerto Vallarta]]. This meant that not all disciplines could have a test event before the games began.<ref name="aroundtherings"/> Organizers guaranteed that all the sports venues being built for the games would be ready before September 2011.<ref name="venuedelay"/> Many of the venues were scaled down, including the Telmex athletics stadium, which had the number of seats halved.<ref name="venuedelays"/> During the election of the host city of the [[2015 Pan American Games]], [[Pan American Sports Organization|PASO]] president [[Mario Vázquez Rana]] said that if Guadalajara did not address the delays, [[Toronto]], the host of the next games, would step in and replace Guadalajara as host.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://espndeportes.espn.go.com/news/story?id=926438&s=otr&type=story|title=La disputa panamericana|author=|date= November 5, 2009|publisher= ESPN Deportes |accessdate= July 29, 2011|language=es}}</ref> In August 2011, the athletics stadium was further delayed by constant rain which prevented the installation of the track. This development put the test event scheduled for September at risk of being cancelled.<ref name="delay"/> Several days before the opening ceremony, the organizing committee announced that they were optimistic that the venues would be ready by the start of the games.<ref>{{cite news |title=Preparations for Guadalajara Pan American Games completed just in time|author= Tom Degun|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/latest/14514-preparations-for-guadalajara-pan-american-games-completed-just-in-time |newspaper=insidethegames.biz |date=October 10, 2011 |accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

===Allegation of tainted meat===
The German National Anti-Doping Agency warned athletes that some meat in Mexico had tested positive for the stimulant [[clenbuterol]]. However, Games officials said that food served at the athletes' village would be tested to ensure it contained no drugs or contaminants.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2011-04-14-4104396733_x.htm|title=No clenbuterol doping risk at Pan American Games|author=|date= April 14, 2011|work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate= June 12, 2011}}</ref>
