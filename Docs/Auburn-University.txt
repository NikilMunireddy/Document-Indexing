==History==
{{main|History of Auburn University}}
[[File:1883 Old Main Building South College Street Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|"Old Main", the first building on Auburn's campus, was destroyed by [[fire]] in 1887]]

Auburn University was chartered by the Alabama Legislature as the East Alabama Male College on February 1, 1856, coming under the guidance of the [[Methodist Church]] in 1859.<ref>Anson West, ''History of Methodism in Alabama'' (Nashville: Methodist Episcopal Church South, 1893), 738–739.</ref> The first president of the institution was Reverend [[William J. Sasnett]], and the school opened its doors in 1859 to a student body of eighty and a faculty of ten. The early history of Auburn is inextricably linked with the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era South. Classes were held in "Old Main" until the college was closed due to the Civil War, when most of the students and faculty left to enlist. The campus was used as a training ground for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, and "Old Main" served as a hospital for Confederate wounded.

To commemorate Auburn's contribution to the Civil War, a cannon lathe used for the manufacture of cannons for the Confederate Army and recovered from [[Selma, Alabama]], was presented to Auburn in 1952 by brothers of Delta Chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://secure.flickr.com/photos/codelemur/5108012123/in/set-72157625100858387|title= The Cannon Lathe plaque|accessdate = 2011-01-17}}</ref> It sits today on the lawn next to [[Samford Hall]].

===Post-Civil War===
The school was reopened in 1866 following the end of the Civil War and has been open ever since. In 1872, control of the institution was transferred from the Methodist Church to the State of [[Alabama]] for financial reasons. Alabama placed the school under the provisions of the [[Morrill Act]] as a [[Land-grant colleges|land-grant institution]], the first in the South to be established separate from the state university. This act provided for 240,000 acres (971&nbsp;km²) of Federal land to be sold in order to provide funds for an agricultural and mechanical school. As a result, in 1872 the school was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama.

Under the provisions of this act, land-grant institutions were also supposed to teach military tactics and train officers for the United States military. In the late 19th century, most students at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama were enrolled in the cadet program, learning military tactics and training to become future officers. Each county in the state was allowed to nominate two cadets to attend the college free of charge.

[[File:1890s Samford Hall Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Samford Hall]] in the 1890s]]
In 1892, two historic events occurred: women were first admitted to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and football was first played as a school sport. Eventually, football replaced polo as the main sport on campus. In 1899, the school name was again changed, this time to Alabama Polytechnic Institute.

[[File:Auburn cadets.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|API [[Cadet]]s drill on Ross Square in 1918.]]
On October 1, 1918, nearly all of Alabama Polytechnic Institute's able-bodied male students 18 or older voluntarily joined the [[United States Army]] for short-lived military careers on campus. The student-soldiers numbered 878, according to API President Charles Thach, and formed the academic section of the Student Army Training Corps. The vocational section was composed of enlisted men sent to Auburn for training in radio and mechanics. The students received honorable discharges two months later following the Armistice that ended [[World War I]]. API struggled through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], having scrapped an extensive expansion program by then-President [[Bradford Knapp]]. Faculty salaries were cut drastically, and enrollment decreased along with State appropriations to the college. By the end of the 1930s, Auburn had essentially recovered, but then faced new conditions caused by [[World War II]].

As war approached in 1940, there was a great shortage of engineers and scientists needed for the defense industries. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Office of Education]] asked all American engineering schools to join in a "crash" program to produce what was often called "instant engineers." API became an early participant in an activity that eventually became [[Engineering, Science, and Management War Training]] (ESMWT). Fully funded by the government and coordinated by Auburn's Dean of Engineering, college-level courses were given in concentrated, mainly evening classes at sites across Alabama. Taken by thousands of adults – including many women – these courses were highly beneficial in filling the wartime ranks of civilian engineers, chemists, and other technical professionals. The ESMWT also benefited API by providing employment for faculty members when the student body was significantly diminished by [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] and patriotic volunteers.

During the war, API also trained U.S. military personnel on campus; between 1941 and 1945, Auburn produced over 32,000 troops for the war effort. Following the end of World War II, API, like many colleges around the country, experienced a period of massive growth caused by returning military personnel taking advantage of their [[GI Bill]] offer of free education. In the five-year period following the end of the war, enrollment at API more than doubled.

===Name change to Auburn===
Recognizing the school had moved beyond its agricultural and mechanical roots, it was granted university status by the Alabama Legislature in 1960 and officially renamed Auburn University, a name that better expressed the varied academic programs and expanded curriculum that the school had been offering for years. However, it had been popularly called "Auburn" for many years even before the official name change.

Auburn University was [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] prior to 1963, with only white students being admitted. Integration began in 1964 with the admittance of the first African-American student, Harold A. Franklin.<ref name="HaroldFranklin">{{cite web |url=http://www.theplainsman.com/view/full_story/24426097/article-Auburn-commemorates-50-years-of-integration-with-public-forum- |title=Auburn commemorates 50 years of integration with public forum |last=Price |first=Juan |date=2014-01-21 |publisher=The Plainsman}}</ref> The first degree granted to an African-American was in 1967.<ref name="HaroldFranklin"/> According to Auburn University's Office of Institutional Research and Assessment, African-Americans comprise 1,828 of the university's 24,864 undergraduates (7.35%) as of 2013 and 49 of the 1,192 full-time faculty (4.1%) as of 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/enrtrends/eebg.aspx |title=Total Enrollment by Gender and Ethnicity |publisher=Auburn University Office of Institutional Research and Assessment |date=2013-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/facandstaff/ftebtare.aspx |title=Full-Time Employees by Type and Race & Ethnicity |publisher=Auburn University Office of Institutional Research and Assessment |date=2012-12-19}}</ref> AU has decreased its African American faculty percentage from 4.3% in 2003 to 4.1% today, since the settlement of legal challenges to the underrepresentation of African Americans in AU's faculty in 2006.<ref>http://knightsims.com/pdf/05_03_23/AU%20Contempt%20motion.pdf</ref>

Today, Auburn has grown since its founding to have an on-campus enrollment of over 25,000 students and a faculty of almost 1,200 at the main campus in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]].<ref>Auburn University's OIRA Report for 2009, Spring Semester</ref> There are also more than 6,000 students at the [[Auburn University at Montgomery]] satellite campus established in 1967.

Auburn is a charter member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC), currently composed of 13 of the largest Southern public universities in the US and one private university, [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]]. Among the other 12 peer public universities, Auburn is ranked fourth in the 2011 edition of ''U.S. News & World Report''.<ref>[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-top-public "Top Public Schools: National Universities".

The university currently consists of thirteen schools and colleges. Programs in architecture, pharmacy, veterinary science, engineering, forestry, and business have been ranked among the best in the country.

The journal ''DesignIntelligence'' in its 2013 edition of "America's Best Architecture and Design Schools" ranked Auburn's undergraduate Architecture program No. 9 and Industrial Design program No. 6 nationally. In addition, Auburn's graduate Landscape Architecture program was ranked No. 13 nationally and Industrial Design program 4th.

The undergraduate Interior Design program in the College of Human Sciences is ranked No. 1 nationally by DesignIntelligence magazine. For its annual survey, "America's Best Architecture & Design Schools," the publication asked 277 leading architecture and design firms which schools best prepare students for success in the profession. Based on Interior Design programs accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA), Auburn was ranked No. 1 in the nation, along with Savannah College of Art and Design.

Auburn's  College of Architecture pioneered the nation's first interior architecture degree program; its dual degree Architecture & Interior Architecture degree was the first in the nation. Its College of Architecture, Design, and Construction pioneered the nation's first Design Build master's degree program, capitalizing on the College's  Building Science  program with Auburn's "Rural Studio" program where Architectural students build highly creative and ingenious homes for some of the poorest regions of Alabama. These homes and efforts have been publicized by People Magazine, Time, featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, numerous Architectural and Construction periodicals as well. Of special mention is the School's [[Rural Studio]] program, founded by the late [[Samuel Mockbee]].

The Samuel Ginn College of Engineering has a 134-year tradition of engineering education, consistently ranking in the nation's largest 20 engineering programs in terms of numbers of engineers graduating annually. The college has a combined enrollment of close to 4,000. Auburn's College of Engineering offers majors in civil, mechanical, electrical, industrial and systems engineering, polymer and fiber engineering, aerospace, agricultural, bio-systems, materials, chemical engineering, computer science, and software engineering, and—more recently—began a program in [[wireless engineering]] after receiving a donation from alumnus [[Samuel L. Ginn]]. In 2001, Ginn, a noted US pioneer in wireless communication, made a $25 million gift to the college and announced plans to spearhead an additional $150 million in support. This gave Auburn the first Bachelor of Wireless Engineering degree program in the United States. Auburn University was the first university in the Southeast to offer the bachelor of software engineering degree and the master of software engineering degree.

Auburn has historically placed much of its emphasis on the education of engineers at the undergraduate level, and in recent years has been ranked as high as the 10th largest undergraduate engineering program in the US in terms of the number of undergraduate degrees awarded on annual basis. The Ginn College of Engineering is now focused on expanding the graduate programs, and was recently ranked 60th nationally  university with doctoral programs in engineering by ''U.S. News & World Report''. Last year, the College ranked 67th among all engineering programs . "America's Best Graduate Schools 2006" ranks the Ginn College of Engineering's graduate program in the Top 100 graduate engineering programs in the US. Auburn's Industrial and Systems Engineering, Civil Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering were all ranked in the top 100.

Auburn's Economics Department (formerly in the College of Business, now in the College of Liberal Arts) was ranked 123rd in the world in 1999 by the ''Journal of Applied Econometrics''. Auburn was rated ahead of such international powerhouses as INSEAD in France (141st) and the London Business School (146th). Auburn's MBA Program in the College of Business has annually been ranked by ''U.S. News & World Report magazine'' in the top ten percent of the nation's more than 750 MBA Programs. The [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] offices were once located in the business department of Auburn University, and the LvMI continues to work with the university on many levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3467#part |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Mises.org – Mises Institute |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref>

Nationally recognized ROTC programs are available in three branches of service: Air Force, Army, and Navy/Marine Corps, the latter being the only one in Alabama. Each of these units is ranked among the top ten in the nation. Over 100 officers that attended Auburn have reached flag rank (general or admiral), including one, [[Carl Epting Mundy Jr.]], who served as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant of the US Marine Corps]]. Auburn is one of only seven universities in the Nuclear Enlisted Commissioning Program, and has historically been one of the top ROTC producers of Navy nuclear submarine officers.

In addition to the many outstanding ROTC graduates commissioned through Auburn, two master's degree alumni from Auburn, four-star generals [[Hugh Shelton]] and [[Richard Myers]], served as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in the last decade. Both officers received their commissions elsewhere, and attended Auburn for an M.S. (Shelton) and M.B.A. (Myers).

Auburn has graduated six astronauts (including [[Ken Mattingly|T.K. Mattingly]] of [[Apollo 13]] fame) and one current and one former director of the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. 1972 Auburn Mechanical Engineering graduate Jim Kennedy, currently director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, was previously deputy director of [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC). Several hundred Auburn graduates, primarily engineers and scientists, currently work directly for NASA or NASA contractors. Hundreds of Auburn engineers worked for NASA at MSFC during the peak years of the "space race" in the 1960s, when the Saturn and Apollo moon programs were in full development.

The [[Old Rotation]] on campus is the oldest continuous agricultural experiment in the Southeast, and third oldest in the United States, dating from 1896. In addition, the work of Dr. David Bransby on the use of [[switchgrass]] as a [[biofuel]] was the source of its mention in the [[2006 State of the Union Address]].

The university recently began a [[Graduate real estate education|Master of Real Estate Development]] program.,<ref>[http://www.cadc.auburn.edu/aumred/program.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}</ref> one of the few in the Southeast. The program has filled a void of professional real estate education in Alabama.

''Modern Healthcare'' ranked Auburn University's Physicians Executive M.B.A. (PEMBA) program in the College of Business ninth in the nation among all degree programs for physician executives, according to the Journal's May 2006 issue. Among M.B.A. programs tailored specifically for physicians, AU's program is ranked second.

==Campus arrangement==
[[File:William J. Samford Hall.jpg|thumb|right|Samford Hall at dusk]]

The Auburn campus is primarily arranged in a grid-like pattern with several distinct building groups. The northern section of the central campus (bounded by Magnolia Ave. and Thach Ave.) contains most of the College of Engineering buildings, the Lowder business building, and the older administration buildings. The middle section of the central campus (bounded by Thach Ave. and Roosevelt Dr.) contains the College of Liberal Arts (except fine arts) and the College of Education, mostly within Haley Center. The southern section of the central campus (bounded by Roosevelt Dr. and Samford Ave.) contains the most of the buildings related to the College of Science and Mathematics, as well as fine arts buildings.

Several erratic building spurts, beginning in the 1950s, have resulted in some exceptions to the subject clusters as described above. Growing interaction issues between pedestrians and vehicles led to the closure of a significant portion of Thach Avenue to vehicular traffic in 2004. A similarly sized portion of Roosevelt Drive was also closed to vehicles in 2005. In an effort to make a more appealing walkway, these two sections have been converted from asphalt to concrete. The general movement towards a pedestrian only campus is ongoing, but is often limited by the requirements for emergency and maintenance vehicular access.

[[File:Ralph Brown Draughon Library - Auburn University - IMG 2806.JPG|thumb|left|Auburn's main central library, the Ralph Brown Draughon Library]]

The current period of ongoing construction began around the year 2000. All recently constructed buildings have used a more traditional architectural style that is similar to the style of Samford Hall, Mary Martin Hall, and the Quad dorms. The Science Center complex was completed in 2005. This complex contains chemistry labs, traditional classrooms, and a large lecture hall. A new medical clinic opened behind the Hill dorm area. Taking the place of the old medical clinic and a few other older buildings, is the Shelby Center for Engineering Technology. Phase I of the Shelby Center opened in the Spring of 2008, with regular classes being held starting with the Summer 2008 term. A new Student Center opened in 2008.

===Housing===
Auburn's initial Campus Master plan was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.]] in 1929.<ref>{{cite web |title=Director's Corner: Nature and the Environmental Movement: Human Values in Action |url=http://wp.auburn.edu/sustainability/dc_nature/ |date=April 20, 2014 |first=Mike |last=Kensler |publisher=Auburn University Office of Sustainability}}</ref> For most of the early history of Auburn, boarding houses and barracks made up most of the student housing. Even into the 1970s, boarding houses were still available in the community. It wasn't until the [[Great Depression]] that Auburn began to construct the first buildings on campus that were residence halls in the modern sense. As the university gradually shifted away from agricultural and military instruction to more of an academic institution, more and more dorms began to replace the barracks and boarding houses.

In the 1980s, the City of Auburn began to experience rapid growth in the number of apartment complexes constructed. Most Auburn students today live off-campus in the apartment complexes and condos, which surround the immediate area around the university. Only 19 percent of all undergraduate students at Auburn live on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1608&profileId=8 |title=College Search |publisher=Auburn University – Housing & Campus Life |date= |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref>

Auburn's on-campus student housing consists of four complexes located at various locations over campus – The Quad, The Hill, The Village, and South Donahue.
* The Quad is the oldest of the four housing complexes, dating to the Great Depression projects begun by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and located in Central Campus. Comprising ten buildings split into the Upper and Lower Quads, the Quad houses undergraduate students. Eight of the buildings are coed by floor, the remaining two are female-only. The Upper Quad comprises four Honors College dorms.
* The Hill consists of 12 buildings and is located in South Campus. The Hill houses mostly undergraduates. There are two high-rise, 6-story dormitories (Boyd and Sasnett), and all dorms are coed (but have gender-separated floors) with the exception of Leischuck and Hall M, which are female only. All of the Hill dormitories were previously used to house sororities until 2009. The sororities are now housed in the newer Village complex.
* The Village was constructed in 2009 and includes eight 4-story buildings to accommodate 1,700 residents. This complex houses undergraduates and sororities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/front/board_approves_tuition_increase_new_residence_halls|title=Board approves tuition increase, new residence halls|work=The Auburn Plainsman|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref>
* South Donahue opened in 2013 and is a single residence hall located on the corner of South Donahue and West Samford, right next to the baseball stadium. These are luxury suites consisting of two bedrooms with a shared common area. Each bedroom has a double-sized bed, and each suite comes fit with a mounted flat-screen TV and its own washer and dryer units.

===Greek life===
Greek associated students make up roughly 24 percent of undergraduate men and 34 percent of women at Auburn.

Male Greeks in Auburn are roughly divided into two separate areas: "Old Row" and "New Row". "Old Row" traditionally was made up of the fraternities whose houses were located along Magnolia Avenue on the north side of campus. "New Row" is made up of fraternities whose houses were located along Lem Morrison Drive southwest of campus. However, being an "Old Row" or "New Row" fraternity does not really depend on where the house is located but on the age of the fraternity. Therefore, there are some "Old Row" fraternities with houses on "New Row" Lem Morrison Drive because they moved there. Today's "Old Row" on and around Magnolia Avenue was once the "New Row", as the first generation of fraternity houses at Auburn were on or near College Street. Most of these houses were demolished by the end of the 1970s, and only the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and [[Chi Phi]] fraternities remain. Some fraternities are not located on either "New Row" or "Old Row".

There are seventeen social sororities represented at Auburn University. [[Sorority Recruitment|Sorority recruitment]] is a week-long process held by the Panhellenic Council in August every year. Sororities are located not in individual houses like Auburn fraternities, but in the designated dorms located in The Village. This has the unintended side effect of keeping dues for these sororities among the lowest in the nation. Each dorm has a sorority "chapter" room within it for the sorority designated to that dorm.

NPHC (National Pan-Hellenic Council) Organizations represented on Auburn's Campus are: 

Fraternities:
Alpha Phi Alpha, Kappa Alpha Psi, Omega Psi Phi, Phi Beta Sigma

Sororities:
Alpha Kappa Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, Zeta Phi Beta (Inactive), Sigma Gamma Rho (Inactive)

{{Main|Auburn Tigers}}

Auburn University's sports teams are known as the '''Tigers''', and they participate in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-A]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and in the Western Division of the 14-member [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). [[War Eagle]] is the battle cry and greeting used by the Auburn Family (students, alumni, and fans). Auburn has won a total of 19 intercollegiate national championships (including 17 NCAA Championships), which includes 2 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|football]] (1957, 2010), 8 [[NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships|men's swimming and diving]] (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009), 5 [[NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships|women's swimming and diving]] (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007), 2 [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] (2008, 2011), and 1 [[NCAA Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|women's outdoor track and field]] (2006) titles. Auburn has also won a total of 70 [[Southeastern Conference]] championships, including 51 men's titles and 19 women's titles. Auburn's colors of burnt orange and navy blue were chosen by [[George Petrie (American football)|Dr. George Petrie]], Auburn's first football coach, based on those of his alma mater, the [[University of Virginia]].

===Football===
[[File:Auburn Tigers.jpg|thumb|right|Tiger statue outside [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]]]]
{{Main|Auburn Tigers football}}

<!-- Editors, please consider adding new content to the main article, [[Auburn Tigers football]] instead. -->
Auburn named [[Gus Malzahn]] as the new football head coach on December 4, 2012. Other past coaches include [[Gene Chizik]], [[George Petrie (American football)|George Petrie]], [[John Heisman]], [[Mike Donahue]], [[Jack Meagher]], [[Ralph Jordan|Ralph "Shug" Jordan]], [[Pat Dye]], [[Terry Bowden]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]].

Auburn played its first game in 1892 against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]] at [[Piedmont Park]] in [[Atlanta]] starting what is currently the oldest college football rivalry in the [[Deep South]]. Auburn's first perfect season came in [[1913 Auburn Tigers football team|1913]], when the Tigers went 8-0, claiming a second SIAA conference championship and the first national championship in school history. The Tigers' first bowl appearance was in 1937 in the sixth [[Bacardi Bowl]] played in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. AU football has won twelve SEC Conference Championships, and since the division of the conference in 1992, seven western division championships and four trips to the SEC Championship game. Auburn plays arch-rival [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] each year in a game known as the [[Iron Bowl]].

In [[1957 Auburn Tigers football team|1957]], Auburn was coached by "Shug" Jordan to a 10–0 record and was awarded the AP National Championship. Ohio State University was first in the UPI coaches' poll. Auburn was ineligible for a bowl game, however, having been placed on probation by the Southeastern Conference.

Three Auburn players, [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in 1971, [[Bo Jackson]] in 1985, and [[Cam Newton]] in 2010 have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]. The Trophy's namesake, [[John Heisman]], coached at Auburn from 1895 until 1899. Auburn is the only school where Heisman coached (among others, [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]) that has produced a Heisman Trophy winner. Auburn's [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]] has a capacity of 87,451 ranking as the ninth-largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA as of September 2006.

[[File:Jordan hare stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jordan–Hare Stadium]], 2005]]
Auburn went 11–0 under Terry Bowden in 1993, but was on probation and not allowed to play in the SEC Championship game. Auburn completed the 2004 football season with a 13–0 record winning the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship, the school's first conference title since 1989 and the first outright title since 1987. The 2004 team was led by quarterback [[Jason Campbell]], running backs [[Carnell Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]], and cornerback [[Carlos Rogers (American football)|Carlos Rogers]], all subsequently drafted in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. The team's new offensive coordinator, [[Al Borges]], led the team to use the [[west coast offense|west coast style offense]] which maximized the use of both star running backs. However, the Tigers were ranked behind two other undefeated teams, [[2004 USC Trojans football team|Southern California]] and [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], that played in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] championship game.

Prior to the 2008 season, Tony Franklin was hired as offensive coordinator to put Auburn into the spread offense. He was fired, however, following the sixth game of the season that ended in a loss to Vanderbilt. Tommy Tuberville then resigned as head coach after the season. On December 13, 2008, it was reported that [[Gene Chizik]] had been hired as Auburn's new head coach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |title=Auburn hires Gene Chizik as football coach |accessdate=2008-12-13 |date=2008-12-13 |publisher=Sporting News| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081216160910/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642| archivedate= 16 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Coach Gene Chizik then hired [[Gus Malzahn]] as the Tigers' new Offensive Coordinator.

[[File:Rolling Toomers Corner Auburn University.jpg|thumb|left|The Auburn tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner after a sports win]]
In [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|2010]], Auburn defeated [[2010 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]] 22–19 in the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]] to secure the school's second national championship. The Tigers finished the season with a 14–0 record, including comeback wins over [[2010 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]], [[2010 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], and [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers trailed the Tide 24–0 in Tuscaloosa, but managed a 28–27 comeback victory in the 75th edition of the [[Iron Bowl]]. Auburn would again defeat South Carolina 56–17 in the [[2010 SEC Championship Game]], claiming the school's eleventh conference championship. The Tigers were led by head coach Gene Chizik, offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner [[Cam Newton]], and defensive tackle and Lombardi Award winner [[Nick Fairley]].

===Hey Day===
In the 1950s and 60s Auburn designated a day on campus called "Hey Day" that encouraged students to interact with each other and simply say "hey." Auburn reinstated this tradition in 1985 and has continued to evolve until this day. On Hey Days now, students are asked to put on name tags, handed out by student body leaders, and encouraged to say "hey" to whomever may pass them by during the day.<ref name="Auburn Traditions">{{cite web|url=http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|title=AuburnTigers.com - Official Athletics Site of the Auburn Tigers - Traditions|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref>

===Auburn's Eagles===
Auburn has currently three eagles in their flight program for educational initiatives. One of these educational programs is known as the pregame flight program where the eagle handlers set an eagle free before Auburn takes the field at Jordan Hare Stadium. The eagle then proceeds to fly around the stadium and eventually land in the middle of the field.

Tiger, Auburn's first eagle, was born in 1980 in captivity and given to Auburn University in 1986 . Tiger's first flight before an Auburn Football game came against Wyoming in 2000. She retired after the Georgia game in 2006. Throughout Tiger's career, she flew many different flights and at many different venues including the 2002 Winter Olympics.<ref name="Auburn Traditions" />
 
Auburn's second Flight program eagle is Nova. Her first flight came before Auburn's game against Kentucky in 2004. She was born at the Montgomery zoo and given to Auburn a year later.  
 
Spirit is the only Bald Eagle Auburn has used for its pregame flight program. His first flight was in 2000. Spirit was found as a baby with an injured beak and nursed back to health before being given to Auburn for further rehabilitation in 1998 . Unfortunately, Spirit's beak was damaged to the point that it is impossible for his release back into the wild.<ref name="Auburn Traditions" />

===Aubie the Tiger===

Auburns mascot, Aubie the tiger has been around since 1959. He made his first appearance that year on the Oct 3 gameday football program versus Hardin-Simmons College. Aubie was the creation of Birmingham Post-Herald artist Phil Neel and was the focal point of Auburn's football programs for 18 years. Auburn Football Experienced good luck while Aubie remained on the cover ending with a 23-2-1 home record and 63-16-2 overall record while he was on the football cover. Aubie the tiger is still currently Auburn's official mascot and has won the most National Mascot titles in the contest's history, with eight.<ref name="Auburn Tigers">{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/auburnfootball/|title=Auburn football - Auburn Tigers Football NCAA News from al.com|work=al.com|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref>

===Auburn Football Tiger Walk===

Auburn's Tiger Walk began in the 1960s, after fans would try to stop the players and get autographs before the games. It has since evolved into the spectacle, where fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they make their way from the athletic complex to the field. The highest point of the tiger walk came in 1989, when Auburn and Alabama played each other for the first time away from [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. It is estimated that around 20,000 Auburn fans came out and lined the street to cheer on the team that day.<ref name="Auburn Traditions" />

===War Eagle Chant Theories===

During Auburn's game against Georgia in 1892, a civil war veteran in the stands brought his pet eagle that he found on a battleground during the war. The eagle during the game flew away from the soldier and began circling the field in the air. As all this went on, Auburn began marching down the field to eventually score the game winning touchdown. At the end of the game, the eagle dove into the ground and subsequently died; however, the Auburn faithful took the eagle as an omen of success and coined the phrase "WAR EAGLE" in turn.<ref name="Auburn Tigers" />
 
During a game against the Carlisle Indian Team in 1914, Auburn attempted to single out Carlisle's toughest player, Bald Eagle. To tire him out, they began running the ball his way during every play, by saying "bald eagle", while in formation. The crowd mistook this and began yelling "War Eagle", instead, leading to Auburn's player, Lucy Hairston, to yell "War Eagle: at the end of the game, after he scored the game-winning touchdown.<ref name="Auburn Traditions" />

During a pep rally in 1913, a cheerleader said that the team would have to fight the whole game because the game meant "war." At the same time of the rally, an eagle emblem fell on a student's military hat. When asked what it was, he yelled it was a "War Eagle".<ref name="Auburn Traditions" />

After a battle, the Saxon Indians' warriors would yell "War Eagle", when the buzzards started to circle the battlefields. Some believe that Auburn coined its battle cry from this practice by the Saxon Indians.<ref name="Auburn Traditions" />

===Toomer's Corner===

The tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner on Auburn's campus after home and big away victories is thought to have originated in the 1950s. The tradition is thought to have spawned from when the owner of Toomer's Drugs, Sheldon Toomer, would toss his receipt paper into the trees to signal an Auburn road victory.<ref name="Toomer's Corner">{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2257393-behind-the-auburn-tradition-of-rolling-toomers-corner|title=Behind the Auburn Tradition of Rolling Toomer's Corner|author=BR Studios|work=Bleacher Report|accessdate=29 May 2015}}</ref>
