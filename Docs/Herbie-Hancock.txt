'''Herbert Jeffrey''' "'''Herbie'''" '''Hancock''' (born April 12, 1940) is an American pianist, keyboardist, bandleader, composer and actor.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/254052/Herbie-Hancock |title=Herbie Hancock (American musician) |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=February 1, 2012}}</ref> Starting his career with [[Donald Byrd]], he shortly thereafter joined the [[Miles Davis Quintet]] where Hancock helped to redefine the role of a jazz [[rhythm section]] and was one of the primary architects of the [[post-bop]] sound. He was one of the first jazz musicians to embrace synthesizers and [[funk]] music. Hancock's music is often melodic and accessible; he has had many songs "cross over" and achieved success among pop audiences. His music embraces elements of funk and [[soul music|soul]] while adopting freer stylistic elements from [[jazz]]. In his jazz improvisation, he possesses a unique creative blend of jazz, blues, and modern classical music, with harmonic stylings much like the styles of [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]].

Hancock's best-known compositions include "[[Cantaloupe Island]]", "[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]" (later performed by dozens of musicians, including bandleader [[Mongo Santamaría]]), "[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]", "[[Chameleon (composition)|Chameleon]]", and the singles "I Thought It Was You" and "[[Rockit]]". His 2007 [[tribute album]] ''[[River: The Joni Letters]]'' won the 2008 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], only the second jazz album ever to win the award, after ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'' in 1965.

== Early life and career ==

Hancock was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], the son of Winnie Belle (Griffin), a secretary, and Wayman Edward Hancock, a government meat inspector.<ref>http://www.filmreference.com/film/60/Herbie-Hancock.html</ref> His parents named him after the singer and actor [[Herb Jeffries]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hancock|first1=Herbie|title=The Ethics of Jazz|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPFXC3q1tTg|website=Youtube.com|publisher=Mahindra Humanities Center|accessdate=4 February 2016|location=11:50|date=February 2014}}</ref> He attended the [[Wendell Phillips High School]]. Like many jazz pianists, Hancock started with a [[classical music]] education. He studied from age seven, and his talent was recognized early. Considered a [[child prodigy]],<ref name="Prodigy">{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/7924263/Herbie-Hancock-interview.html |title=Herbie Hancock interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=August 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 1, 2012 |author=Hentz, Stefan}}</ref> he played the first movement of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 26 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 26 in D Major, K. 537 ''(Coronation)'']] at a young people's concert on February 5, 1952, with the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] (led by CSO assistant conductor [[George Schick]]) at the age of 11.<ref name="grove">{{GroveOnline|Herbie Hancock|Dobbins, Bill and Kernfeld, Barry|February 19|2007}}</ref>

Through his teens, Hancock never had a jazz teacher, but developed his ear and sense of harmony. He was also influenced by records of the vocal group [[the Hi-Lo's]]. He reported that:<blockquote>the time I actually heard the Hi-Lo's, I started picking that stuff out; my ear was happening. I could hear stuff and that's when I really learned some much farther-out voicings – like the harmonies I used on ''Speak Like a Child'' – just being able to do that. I really got that from [[Clare Fischer]]'s arrangements for the Hi-Lo's. Clare Fischer was a major influence on my harmonic concept.... He and [[Bill Evans]], and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]] and [[Gil Evans]], finally. You know, that's where it came from.<ref>{{cite book |title=Jazz-Rock Fusion, the people, the music. |author1=Coryell, Julie  |author2=Friedman, Laura |year=2000 |publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]] |page=204 |ISBN=0-7935-9941-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwWdk3x9u28C}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1960, he heard [[Chris Anderson (piano)|Chris Anderson]] play just once, and begged him to accept him as a student.<ref name="Mapleshade testimonial">{{cite web |url=http://www.mapleshaderecords.com/cds/56922.php |title=CHRIS ANDERSON |work=Review of ''Love Locked Out'' |publisher=Mapleshade Music |accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref> Hancock often mentions Anderson as his harmonic guru. Hancock left [[Grinnell College]], moved to Chicago and began working with [[Donald Byrd]] and [[Coleman Hawkins]], during which period he also took courses at [[Roosevelt University]]. (He later graduated from Grinnell with degrees in electrical engineering and music. Grinnell also awarded him an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree in 1972.<ref name="grove" /><ref>The tune "Dr Honoris Causa" written by [[Joe Zawinul]] and performed by [[Cannonball Adderley]]'s quintet is an ironic celebration of the honorary degree.</ref>) Byrd was attending the [[Manhattan School of Music]] in New York at the time and suggested that Hancock study composition with [[Vittorio Giannini]], which he did for a short time in 1960. The pianist quickly earned a reputation, and played subsequent sessions with [[Oliver Nelson]] and [[Phil Woods]]. He recorded his first solo album ''[[Takin' Off]]'' for [[Blue Note Records]] in 1962. "[[Watermelon Man (composition)|Watermelon Man]]" (from ''Takin' Off'') was to provide [[Mongo Santamaría]] with a hit single, but more importantly for Hancock, ''Takin' Off'' caught the attention of [[Miles Davis]], who was at that time assembling a new band. Hancock was introduced to Davis by the young drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]], a member of the new band.

== Miles Davis Quintet (1963–68) and Blue Note Records (1962–69) ==
Hancock received considerable attention when, in May 1963,<ref name="grove" /> he joined Davis's [[Miles Davis Quintet#Second Great Quintet (1964–68)|Second Great Quintet]]. Davis personally sought out Hancock, whom he saw as one of the most promising talents in jazz. The [[rhythm section]] Davis organized was young but effective, comprising bassist [[Ron Carter]], 17-year-old drummer Williams, and Hancock on piano. After [[George Coleman]] and [[Sam Rivers]] each took a turn at the saxophone spot, the quintet gelled with [[Wayne Shorter]] on tenor saxophone. This quintet is often regarded as one of the finest jazz ensembles,<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/oct/13/miles-davis-second-great-quintet 50 great moments in jazz: How Miles Davis's second quintet changed jazz], theguardian.com</ref> and the rhythm section has been especially praised for its innovation and flexibility.{{by whom|date=December 2013}}

The second great quintet was where Hancock found his own voice as a pianist. Not only did he find new ways to use common chords, but he also popularized chords that had not previously been used in jazz. Hancock also developed a unique taste for "orchestral" accompaniment – using [[quartal harmony]] and [[Debussy]]-like harmonies, with stark contrasts then unheard of in jazz. With Williams and Carter he wove a labyrinth of rhythmic intricacy on, around and over existing melodic and chordal schemes. In the latter half of the 1960s their approach became so sophisticated and unorthodox that conventional [[chord progression|chord changes]] would hardly be discernible; hence their improvisational concept would become known as "Time, No Changes".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

While in Davis's band, Hancock also found time to record dozens of sessions for the Blue Note label, both under his own name and as a [[sideman]] with other musicians such as Shorter, Williams, [[Grant Green]], [[Bobby Hutcherson]], Rivers, Byrd, [[Kenny Dorham]], [[Hank Mobley]], [[Lee Morgan]] and [[Freddie Hubbard]].

His albums ''[[Empyrean Isles]]'' (1964) and ''[[Maiden Voyage (Herbie Hancock album)|Maiden Voyage]]'' (1965) were to be two of the most famous and influential jazz [[LP (format)|LPs]] of the 1960s, winning praise for both their innovation and accessibility (the latter demonstrated by the subsequent enormous popularity of the ''Maiden Voyage'' title track as a jazz standard, and by the [[jazz rap]] group [[US3]] having a hit single with "[[Cantaloop]]" (derived from "Cantaloupe Island" on ''Empyrean Isles'') some twenty five years later). ''Empyrean Isles'' featured the Davis rhythm section of Hancock, Carter and Williams with the addition of Hubbard on [[cornet]], while ''Maiden Voyage'' also added former Davis saxophonist Coleman (with Hubbard remaining on trumpet). Both albums are regarded as among the principal foundations of the [[post-bop]] style.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}
Hancock also recorded several less-well-known but still critically acclaimed albums with larger ensembles – ''[[My Point of View]]'' (1963), ''[[Speak Like a Child (album)|Speak Like a Child]]'' (1968) and ''[[The Prisoner (album)|The Prisoner]]'' (1969) featured [[flugelhorn]], [[alto flute]] and [[bass trombone]]. 1963's ''[[Inventions and Dimensions]]'' was an album of almost entirely improvised music, teaming Hancock with bassist [[Paul Chambers]] and two Latin percussionists, [[Willie Bobo]] and [[Osvaldo "Chihuahua" Martinez]].

During this period, Hancock also composed the [[Film scores|score]] to [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s film ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966), the first of many [[film soundtrack]]s he recorded in his career.  As well as feature film soundtracks, Hancock recorded a number of musical themes used on American television commercials for such then well known products as [[Pillsbury Company|Pillsbury]]'s [[Space Food Sticks]], [[Standard Oil]], [[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]] diet cola and [[Virginia Slims]] cigarettes. Hancock also wrote, arranged and conducted a spy type theme for a series of [[F. William Free]] commercials for [[Silva Thins]] cigarettes.  Hancock liked it so much he wished to record it as a song but the ad agency would not let him.  He rewrote the harmony, tempo and tone and recorded the piece as the track "He Who Lives in Fear" from his ''The Prisoner'' album of 1969.<ref>Hancock, Herbie & Dickey, Lisa  ''Herbie Hancock: Possibilities'' Penguin, 23 Oct 2014</ref>

Davis had begun incorporating elements of rock and popular music into his recordings by the end of Hancock's tenure with the band. Despite some initial reluctance, Hancock began doubling on electric [[Keyboard instruments|keyboards]] including the [[Fender Rhodes]] [[electric piano]] at Davis's insistence. Hancock adapted quickly to the new instruments, which proved to be important in his future artistic endeavors.

Under the pretext that he had returned late from a honeymoon in Brazil, Hancock was dismissed from Davis's band. In the summer of 1968 Hancock formed his own sextet. However, although Davis soon disbanded his quintet to search for a new sound, Hancock, despite his departure from the working band, continued to appear on Davis records for the next few years. Appearances included ''[[In a Silent Way]]'', ''[[A Tribute to Jack Johnson]]'' and ''[[On the Corner]]''.

== ''Fat Albert'' (1969) and ''Mwandishi'' (1971) ==
[[File:Herbie Hancock.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hancock playing a [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] AX-7 [[keytar]], at [[The Roundhouse]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], London, 2006]]
Hancock left Blue Note in 1969, signing with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. In 1969, Hancock composed the soundtrack for the [[Bill Cosby]] animated children's television show ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]''. Titled ''[[Fat Albert Rotunda]]'' (1969), the album was mainly an [[R&B]]-influenced album with strong jazz overtones. One of the jazzier songs on the record, "Tell Me a Bedtime Story", was later re-worked as a more electronic sounding song for the [[Quincy Jones]] album, ''[[Sounds...and Stuff Like That!! ]]'' (1978).

Hancock became fascinated with accumulating musical gadgets and toys. Together with the profound influence of Davis's ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970), this fascination would culminate in a series of albums, in which electronic instruments are coupled with acoustic instruments.

Hancock's first ventures into [[electronic music]] started with a sextet comprising Hancock, bassist [[Buster Williams]] and drummer [[Billy Hart]], and a trio of horn players: [[Eddie Henderson (musician)|Eddie Henderson]] (trumpet), [[Julian Priester]] ([[trombone]]), and [[multireedist]] [[Bennie Maupin]]. [[Patrick Gleeson]] was eventually added to the mix to play and program the synthesizers. In fact, Hancock was one of the first jazz pianists to completely embrace electronic keyboards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The sextet, later a septet with the addition of Gleeson, made three albums under Hancock's name: ''[[Mwandishi]]'' (1971), ''[[Crossings (Herbie Hancock album)|Crossings]]'' (1972) (both on Warner Bros. Records), and ''[[Sextant (album)|Sextant]]'' (1973) (released on [[Columbia Records]]); two more, ''Realization'' and ''Inside Out'', were recorded under Henderson's name with essentially the same personnel. The music exhibited strong improvisational aspect beyond the confines of jazz mainstream and showed influence from the electronic music of [[contemporary music|contemporary classical]] composers.

Synthesizer player Gleeson introduced the instrument on ''Crossings'', released in 1972, one of a handful of influential electronic jazz/fusion recordings to feature synthesizer that year. On ''Crossings'' (as well as on [[Weather Report]]'s ''[[I Sing the Body Electric (album)|I Sing the Body Electric]]''), the synthesizer is used more as an improvisatory global orchestration device than as a strictly melodic instrument. An early review of ''Crossings'' in ''[[Downbeat magazine]]'' complained about the synthesizer, but a few years later the magazine noted in a cover story on Gleeson that he was "a pioneer" in the field of electronics in jazz.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} In the albums following ''The Crossings'', Hancock started to play synth himself, with synth taking on a melodic role.

Hancock's three records released in 1971–73 later became known as the "Mwandishi" albums, so-called after a [[Swahili language|Swahili]] name Hancock sometimes used during this era (''Mwandishi'' is Swahili for ''writer''). The first two, including ''[[Fat Albert Rotunda]]'' were made available on the 2-CD set ''Mwandishi: the Complete Warner Bros. Recordings'', released in 1994. Of the three electronic albums, ''[[Sextant (album)|Sextant]]'' is probably the most experimental since the ARP synthesizers are used extensively, and some advanced improvisation ("post-modal free impressionism") is found on the tracks "Hornets" and "Hidden Shadows" (which is in the [[time signature|meter]] 19/4).{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} "Hornets" was later revised on the 2001 album ''[[Future2Future]]'' as "Virtual Hornets".

Among the instruments Hancock and Gleeson used were [[Fender Rhodes]] piano, [[ARP Odyssey]], [[ARP 2600]], [[ARP Pro Soloist]] Synthesizer, a [[Mellotron]] and the [[Moog synthesizer]] III.

All three Warner Bros. albums ''Fat Albert Rotunda'' (1969), ''Mwandishi'' (1971), and ''Crossings'' (1972), were remastered in 2001 and released in Europe but were not released in the US as of June 2005. In the winter of 2006–7 a remastered edition of ''Crossings'' was announced and scheduled for release in the spring.{{Update inline|date=November 2013}}

== From ''Head Hunters'' (1973) to ''Secrets'' (1976) ==
{{See also|Head Hunters}}
[[File:HerbieHancock.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hancock playing in Vredenburg, Utrecht, Netherlands, December, 2006]]
After the sometimes "airy" and decidedly experimental "Mwandishi" albums, Hancock was eager to perform more "earthy" and "[[funk]]y" music. The ''Mwandishi'' albums – though later seen as respected early fusion recordings – had seen mixed reviews and poor sales, so it is probable that Hancock was motivated by financial concerns as well as artistic restlessness.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Hancock was also bothered by the fact that many people did not understand avant-garde music. He explained that he loved funk music, especially [[Sly Stone]]'s music, so he wanted to try to make funk himself.

He gathered a new band, which he called [[The Headhunters]], keeping only Maupin from the sextet and adding bassist [[Paul Jackson (bassist)|Paul Jackson]], percussionist [[Bill Summers (percussionist)|Bill Summers]], and drummer [[Harvey Mason]]. The album ''[[Head Hunters (album)|Head Hunters]]'', released in 1973, was a major hit and crossed over to pop audiences, though it prompted criticism from some jazz fans.

Despite charges of "[[selling out]]", [[Stephen Erlewine]] of [[AllMusic]] positively reviewed the album among other friendly critics, saying, "''Head Hunters'' still sounds fresh and vital three decades after its initial release, and its genre-bending proved vastly influential on not only jazz, but funk, [[Soul music|soul]], and [[hip hop music|hip-hop]]."<ref name="Headhunters ''Allmusic'' review">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=album |id=r140166/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Headhunters Herbie Hancock|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|year=2010|work=''Allmusic'' review of ''Headhunters''|accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>

Drummer Mason was replaced by [[Mike Clark (jazz musician)|Mike Clark]], and the band released a second album, ''[[Thrust (album)|Thrust]]'', the following year, 1974. (A live album from a Japan performance, consisting of compositions from those first two ''Head Hunters'' releases was released in 1975 as ''[[Flood (Herbie Hancock album)|Flood]]''.) This was almost as well received as its predecessor, if not attaining the same level of commercial success. The Headhunters made another successful album called ''[[Survival of the Fittest (The Headhunters album)|Survival of the Fittest]]'' in 1975 without Hancock, while Hancock himself started to make even more commercial albums, often featuring members of the band, but no longer billed as The Headhunters. The Headhunters reunited with Hancock in 1998 for ''[[Return of the Headhunters]]'', and a version of the band (featuring Jackson and Clark) continues to play and record.

In 1973, Hancock composed his soundtrack to the controversial film ''[[The Spook Who Sat by the Door (film)|The Spook Who Sat by the Door]]''. Then in 1974, he also composed the soundtrack to the first ''[[Death Wish (film)|Death Wish]]'' film. One of his memorable songs, "Joanna's Theme", was re-recorded in 1997 on his duet album with Shorter, ''[[1 + 1 (album)|1 + 1]]''.

Hancock's next jazz-funk albums of the 1970s were ''[[Man-Child]]'' (1975), and ''[[Secrets (Herbie Hancock album)|Secrets]]'' (1976), which point toward the more commercial direction Hancock would take over the next decade. These albums feature the members of the Headhunters band, but also a variety of other musicians in important roles.

== From ''V.S.O.P.'' (1976–) to ''Future Shock'' (1983) ==
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Hancock toured with his [[V.S.O.P. (group)|V.S.O.P. quintet]], which featured all the members of the 1960s Davis quintet except Davis, who was replaced by trumpeter Hubbard. There was constant speculation that one day Davis would reunite with his classic band, but he never did so. VSOP recorded several live albums in the late 1970s, including ''[[VSOP: The Quintet|The Quintet]]'' (1977).

In 1978, Hancock recorded a duet with [[Chick Corea]], who had replaced him in the Davis band a decade earlier. Hancock also released a solo acoustic piano album titled ''[[The Piano (Herbie Hancock album)|The Piano]]'' (1979), which, like so many Hancock albums at the time, was initially released only in Japan. (It was finally released in the US in 2004.) Several other Japan-only releases have yet{{when|date=October 2013}} to appear in the US, such as ''[[Dedication (Herbie Hancock album)|Dedication]]'' (1974), ''[[VSOP: Tempest in the Colosseum|V.S.O.P.'s Tempest in the Colosseum]]'' (1977), and ''[[Direct Step]]'' (1978). ''[[VSOP: Live Under the Sky|Live Under the Sky]]'' was a VSOP album remastered for the US in 2004, and included an entire second concert from the July 1979 tour.

From 1978 to 1982, Hancock recorded many albums consisting of jazz-inflected [[disco]] and pop music, beginning with ''[[Sunlight (jazz album)|Sunlight]]'' (featuring guest musicians including Williams and Pastorius on the last track) (1978). Singing through a [[vocoder]], he earned a British hit,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=2006 |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |edition=19th |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |location=London |isbn=1-904994-10-5 |page=242}}</ref> "I Thought It Was You", although critics were unimpressed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warr.org/hancock.html |title=Herbie Hancock |publisher=Warr.org |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}</ref> This led to more vocoder on 1979 follow-up, ''[[Feets, Don't Fail Me Now]]'', which gave him another UK hit in "You Bet Your Love".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" />

Albums such as ''[[Monster (jazz album)|Monster]]'' (1980), ''[[Magic Windows (album)|Magic Windows]]'' (1981), and ''[[Lite Me Up (album)|Lite Me Up]]'' (1982) were some of Hancock's most criticized and unwelcomed albums, the market at the time being somewhat saturated with similar pop-jazz hybrids from the likes of former bandmate Hubbard. Hancock himself had quite a limited role in some of those albums, leaving singing, composing and even producing to others. ''[[Mr. Hands (album)|Mr. Hands]]'' (1980) is perhaps the one album during this period, that was critically acclaimed. To the delight of many fans, there were no vocals on the album, and one track featured Pastorius on bass. The album contained a wide variety of different styles, including a disco instrumental song, a Latin-jazz number and an electronic piece, in which Hancock plays alone with the help of computers.

Hancock also found time to record more traditional jazz while creating more commercially oriented music. He toured with Williams and Carter in 1981, recording ''[[Herbie Hancock Trio (1982 album)|Herbie Hancock Trio]]'', a five-track live album released only in Japan. A month later, he recorded ''[[Quartet (Herbie Hancock album)|Quartet]]'' with trumpeter [[Wynton Marsalis]], released in the US the following year. Hancock, Williams and Carter toured internationally with Wynton and his brother, saxophonist [[Branford Marsalis]], in what was known as "VSOP II". This quintet can be heard on Marsalis's debut album on Columbia (1981). In 1984 VSOP II performed at the Playboy Jazz Festival as a sextet with Hancock, Williams, Carter, the Marsalis Brothers and the addition of a third member into the horn section by way of [[Bobby McFerrin]] contributing his unique vocal stylings.

In 1982 Hancock contributed to the [[Simple Minds]] album ''[[New Gold Dream (81,82,83,84)]]'', playing a synthesizer solo on the track "Hunter and the Hunted".

In 1983, Hancock had a [[mainstream]] hit with the Grammy-award winning instrumental single "[[Rockit]]" from the album ''[[Future Shock (Herbie Hancock album)|Future Shock]]''. It was the first [[Jazz rap|jazz hip-hop]] song<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfrG1IKZ9f8C&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=Herbie+Hancock+Rockit+first+jazz+hip+hop&source=bl&ots=4AWslJ9lpj&sig=hTQg7zbn9nfqHTGDgkmGWWi9P3g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=p8YTULmDDdDEsgaKo4GwCg&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Herbie%20Hancock%20Rockit%20first%20jazz%20hip%20hop&f=false |title=Music Cultures in the United States: An Introduction |page=364 |last=Koskoff |first=Ellen |publisher=Routledge |location=[[New York]], [[NY]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-415-96588-8 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q84TiHcqDqcC&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=Herbie+Hancock+Rockit+first+jazz+hip+hop&source=bl&ots=bThBgh0Mq0&sig=MddvMPrllD5sFktKF4wNeV9DDCY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=p8YTULmDDdDEsgaKo4GwCg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Herbie%20Hancock%20Rockit%20first%20jazz%20hip%20hop&f=false |title=Hip Hop Culture |page=114 |last=Price |first=Emmett George |publisher=ABC-CLIO, Inc. |location=[[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[California]] |year=2006 |isbn=1-85109-867-4 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HRmRqtD6oPgC&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=Herbie+Hancock+Rockit+first+jazz+hip+hop&source=bl&ots=jU98B9Oea9&sig=wpKZdsTxJwD37jSkyYA_1itBsnY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=p8YTULmDDdDEsgaKo4GwCg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Herbie%20Hancock%20Rockit%20first%20jazz%20hip%20hop&f=false |title=Rap music and street consciousness |page=109 |last=Keyes |first=Cheryl Lynette |publisher=Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois |location=[[Illinois]] |year=2004 |isbn=0-252-02761-2 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> and became a worldwide anthem for the [[breakdancer]]s and for the [[Hip hop|hip-hop culture]] of the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3616743/Culture-quake-Rockit.html |title=Culture quake: Rockit |first=Will |last=Hodgkinson |publisher=Telegraph |date=May 10, 2004 |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monkinstitute.org/meet/herbiehancock.php |title=Meet – Herbie Hancock |publisher=Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref> It was also the first mainstream single to feature [[scratching]], and also featured an innovative animated music video, which was directed by [[Godley and Creme]] and showed several robot-like artworks by [[Jim Whiting]].

[[Omnibus Press]] (ISBN 0711990751), 2002, p.447</ref> The video won in five categories at the inaugural [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. This single ushered in a collaboration with noted bassist and producer [[Bill Laswell]]. Hancock experimented with electronic music on a string of three LPs produced by Laswell: ''Future Shock'' (1983), the Grammy Award-winning ''[[Sound-System (album)|Sound-System]]'' (1984), and ''[[Perfect Machine (album)|Perfect Machine]]'' (1988).

During this period, he appeared onstage at the [[Grammy Awards]] with [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Howard Jones (musician)|Howard Jones]], and [[Thomas Dolby]], in a synthesizer [[Jam band|jam]]. Lesser known works from the 1980s are the live album ''[[Jazz Africa]]'' (1987) and the studio album ''[[Village Life (album)|Village Life]]'' (1984), which were recorded with [[Gambia]]n [[Kora (instrument)|kora]] player [[Foday Musa Suso]].<ref>[http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/3feb50074a703d1a]  {{wayback|url=http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/3feb50074a703d1a |date=20121202034922 }}</ref> Also, in 1985 Hancock performed as a guest on the album ''[[So Red the Rose]]'' (1985) by the [[Duran Duran]] spinoff group [[Arcadia (band)|Arcadia]]. He also provided introductory and closing comments for the [[PBS]] rebroadcast in the United States of the [[BBC]] educational series from the mid-1980s, ''[[Rockschool]]'' (not to be confused with the most recent ''Gene Simmons' Rock School'' series).

In 1986 Hancock performed and acted in the film ''[[Round Midnight (film)|'Round Midnight]]''. He also wrote the score/soundtrack, for which he won an [[Academy Award for Original Music Score]]. Often he would write music for TV commercials. "Maiden Voyage", in fact, started out as a cologne advertisement. At the end of the ''Perfect Machine'' tour, Hancock decided to leave Columbia Records after a 15-plus-year relationship.

After a break following his leaving of Columbia, Hancock, together with Carter, Williams, Shorter, and Davis admirer [[Wallace Roney]], recorded ''[[A Tribute to Miles]]'', which was released in 1994. The album contained two live recordings and studio recording songs, with Roney playing Davis's part as trumpet player. The album won a Grammy for best group album. Hancock also toured with [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Dave Holland]] and [[Pat Metheny]] in 1990 on their ''[[Parallel Realities]]'' tour, which included a performance at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in July 1990.

Hancock's next album, ''[[Dis Is da Drum]]'', released in 1994, saw him return to [[acid jazz]]. Also in 1994, he appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album ''[[Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool]]''. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as "Album of the Year" by ''[[Time Magazine]]''.

1995's ''[[The New Standard (Herbie Hancock album)|The New Standard]]'' found Hancock and an all-star band including [[John Scofield]], DeJohnette and [[Michael Brecker]], interpreting pop songs by [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[the Beatles]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Peter Gabriel]] and others.

A 1997 duet album with Shorter, entitled ''1 + 1'', was successful; the song "Aung San Suu Kyi" winning the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition. Hancock also achieved great success in 1998 with his album ''[[Gershwin's World]]'', which featured readings of [[George Gershwin|George]] and [[Ira Gershwin]] standards by Hancock and a plethora of guest stars, including Wonder, [[Joni Mitchell]] and Shorter. Hancock toured the world in support of ''Gershwin's World'' with a sextet that featured [[Cyro Baptista]], [[Terri Lynne Carrington]], [[Ira Coleman]], [[Eli Degibri]] and [[Eddie Henderson (musician)|Eddie Henderson]].

== 2000 to 2009 ==
In 2001 Hancock recorded ''[[Future2Future]]'', which reunited Hancock with Laswell and featured doses of [[electronica]] as well as [[turntablist]] [[Rob Swift]] of [[The X-Ecutioners]]. Hancock later toured with the band, and released a concert DVD with a different lineup, which also included the "Rockit" music video. Also in 2001 Hancock partnered with Brecker and [[Roy Hargrove]] to record a live concert album saluting Davis and [[John Coltrane]], entitled ''[[Directions in Music: Live at Massey Hall]]'', recorded live in Toronto. The threesome toured to support the album, and toured on-and-off through 2005.

The year 2005 saw the release of a duet album called ''[[Possibilities]]''. It featured duets with [[Carlos Santana]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Annie Lennox]], [[John Mayer (musician)|John Mayer]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and others. In 2006 ''Possibilities'' was nominated for Grammy Awards in two categories: "A Song for You", (featuring Aguilera) was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]], and "Gelo No Montanha", (featuring [[Trey Anastasio]] on guitar, was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Performance]], although neither nomination resulted in an award.

Also in 2005 Hancock toured Europe with a new quartet that included [[Benin]]ese guitarist [[Lionel Loueke]], and explored textures ranging from [[ambient music|ambient]] to straight jazz to [[African music]]. Plus, during the summer of 2005, Hancock re-staffed the Headhunters and went on tour with them, including a performance at The [[Bonnaroo]] Music & Arts Festival. This lineup did not consist of any of the original Headhunters musicians. The group included [[Marcus Miller]], Carrington, Loueke and Mayer. Hancock also served as the first artist in residence for Bonnaroo that summer.

Also in 2006 [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]] (which bought out Hancock's old label, Columbia Records) released the two-disc retrospective ''[[The Essential Herbie Hancock]]''. This set was the first compilation of his work at Warner Bros., Blue Note, Columbia and [[Verve Records|Verve]]/[[Polygram Records|Polygram]]. This became Hancock's second major compilation of work since the 2002 Columbia-only ''The Herbie Hancock Box'', which was released at first in a plastic 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;4 cube then re-released in 2004 in a long box set. Also in 2006, Hancock recorded a new song with [[Josh Groban]] and Eric Mouquet (co-founder of [[Deep Forest]]), entitled "Machine". It is featured on Groban's CD ''[[Awake (Josh Groban album)|Awake]]''. Hancock also recorded and improvised with guitarist Loueke on Loueke's 1996 debut album ''Virgin Forest'', on the [[ObliqSound]] label, resulting in two improvisational tracks – "Le Réveil des agneaux (The Awakening of the Lambs)" and  "La Poursuite du lion (The Lion's Pursuit)".

Hancock, a longtime associate and friend of Mitchell, released a 2007 album, ''[[River: The Joni Letters]]'', that paid tribute to her work, with [[Norah Jones]] and [[Tina Turner]], adding vocals to the album,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/hancock.html |title=Key figure: An interview with jazz legend Herbie Hancock |author=Andre Mayer |date=June 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |work=CBC News}}</ref> as did [[Corinne Bailey Rae]].
