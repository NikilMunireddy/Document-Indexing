The '''American Chemical Society''' ('''ACS''') is a [[scientific society]] based in the [[United States]] that supports scientific inquiry in the field of [[chemistry]].  Founded in 1876 at [[New York University]], the ACS currently has more than 158,000 members at all degree levels and in all fields of chemistry, [[chemical engineering]], and related fields. It is the world's largest [[scientific society]] by membership.<ref name=Fast>{{cite web|title=Fast Facts about ACS|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/aboutacs.html|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> The ACS is a [[501(c) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization and holds a [[congressional charter]] under [[Title 36 of the United States Code]]. Its headquarters are located in [[Washington, D.C.]], and it has a large concentration of staff in [[Columbus, Ohio]].

The ACS is a leading source of scientific information through its peer-reviewed scientific journals, national conferences, and the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]]. Its publications division produces 51 [[Scientific journal|scholarly journals]] including the prestigious ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'', as well as the weekly trade magazine ''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]''. The ACS holds national meetings twice a year covering the complete field of chemistry and also holds smaller conferences concentrating on specific chemical fields or geographic regions. The primary source of income of the ACS is the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], a provider of chemical databases worldwide.

The organization also publishes textbooks, administers several national chemistry awards, provides grants for scientific research, and supports various educational and outreach activities.

== History ==
[[File:American Chemical Society Building.JPG|thumb|American Chemical Society headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]

=== Creation ===
In 1874, a group of [[United States|American]] [[chemist]]s gathered at the [[Joseph Priestley House]] to mark the 100th anniversary of [[Joseph Priestley|Priestley's]] discovery of [[oxygen]]. Although there was an American scientific society at that time (the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], founded in 1848), the growth of [[chemistry]] in the U.S. prompted those assembled to consider founding a new society that would focus more directly on theoretical and applied chemistry. Two years later, on 6 April 1876, during a meeting of chemists at the University of the City of New York (now [[New York University]]) the American Chemical Society was founded.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/draperacs.html|title = John W. Draper and the Founding of the American Chemical Society|date = 2001|access-date = 15 Jan 2016|website = |publisher = American Chemical Society|last = Bohning|first = James J.}}</ref> The society received its charter of incorporation from the State of New York in 1877.<ref name=":1" />

[[Charles F. Chandler]], a professor of chemistry at [[Columbia University]] who was instrumental in organizing the society said that such a body would “prove a powerful and healthy stimulus to original research, … would awaken and develop much talent now wasting in isolation, … [bring] members of the association into closer union, and ensure a better appreciation of our science and its students on the part of the general public.”<ref name=":3" />

Although Chandler was a likely choice to become the society's first president because of his role in organizing the society, [[New York University]] chemistry professor [[John William Draper]] was elected as the first president of the society because of his national reputation. Draper was a [[Photochemistry|photochemist]] and pioneering [[photographer]] who had produced one of the first [[Portrait photography|photographic portraits]] in 1840.<ref name=":3" /> Chandler would later serve as president in 1881 and 1889.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|title = ACS Presidents, A Chronological List|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/about/president/acspresidents.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = 2016-01-15}}</ref>

=== Growth and Expansion ===
The ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'' was founded in 1879 to publish original chemical research. It was the first journal published by ACS and is still the society's flagship peer-reviewed publication. In 1907, Chemical Abstracts was established as a separate journal (it previously appeared within JACS), which later became the [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], a division of ACS that provides chemical information to researchers and others worldwide. ''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]'' is a weekly trade magazine that has been published by ACS since 1923.<ref name=":1" />

The society adopted a new constitution aimed at nationalizing the organization in 1890.<ref name=":1" /> In 1905, the American Chemical Society moved from New York City to [[Washington, D.C.]] ACS was reincorporated under a [[congressional charter]] in 1937. It was granted by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] and signed by president [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=Charter>{{cite web|title=ACS Governing Documents Bulletin 5|url=http://www.acs.org/content/dam/acsorg/about/governance/charter/bulletin-5.pdf|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> ACS's headquarters moved to its current location in downtown Washington in 1941.<ref name=":1" />

== Organization ==

=== Divisions ===
ACS first established technical divisions in 1908 to foster the exchange of information among scientists who work in particular fields of chemistry or professional interests. Divisional activities include organizing technical sessions at ACS meetings, publishing books and resources, administering awards and lectureships, and conducting other events. The original five divisions were 1) organic chemistry, 2) industrial chemists and chemical engineers, 3) agricultural and food chemistry, 4) fertilizer chemistry, and 5) physical and inorganic chemistry.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = The American Chemical Society at 125: A recent history 1976-2001|last = |first = |publisher = American Chemical Society|year = 2002|isbn = 0-8412-3851-0|location = |pages = |editor-last = Reese|editor-first = Kenneth M.}}</ref>

Each of these tests consists of 70 multiple-choice questions, and gives students 110 minutes to complete the exam.

The ACS also approves certified undergraduate programs in chemistry. A student who completes the required laboratory and course work—sometimes in excess of what a particular college may require for its [[Bachelor's degree]]—is considered by the Society to be well trained for professional work.<ref>{{Cite conference| title = Undergraduate Professional Education in Chemistry| publisher = American Chemical Society| date = Spring 2008| location = New York| url = http://portal.acs.org/portal/fileFetch/C/WPCP_008491/pdf/WPCP_008491.pdf| accessdate = June 12, 2010}}</ref>

The ACS also coordinates [[National Chemistry Week]] as part of its educational outreach. Since 1977, each year has celebrated a theme, such as "Chemistry colors our world" (2015) and "Energy: Now and forever!" (2013).<ref name=Themes>{{cite web|title=National Chemistry Week Themes|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/outreach/ncw/past.html|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=29 January 2016}}</ref>

=== Green Chemistry Institute ===
The Green Chemistry Institute (GCI) supports the "implementation of [[green chemistry]] and engineering throughout the global chemistry enterprise."<ref>{{Cite web|title = About the ACS Green Chemistry Institute®|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/about.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = 2016-01-16}}</ref> The GCI organizes an annual conference, the Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference, provides research grants, administers awards, and provides information and support for green chemistry practices to educators, researchers, and industry.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ACS Green Chemistry Institute®|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = 2016-01-16}}</ref>

The GCI was founded in 1997 as an independent non-profit organization, by chemists [[Joe Breen (chemist)|Joe Breen]] and Dennis Hjeresen in cooperation with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = A Historical Perspective - Warner Babcock Institute|url = http://www.warnerbabcock.com/green-chemistry/a-historical-perspective/|website = Warner Babcock Institute|access-date = 2016-01-16|language = en-US}}</ref> In 2001, the GCI became a part of the American Chemical Society.[http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/greenchemistry/what-is-green-chemistry/history-of-green-chemistry.html]

=== Petroleum Research Fund ===
The Petroleum Research Fund (PRF) is an endowment fund administered by the ACS that supports advanced education and fundamental research in the petroleum and fossil fuel fields at non-profit institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = ACS Petroleum Research Fund|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/funding-and-awards/grants/prf.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = 2016-01-16}}</ref> Several categories of grants are offered for various career levels and institutions.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Grant Programs|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/funding-and-awards/grants/prf/programs.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = 2016-01-16}}</ref> The fund awarded more than $25 million in grants in 2007.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title = History of the ACS Petroleum Research Fund|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/funding-and-awards/grants/prf/about/history.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = 2016-01-16}}</ref>

The PRF traces its origins to the acquisition of the [[UOP LLC|Universal Oil Products]] laboratory by a consortium of oil companies in 1931.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Universal Oil Products (UOP) Riverside Laboratory - National Historic Chemical Landmarks|url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/uoplaboratory.html|website = American Chemical Society|access-date = 2016-01-16}}</ref> The companies established a trust fund, The Petroleum Research Fund, in 1944 in order to prevent antitrust litigation tied to their UOP assets. The ACS was named the beneficiary of the trust. The first grants from the PRF were awarded in 1954. In 2000, the trust was transferred to the ACS. The ACS established The American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund and the previous trust was dissolved.<ref name=":5" /> The PRF trust was valued at $144.7 million in December 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Financial Highlights - 2014 Annual Report - American Chemical Society|url = https://acswebcontent.acs.org/annualreport/financials.html|website = acswebcontent.acs.org|access-date = 2016-01-16}}</ref>

=== Other programs ===
The ACS International Activities is the birthplace of the ACS International Center, an online resource for scientists and engineers looking to study abroad or explore an international career or internship. The site houses information on hundreds of scholarships and grants related to all levels of experience to promote scientific mobility of researchers and practitioners in STEM fields.

The American Chemical Society grants membership to undergraduates as student members provided they can pay the $25 yearly dues. Any university may start its own ACS Student Chapter and receive benefits of undergraduate participation in regional conferences and discounts on ACS publications.

== Litigation and controversies ==

===  Dialog v. American Chemical Society ===
On June 7, 1990, [[Dialog (online database)|Dialog]] filed a lawsuit against the American Chemical Society,  claiming that the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] had been violated by the ACS and arguing that the ACS' Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) should be required to license its database of scientific abstracts to Dialog.<ref name=Shivley/><ref name="O'Leary"/><ref name=Steinke>{{cite book|last1=Steinke|first1=Cynthia|title=Information seeking and communicating behavior of scientists and engineers|date=1991|publisher=Haworth Press|location=New York|isbn=9781560241355|pages=152–153|edition=Online-Ausg.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0E0SJHuZ6XoC&pg=PA152|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=King>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Julia|title=Lawsuits Threaten ACS' Nonprofit Status, Financial Health|journal=The Scientist|date=August 20, 1990|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/11311/title/Lawsuits-Threaten-ACS--Nonprofit-Status--Financial-Health/|accessdate=29 January 2016}}</ref> They also raised the question of whether the CAS, which had received funding from the National Science Foundation, should have the right to restrict its information.<ref name=Peek>{{cite book|last1=Peek|first1=Robin P.|last2=Newby|first2=Gregory B.|title=Scholarly publishing : the electronic frontier|date=1996|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=978-0262161572|pages=289–290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uj-LIewe3TUC&pg=PA289|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> The ACS countersued, asserting that Dialog had not been paying its bills.<ref name=Shivley>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/cen-v085n021.p041| last = Shivley| first = Eric| title = CAS Surveys Its First 100 Years| journal = Chemical & Engineering News| volume = 85| issue = 24| pages = 41–53| publisher = American Chemical Society| date = June 11, 2007| url = http://cen.acs.org/articles/85/i24/CAS-Surveys-First-100-Years.html| issn = 0009-2347| accessdate= June 12, 2010}}</ref><ref name="O'Leary">{{cite journal|last1=O'Leary|first1=Mick|title=Dialog and the American Chemical Society Play a High Stakes Game|journal=Online|date=January 1991|volume=15|issue=1|pages=15–20|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-9223458/dialog-and-the-american-chemical-society-play-a-high|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=Seltzer>{{cite journal|last1=Seltzer|first1=Richard|title=ACS files countersuit, answers Dialog charges|journal=Chemical & Engineering News|date=10 September 1990|volume=68|issue=37|pages=5–6|doi=10.1021/cen-v068n037.p005a|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cen-v068n037.p005a|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> Underlying the lawsuits was increasing competition between Dialog's search services and STN International, a collaboration between CAS, FIZ Karlsruhe (Germany) and Japan Science and Technology Corp. which was also providing online search services. The legal battle went on for several years, until it was resolved out of court in 1993. CAS and STN International retained control of the abstracts.

=== ACS v. Leadscope ===
In 2002, the ACS sued Leadscope, alleging that company founders Paul E. Blower Jr., Glenn J. Myatt and Wayne Johnson, who had left the CAS in 1997 to start Leadscope, Inc. had stolen trade secrets.  The founders filed a countersuit, alleging that Chemical Abstracts had defamed them and engaged in improper interference and unfair competition, claims that were upheld by a Franklin County Common Pleas Court on March 27, 2008. The court awarded $27 million in damages to Leadscope. A fourth claim, that CAS had engaged in deceptive trade practices, was not supported.<ref name=DeMartini>{{cite news|last1=DeMartini|first1=Alayna|title=Chemical Society loses lawsuit Scientists awarded $27 million in trade dispute|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/business/2008/03/28/LEADSCOPE.ART_ART_03-28-08_C12_HF9P1EG.html|accessdate=29 January 2016|work=The Columbus Dispatch|date=March 28, 2008}}</ref>  The case was then appealed by the ACS and taken to an appeals court in Ohio and to the [[Ohio Supreme Court]]. The Ohio Supreme Court upheld Leadscope's counterclaims that the ACS lawsuit was “objectively baseless” and intended to quash competition, but not the defamation claim, stating that although "false public statements" were made, those statements were summaries of allegations being made in court documents. The ACS' actions were strongly criticized.<ref name=Reich>{{cite journal|last1=Reich|first1=Eugenie Samuel|title=Chemical society tried to block business competitor|journal=Nature|date=26 September 2012|url=http://www.nature.com/news/chemical-society-tried-to-block-business-competitor-1.11470|accessdate=29 January 2016}}</ref>

=== Open access===

====PubChem database ====
In 2005, the ACS was criticized for opposing the creation of [[PubChem]], which is an [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] [[chemical database]] maintained by the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]]. The ACS raised concerns that the publicly supported PubChem database would directly compete with their existing [[Chemical Abstracts Service]].<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Kaiser| first = Jocelyn| title = Chemists Want NIH to Curtail  Database| journal = Science| volume = 308| issue = 5723| page = 774| date = May 6, 2005| url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/308/5723/774a| issn = 0036-8075| pmid = 15879180| doi = 10.1126/science.308.5723.774a| accessdate = June 12, 2010}}</ref> In a May 23, 2005, press release, the ACS stated:

Madeleine Jacobs reflected at the end of her term as executive director (2003-February 2015) that in 1995, preparing to introduce their first electronic journals, ACS leaders did not realize that they were entering a period of radical change. "None of us really saw the potential of the online journal, how it would revolutionize the way scientists did research".<ref name=Baum>{{cite journal|last1=Baum|first1=Rudy M.|title=Madeleine Jacobs Reflects Retiring ACS executive director and CEO looks back on 24-year career at the society|journal=Chemical & Engineering News|date=December 8, 2014|volume=92|issue=49|pages=43–44|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i49/Madeleine-Jacobs-Reflects.html|accessdate=29 January 2016}}</ref>

The ACS has generally opposed legislation that would mandate free web access to scientific journals. It argues that charging for journal access is often necessary to cover the costs of peer review and publishing, and that open access lacks a "sustainable financial business model".<ref name=Ochs>Ochs, John P. [https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/scholarly-pubs-%28%23277%29%20acs.pdf ''ACS Submission to the Office of Science and Technology Policy Request for Information on Public Access Policies''], January 12, 2012</ref>

ACS journals are experimenting with an author supported open access option, ''ACS AuthorChoice'', in which authors can pay a fee to enable free web access to their articles.<ref name=OpenAuthor>{{cite web|title=American Chemical Society extends new open access program designed to assist authors|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2013/october/acs-extends-new-open-access-program-designed-to-assist-authors.html|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref>

As of 2014, the ACS announced publication of the first fully open access journal in the society's history, ''ACS Central Science'', to be edited by [[Carolyn Bertozzi]].<ref name=Bertozzi/> The full text of all articles in the journal will be made freely available to the public. Bertozzi has stated:

{{quote|“My goal is to make ''ACS Central Science'' a highly selective journal and the primary venue for reporting the most important advances in chemistry and in allied fields where chemical approaches play a major role... Now is the time for innovative publishing strategies that focus and elevate the visibility of chemistry as ‘the central science.’”<ref name=Bertozzi>{{cite web|title=ACS Central Science names Carolyn Bertozzi as its founding editor-in-chief|url=http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/newsreleases/2014/september/acs-central-science-names-carolyn-bertozzi-as-its-founding-editor-in-chief.html|website=American Chemical Society|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}</ref>}}

=== Executive compensation ===
The American Chemical Society has been publicly criticized for the level of compensation paid to some of its executives.<ref name=Letter/><ref name=Jacobson/><ref name=Brumfiel/> The salaries of the ACS executives (executive director, treasurer, and secretary) are decided by the Standing Committee on Executive Compensation which is composed of the "president, the immediate past president, the chair of the society committee on budget and finance, and two members of the society with demonstrated expertise in senior and executive staff compensation."<ref>{{cite web| title = Constitution, Bylaws, and Regulations of the American Chemical Society| publisher = American Chemical Society| year = 2009| url = http://portal.acs.org/portal/fileFetch/C/WPCP_008231/pdf/WPCP_008231.pdf| accessdate = June 12, 2010}}</ref>

After the ACS made compensation data for its top executives available in 2004, a group of prominent academic scientists published a letter in [[Chemical & Engineering News]] expressing their concerns.<ref name=Letter>{{cite journal|title=Executive compensation and transparency|journal=Chemical & Engineering News|date=August 9, 2004|volume=82|issue=32|pages=4–5|url=http://reedgrouplab.ucr.edu/documents/Executive%20Compensation%20and%20Transparency.htm|accessdate=29 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=Jacobson/><ref name=Brumfiel>{{cite journal|last1=Brumfiel|first1=Geoff|title=Director's salary makes chemists see red|journal=Nature|date=26 August 2004|volume=430|issue=7003|pages=957–957|doi=10.1038/430957a|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v430/n7003/full/430957a.html|accessdate=29 January 2016}}</ref>  Particularly criticized was executive director John Crum's total compensation, from salary, expenses and bonuses, which for 2002 was reported to be $767,834.<ref name=Jacobson>{{cite news|last1=Jacobson|first1=Jennifer|title=Chemical Society Draws Fire for Leader's High Pay|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=September 3, 2004}}</ref><ref name=Ryan>{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Mary|title=Scholarly Publishing Update|journal=UAMS Library News|date=September–October 2004|issue=121|url=http://library.uams.edu/assets/newsletter/lnl04/sept_oct/schpub.htm|accessdate=28 January 2016}}</ref> When Madeleine Jacobs became executive director of the ACS, the position came with the use of two Cadillac cars and a chauffeur acquired by her predecessor.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1126/science.305.5689.1399b| title = Judicious spender| journal = Science| volume = 305| issue = 5689| page = 1399| date = September 3, 2004| url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/305/5689/1399b| issn = 0036-8075| accessdate = June 12, 2010}}</ref> Jacobs later auctioned off the cars and let go the chauffeur.
