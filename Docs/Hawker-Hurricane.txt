The '''Hawker Hurricane''' is a British single-seat [[fighter aircraft]] of the 1930s-1940s that was designed and predominantly built by [[Hawker Aircraft]] Ltd for the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). Although overshadowed by the [[Supermarine Spitfire]], the aircraft became renowned during the [[Battle of Britain]], accounting for 60% of the RAF's air victories in the battle, and served in all the major theatres of the [[World War II|Second World War]].

The 1930s design evolved through several versions and adaptations, resulting in a series of aircraft which acted as fighters, bomber-interceptors, fighter-bombers (also called "Hurribombers") and [[Close air support|ground support]] aircraft. Further versions known as the '''Sea&nbsp;Hurricane''' had modifications which enabled operation from ships. Some were converted as catapult-launched convoy escorts, known as "Hurricats".  More than 14,583 Hurricanes were built by the end of 1944 (including at least 800 converted to Sea Hurricanes<ref name="Thetford 1994, p. 232">Thetford 1994, p. 232.</ref><!--page ref may be wrong since I have 1982 edition--> and some 1,400 built in Canada by [[Canadian Car and Foundry]]).

==Design and development==

[[File:Hawker Hurricane before maiden flight 1935.jpg|thumb|''K5083'', the prototype, photographed before its first flight in November 1935.]]

===Origins===
At the time that the Hurricane was developed, [[RAF Fighter Command]] consisted of just 13 squadrons, each equipped with either the [[Hawker Fury]], [[Hawker Hart#Demon|Hawker Demon]], or the [[Bristol Bulldog]], all [[biplane]]s with fixed-[[Blade pitch|pitch]] wooden propellers and non-retractable undercarriages.<ref name="Bader">Bader 2004, p. 36.</ref>  [[Sydney Camm]]'s design to meet F.7/30, the [[Hawker P.V.3]], was essentially a scaled-up version of the Fury<ref>Mason 1992, p. 242.</ref> and was not among the proposals submitted to the Air Ministry selected for building as a government sponsored prototype. After the rejection of the P.V.3, Camm started work on a cantilever monoplane with a fixed undercarriage armed with four machine guns and powered by the [[Rolls-Royce Goshawk]].  Detail drawings were finished by January 1934, but failed to impress the Air Ministry enough for a prototype to be ordered.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 30.</ref>  Camm's response was to further develop the design, introducing a retractable undercarriage and replacing the unsatisfactory Goshawk with a new Rolls-Royce design, the PV-12, later to become famous as the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]].
In August 1934, a one-tenth scale model was made and sent to the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] at [[Teddington]].  A series of wind tunnel tests confirmed the aerodynamic qualities of the design were in order, and in September Camm approached the Air Ministry again.  This time, the response was favourable, and a prototype of the "Interceptor Monoplane" was ordered.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 34.</ref>
In November 1934, the Air Ministry issued Specification F.5/34 which, drawing on the work of Squadron Leader [[Ralph Sorley]], called for fighter aircraft to be armed with eight guns. However, by this time, work had progressed too far to immediately modify the planned four-gun installation. By January 1935, a wooden mock-up had been finished, and although a number of suggestions for detail changes were made, construction of the prototype was approved, and a new specification (F.36/34) was written around the design. In July 1935, this specification was amended to include installation of eight guns.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 40.</ref>

Work on the airframe was completed at the end of August 1935 and the aircraft components were taken to [[Brooklands]], where Hawker had an assembly shed, and re-assembled on 23 October 1935. Ground testing and taxi trials took place over the following two weeks. On 6 November 1935, the prototype ''K5083'' took to the air for the first time at the hands of Hawker's chief [[test pilot]], [[Flight Lieutenant]] (later [[Group Captain]]) [[George Bulman (pilot)|George Bulman]].<ref name=greatac>Cacutt 1989, pp. 204–212.</ref>  Bulman was assisted by two other pilots in subsequent flight testing; [[Philip Lucas]] flew some of the experimental test flights, while [[John Stuart Hindmarsh|John Hindmarsh]] conducted the firm's production flight trials.<ref>Bader 2004, pp. 37, 40.</ref>

The same year the Hawker [[Board of Directors]] voted to tool-up for and build a production line at company expense for 1,000 Hurricanes .<ref>"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines - 5th edition" by [[Bill Gunston]], Sutton Publishing, 2006, p.188</ref>

RAF trials of the aircraft at [[RAF Martlesham Heath|Martlesham Heath]] began in February 1936.  Sammy Wroath, later to be the founding Commandant of the Empire Test Pilot School, was the RAF test pilot for the Hurricane: his report was favorable, stating, "The aircraft is simple and easy to fly and has no apparent vices" and going on to praise its control response.<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 52.</ref>   The type name "Hurricane" proposed by Hawker was approved by the Air Ministry on 26 June; an informal christening ceremony was carried out the next month when [[King Edward VIII]] paid a visit to Martlesham Heath.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1936/1936%20-%201976.html The King Inspects his Air Force] [[Flight International|''Flight'']], 16 July 1936.</ref>

Further testing showed that the Hurricane had poor [[spin (flight)|spin]] recovery characteristics, with all rudder authority being lost. Hawker's response was to request that spinning tests be waived, but the Air Ministry refused the request;<ref>McKinstry 2010, p. 64.</ref> the situation was resolved by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]], who established that the problem was caused by a breakdown of the airflow over the lower fuselage, and could be cured by the addition of a small ventral fairing and extension of the bottom of the rudder. This discovery came too late to be incorporated in the first production aircraft, but was introduced in the 61st built and all subsequent aircraft.<ref>Mason 1992, p. 254.</ref>

===Design===
[[File:Royal Air Force 1939-1945- Fighter Command C460.jpg|thumb|right|Mk I in France, November 1939, showing original fabric-covered outer wing and two-bladed propeller]]
[[File:hurricane in planform arp.jpg|thumb|Underside view of ''R4118'', a preserved Hurricane from the [[Battle of Britain]]]]

Though faster and more advanced than the RAF's current front line biplane fighters, the Hurricane's constructional design was already outdated when introduced. It used the traditional Hawker construction techniques, with a [[Truss bridge#Warren truss|Warren truss]] box-girder primary fuselage structure with high-tensile steel [[longerons]] and [[duralumin]] cross-bracing using mechanically fastened rather than welded joints. Over this, wooden [[former]]s and [[stringer (aircraft)|stringers]] carried the [[aircraft dope|doped]] [[linen]] covering.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1938/1938%20-%201333.html "The 'Hurricane' Unveiled."] [[Flight International|''Flight'']], 12 May 1938.</ref>
Initially, the wing structure consisted of two steel spars, and was also fabric-covered. An all-metal, stressed-skin wing of [[duralumin]]ium (a DERD specification similar to AA2024) was introduced in April 1939 and was used for all of the later marks.<ref name=greatac /> "The metal skinned wings allowed a diving speed that was {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} higher than the fabric-covered ones. They were very different in construction but were interchangeable with the fabric-covered wings; one trials Hurricane, ''L1877'', was even flown with a fabric-covered port wing and metal-covered starboard wing. The great advantage of the metal-covered wings over the fabric ones was that the metal ones could carry far greater stress loads without needing so much structure beneath."<ref name="Hiscock p. 12">Hiscock 2003, p. 12.</ref>
Several fabric-wing Hurricanes were still in service during the Battle of Britain, although a good number had had their wings replaced during servicing or after repair. Changing the wings only required three hours work per aircraft.<ref name="Hiscock p. 12"/>

The prototype and early production Hurricanes were fitted with a Watts two-bladed fixed-pitch wooden propeller. Since this was inefficient at low airspeeds, the aircraft required a long ground run to get airborne, causing concern at Fighter Command. Trials with a [[De Havilland]] [[variable-pitch propeller]] reduced the take-off run from {{convert|1230|to|750|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Deliveries of these began in April 1939: this was later replaced by the hydraulically operated constant-speed [[Rotol]] propeller, which came into service in time for the Battle of Britain.<ref>McKnstry 2010, p. 87.</ref>

{{quote box|align=left|quote=Then, with tail trimmer set, throttle and mixture lever fully forward... and puffs of grey exhaust smoke soon clearing at maximum r.p.m. came the surprise! There was no sudden surge of acceleration, but with a thunderous roar from the exhausts just ahead on either side of the windscreen, only a steady increase in speed... In retrospect that first Hurricane sortie was a moment of elation, but also of relief. Apart from the new scale of speeds that the pilot had to adapt to, the Hurricane had all the qualities of its stable, secure biplane predecessor the [[Hawker Hart|Hart]], but enhanced by livelier controls, greater precision and all this performance.|source=<small>[[Roland Beamont]], a trainee pilot, describing his first flight in a Hurricane.<ref>Beamont January 1994, pp. 17, 18.</ref></small>|width=26%}}
One of Camm's priorities was to provide the pilot with good all-round visibility. To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive "hump-backed" silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable "[[stirrup]]" mounted below the trailing edge of the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the footstep retracted into the fuselage. In addition, both [[wing root]]s were coated with strips of non-slip material.

An advantage of the steel-tube structure was that cannon shells could pass right through the wood and fabric covering without exploding. Even if one of the steel tubes were damaged, the repair work required was relatively simple and could be done by groundcrew at the airfield. Damage to a [[stressed skin]] structure, as used by the Spitfire, required more specialised equipment to repair.<ref>[http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/spits_and_canes.html "Best of Battle of Britain."] ''[[Air & Space]],'' February–March 2008, p. 4.</ref> The old-fashioned structure also permitted the assembly of Hurricanes with relatively basic equipment under field conditions. Crated Hurricanes were assembled at [[Sekondi-Takoradi|Takoradi]] in West Africa and flown across the Sahara to the Middle East theatre and, to save space, some [[Royal Navy]] aircraft carriers carried their reserve Sea Hurricanes dismantled into their major assemblies, which were slung up on the hangar bulkheads and deckhead for reassembly when needed.

In contrast, the contemporary Spitfire used all-metal [[monocoque]] construction and was thus both lighter and stronger, though less tolerant to bullet damage. With its ease of maintenance, widely set landing gear and benign flying characteristics, the Hurricane remained in use in theatres of operations where reliability, easy handling and a stable gun platform were more important than performance, typically in roles like ground attack. One of the design requirements of the original specification was that both the Hurricane and the Spitfire were also to be used as a [[night fighter]]. The Hurricane proved to be a relatively simple aircraft to fly at night and was to be instrumental in shooting down several German aircraft during the nocturnal hours. From early 1941, the Hurricane would also be used as an "intruder" aircraft, patrolling German airfields in France at night in an attempt to catch night bombers during takeoffs or landings.

===Production===
[[File:Women assembling Hawker Hurricanes 1942.jpg|thumbnail|Hurricane production line, 1942]]
The Hurricane was ordered into production in June 1936, mainly due to its relatively simple construction and ease of manufacture. As war was looking increasingly likely, and time was of the essence in providing the RAF with an effective fighter aircraft, it was unclear if the more advanced Spitfire would enter production smoothly, while the Hurricane used well-understood manufacturing techniques. This was true for service squadrons as well, which were experienced in working on and repairing aircraft whose construction employed the same principles as the Hurricane, and the simplicity of its design enabled the improvisation of some remarkable repairs in squadron workshops. The Hurricane was also significantly cheaper than the Spitfire, requiring 10,300 man hours to produce versus 15,200 for the Spitfire.<ref>Postan 1952, p. Chapter IV, footnote 89.</ref>

The maiden flight of the first production aircraft, powered by a Merlin II engine, took place on 12 October 1937. The first four aircraft to enter service with the RAF joined [[No. 111 Squadron RAF]] at [[RAF Northolt]] the following December. By the outbreak of the Second World War, nearly 500 Hurricanes had been produced, and had equipped 18 squadrons.<ref>Bader 2004, p. 41.</ref>

During 1940, [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], who was the [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], established an organisation in which a number of manufacturers were seconded to repair and overhaul battle-damaged Hurricanes. The [[Civilian Repair Organisation]] also overhauled battle-weary aircraft, which were later sent to training units or to other air forces; one of the factories involved was the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin Aero Company]]'s [[Cofton Hackett#Austin Aero Works|Cofton Hackett plant]]. Another was David Rosenfield Ltd, based at [[Barton-upon-Irwell|Barton]] aerodrome near [[Manchester]].

Some 14,000 Hurricanes and Sea Hurricanes were produced.<ref name="Thetford 1994, p. 232"/><!--page ref may be wrong since I have 1982 edition-->{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=It would be nice to know how many fighters versus fighter-bombers versus other variants. It is not provided in variants section either. None-the-less, we are told a great deal}} Most Hurricanes were built by Hawker (which produced them until 1944), with Hawker's sister company, the [[Gloster Aircraft Company]], making 2,750. The Austin Aero Company built 300. [[Canada Car and Foundry]] in [[Fort William, Ontario]], Canada, (where the Chief Engineer, [[Elsie MacGill]], became known as the "Queen of the Hurricanes") was responsible for production of 1,400 Hurricanes, known as the Mk X. <!--According to other authors, Canadian Car and Foundry went on to produce 1,451 Hurricanes in several marks. --need the source here--->

In 1939, production of 100 Hurricanes was initiated in [[Yugoslavia]] by [[Zmaj aircraft|Zmaj]] and [[Rogožarski]]. Of these, 20 were built by Zmaj by April 1941. One of these was fitted with a [[Daimler-Benz DB 601|DB 601]] and [[flight test|test flown]] in 1941.

A contract for 80 Hurricanes was placed with Fairey's Belgian subsidiary [[Avions Fairey|Avions Fairey SA]] for the [[Belgian Air Force]] in 1938, with the intention of arming these aircraft with four 13.2&nbsp;mm machine guns. Three were built and two flown with this armament by the time of the ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' in May 1940, with at least 12 more built by Avions Fairey with the conventional eight rifle calibre machine gun armament.<ref name="Half pt 4 p34">''Air International'', July 1987, p. 34.</ref>

==Operational history==
The first 50 Hurricanes had reached squadrons by the middle of 1938. At that time, production was slightly greater than the RAF's capacity to introduce the new aircraft and the government gave Hawker the clearance to sell the excess to nations likely to oppose German expansion. As a result, there were some modest sales to other countries. Production was then increased with a plan to create a reserve of aircraft as well as re-equip existing squadrons and newly formed ones such as those of the Auxiliary Air Force. Expansion scheme E included a target of 500 fighters of all types by the start of 1938. By the time of the [[Munich Crisis]], there were only two fully operational squadrons of the planned 12 with Hurricanes.<ref>Shacklady 2000, pp. 47–49.</ref>
By the time of the [[German invasion of Poland]], there were 18 operational Hurricane squadrons and three more converting.

===The Phoney War===
The Hurricane had its baptism of fire on 21 October 1939, at the start of the [[Phoney War]]. That day, “A” Flight of [[No. 46 Squadron RAF|46 Squadron]] took off from North Coates satellite airfield, on the [[Lincolnshire]] coast, and was directed to intercept a formation of nine [[Heinkel He 115]]B floatplanes from 1/KüFlGr 906, searching for ships to attack in the North Sea. The Heinkels had already been attacked and damaged by two Spitfires from [[No. 72 Squadron RAF|72 Squadron]] when six Hurricanes intercepted the Heinkels, which were flying at sea level in an attempt to avoid fighter attacks. Nevertheless, the Hurricanes, in rapid succession, shot down four of the enemy (46 Squadron claiming five and the Spitfire pilots two).<ref name="Holmes p. 12.">Holmes 1999, p. 12.</ref>

In response to a request from the French government for 10 fighter squadrons to provide air support, Air Chief Marshal [[Hugh Dowding, 1st Baron Dowding|Sir Hugh Dowding]], Commander-in-Chief of RAF Fighter Command, insisted that this number would deplete British defences severely, and so initially only four squadrons of Hurricanes, [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|1]], [[No. 73 Squadron RAF|73]], [[No. 85 Squadron RAF|85]] and [[No. 87 Squadron RAF|87]], were relocated to France, keeping Spitfires back for "Home" defence. The first to arrive was No.73 Squadron on 10 September 1939, followed shortly by the other three. A little later, [[No. 607 Squadron RAF|607]] and [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|615 Squadrons]] joined them.

After his first flight in October 1939, Hurricane pilot [[Roland Beamont]] subsequently flew operationally with 87 Squadron, claiming three enemy aircraft during the French campaign, and delivered great praise for his aircraft's performance:
{{Cquote|Throughout the bad days of 1940, 87 Sqn had maintained a proficient formation aerobatic team, the precise flying controls and responsive engines permitting precision formation through loops, barrel rolls, 1g semi-stall turns and rolls off half-loops ... My Hurricane was never hit in the Battles of France and Britain, and in over 700 hr on type I never experienced an engine failure.|20px|20px|Roland Beamont, summarising his wartime experience as a pilot.<ref>Beamont January 1994, p. 19.</ref>}}

On 30 October, Hurricanes saw action over France. That day, Pilot Officer P.W.O. “Boy” Mould of 1st Squadron, flying Hurricane L1842, shot down a [[Dornier Do 17]]P from 2(F)/123. The German aircraft, sent to photograph Allied airfields close to the border, fell in flames about {{convert|10|mi|km}} west of [[Toul]]. Mould was the first RAF pilot to down an enemy aircraft on the continent in the Second World War.<ref name="Holmes pp. 15–16.">Holmes 1999, pp. 15–16.</ref>{{refn|Mould was shot down on 1 October 1941 by Italian [[Macchi MC.202]]s north of [[Malta]] and declared "[[missing in action]]".|group=N}}

On 6 November 1939, Pilot Officer [[Peter Ayerst|P.V. Ayerst]] from 73 Squadron, was the first to clash with a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]. After the dogfight, he came back with five holes in his fuselage.<ref name="Holmes p. 18.">Holmes 1999, p. 18.</ref> [[Flying Officer]] [[Cobber Kain|E. J. "Cobber" Kain]], a New Zealander, was responsible for 73 Squadron's first victory on 8 November 1939 while stationed at [[Étain-Rouvres Air Base|Rouvres]].<ref>Burns 1992, pp. 56–57.</ref> He went on to become one of the RAF's first fighter [[Flying ace|aces]] of the war, being credited with 16 kills.

On 22 December, the Hurricanes in France suffered their first losses. Three Hawker fighters, while trying to intercept an unidentified aircraft, between [[Metz]] and [[Thionville]], were jumped by four Bf 109Es from III./JG 53, with the ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'', [[Spanish Civil War]] ace Captain [[Werner Mölders]] in the lead. Mölders and ''Leutnant'' [[Hans von Hahn]] shot down the Hurricanes of Sergeant R.M. Perry and J. Winn for no loss.<ref name="Holmes p. 18." />

===Battle of France===
[[File:C 001234Hurricane1Sqn1940.jpg|thumb|right|Hurricane I of [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|1 Sqn]] being refuelled at Vassincourt.]]
In May 1940, Nos. 3, 79 and 504 Squadrons reinforced the earlier units as Germany's ''[[Blitzkrieg]]'' gathered momentum. On 10 May, the first day of the [[Battle of France]], Flight Lieutenant R. E. Lovett and Flying Officer "Fanny" Orton, of 73 Squadron, were the first R.A.F pilots to engage enemy aircraft in the campaign. They attacked one of the three [[Dornier Do 17]]s from ''4. Staffel/[[Kampfgeschwader 2|KG 2]]'' that were flying over their airfield at [[Étain-Rouvres Air Base|Rouvres-en-Woevre]]. The Dornier went away unscathed, while Orton was hit by defensive fire and had to force land.<ref name="Holmes p. 24.">Holmes 1996, p. 24.</ref>  On the same day, the Hurricane squadrons claimed 42 German aircraft shot down during 208 sorties, although none of these were fighters, while seven Hurricanes were lost but no pilots were killed.<ref name="Holmes p. 24." />

On 12 May, several Hurricanes units were committed to escort bombers. That morning, five [[Fairey Battle]] volunteer crews from 12 Squadron took off from [[Amifontaine]] base to bomb Vroenhoven and Veldwezelt bridges on the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]], at [[Maastricht]]. The escort consisted of eight Hurricanes of 1 Squadron, with Squadron Leader P. J. H. "Bull" Halahan in the lead. When the formation approached Maastricht, it was bounced by 16 Bf 109Es from ''2./JG 27''. Two Battles and two Hurricanes (including Halahan's) were shot down, two more Battles were brought down by flak and the fifth bomber was forced to crash land. The 1 Squadron pilots claimed four Messerschmitts and two [[Heinkel He 112]]s,{{refn|The Heinkel He 112 was never operational in France.|group=N}} while the [[Luftwaffe]] actually lost only one Bf 109.<ref name="Holmes pp. 41-42.">Holmes 1996, pp. 41-42.</ref><ref name=group>Two of the crew of the leading Battle, [[Donald Garland]] and [[Thomas Gray (VC)|Thomas Gray]] were awarded the Victoria Cross for pressing home the attack</ref>

On 13 May 1940, a further 32 Hurricanes arrived. All ten requested Hurricane squadrons were then operating from French soil and felt the full force of the Nazi offensive. The following day, Hurricanes suffered heavy losses: 27 being shot down, 22 by Messerschmitts, with 15 pilots killed (another died some days later), including Squadron Leader J. B. Parnall (504 Sqn),{{refn|J. B. Parnall was the first RAF flight commander to be killed in action during the war.|group=N}} and the Australian ace [[Flying Officer]] [[Les Clisby]] (1 Sqn).<ref name="Holmes p. 47.">Holmes 1996, p. 47.</ref>{{refn|Australian ace [[Les Clisby]] was credited with 16 individual air victories, one shared and one not confirmed. Postwar research reduced his score to nine individual kills and three shared.

By 17 May, the end of the first week of fighting, only three of the squadrons were near operational strength, but despite their heavy losses, the Hurricanes had managed to destroy nearly double the number of German aircraft.<ref>Shores, Christopher. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/1_squadron_gallery_01.shtml "France, 1940: 1 Squadron."] ''BBC,'' 8 September 2010. Retrieved: 29 September 2010.</ref>
On 18 May 1940, air combat continued from dawn to dusk; Hurricanes pilots claimed 57 German aircraft and 20 probables (Luftwaffe records show 39 aircraft lost). The following day, 1 and 73 Squadrons claimed 11 German aircraft (three by "Cobber" Kain and three by Paul Richey). But in these two days, Hurricanes suffered heavier losses, with 68 Hurricanes shot down or forced to crash land due to combat damage. Fifteen pilots were killed, eight were taken prisoner and 11 injured. Two thirds of the Hurricanes had been shot down by Messerschmitt Bf 109s and [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110s]].<ref name="Holmes pp. 51.">Holmes 1996, p. 51.</ref>

In the afternoon of 20 May 1940, the Hurricane units based in northern France were ordered to abandon their bases on the continent and return to Great Britain. On the same day, "Bull" Halahan requested the repatriation of the pilots serving in 1 Squadron. During the previous 10 days, the unit had been the most successful of the campaign; it had claimed 63 victories for the loss of five pilots: two killed, one taken prisoner and two hospitalised. 1 Squadron was  awarded ten DFCs and three DFMs during the ''Blitzkrieg''.<ref name="Holmes p. 52.">Holmes 1996, p. 52.</ref> On the evening of 21 May, the only Hurricanes still operative were those of the [[RAF Advanced Air Striking Force|AASF]] that had been moved to bases around [[Troyes]].<ref name="Holmes p. 55.">Holmes 1996, p. 55.</ref>

During the 11 days of fighting in France and over Dunkirk from 10–21 May, Hurricane pilots claimed 499 kills and 123 probables. Contemporary German records, examined postwar, attribute 299 Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed and 65 seriously damaged by RAF fighters.<ref>Holmes 1998, p. 47.</ref> The last 66 Hurricanes of the 452 engaged during the Battle of France left France on 21 June and 178 were abandoned at several airfields, notably [[Merville, Nord|Merville]], [[Abbeville]], and [[Lille]]/[[Seclin]].<ref name="Holmes p. 55." /><ref name="Holmes p. 23.">Holmes 1996, p. 23.</ref>

===Operation Dynamo===
During  [[Dunkirk evacuation|Operation Dynamo]] (the evacuation from Dunkirk of British, French and Belgian troops cut off by the German army during the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]), the Hawker Hurricanes operated from British bases. Between 26 May and 3 June 1940, the 14 Hurricane units involved were credited with 108 air victories. A total of 27 Hurricane pilots became aces during Operation Dynamo, led by Canadians, Pilot Officer W. L. [[Willie McKnight]] (10 victories) and Pilot Officer [[Percival Stanley Turner]] (seven victories), who served in No. 242 Squadron, consisting mostly of Canadian personnel.<ref name = "Holmes p.58">Holmes 1996, p. 58.</ref> Losses were 22 pilots killed and three captured.<ref name="Holmes p.57">Holmes 1996, p. 57.</ref>

On 27 May 1940, in one of the final mass encounters of the ''Blitzkrieg'', 13 Hurricanes from 501 Squadron intercepted 24 [[Heinkel He 111]]s escorted by 20 Bf 110s; during the ensuing battle, 11 Heinkels were claimed as "kills" and others damaged, with little damage to the Hurricanes.<ref>Bader 2004, pp. 50–55.</ref>

{{quote|"Over Dunkirk, the Luftwaffe suffered its first serious rebuff of the war. As Galland has noted, the nature and style of the air battles over the beaches should have provided a warning as to the inherent weaknesses of the Luftwaffe's force structure. Admittedly, the Germans fought at a disadvantage. Although positioned forward at captured airfields, the Bf 109 was at the outer limits of its range and possessed less flying time over Dunkirk than did the "Hurricanes" and "Spitfires" operating from southern England. German bombers were still located in western Germany and had even farther to fly. Thus, the Luftwaffe could not bring its full weight to bear so that when its bombers hammered those on the beaches or embarking, the RAF intervened in a significant fashion. German aircraft losses were high, and British fighter attacks often prevented German bombers from performing with full effectiveness. Both sides suffered heavy losses. During the nine days from May 26 through June 3, the RAF lost 177 aircraft destroyed or damaged; the Germans lost 240. For much of the Luftwaffe, Dunkirk came as a nasty shock. Fliegerkorps II reported in its war diary that it lost more aircraft on the 27th attacking the evacuation than it had lost in the previous ten days of the campaign."<ref>Murray 2002, pp. 38–39.</ref>|}}

On 7 June 1940, "Cobber" Kain, the first RAF ace of the war, got word that he was to return to England for "rest leave" at an [[Operational Training Unit]]. On leaving his airfield, he put on an impromptu aerobatic display and was killed when his Hurricane crashed after completing a [[Aerobatic maneuver|loop]] and attempting some low altitude [[Aerobatic maneuver|"flick" rolls]].<ref>Burns 1992, pp. 165–167.</ref>

Initial engagements with the Luftwaffe had showed the Hurricane to be a tight-turning and steady platform, but the Watts two-bladed propeller was clearly unsuitable. At least one pilot complained of how a Heinkel 111 was able to pull away from him in a chase, yet by this time the Heinkel was obsolete.<ref name = "Hiscock p. 12"/>  At the start of the war, the engine ran on standard 87 [[octane]] [[avgas|aviation spirit]].

"Overboost" or "pulling the plug", a form of [[war emergency power]] as it was called in later Second World War aircraft, was an important wartime modification that allowed the Hurricane to be more competitive against the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109E]] and to increase its margin of superiority over the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110C]], especially at low altitude.

[[Flight Lieutenant|Flt Lt]] Ian Gleed of 87 Squadron wrote about the effect of using the extra boost on the Hurricane while chasing a Bf 109 at low altitude on 19 May 1940:

Hurricanes equipped with [[Dowty Rotol|Rotol]] constant-speed propellers were delivered to RAF squadrons in May 1940, with deliveries continuing throughout the Battle of Britain; the Rotol propeller transformed the Hurricane's performance from "disappointing" to one of "acceptable mediocrity" and modified aircraft were certainly much sought after among squadrons equipped with aircraft having the older de Havilland two-position propeller.<ref>Donald 1999, p. 38.</ref>

===Battle of Britain===
[[File:Hurricane I 1 Sqn RAF at RAF Wittering 1940.jpg|thumb|Hurricane I of [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|1 Sqn.]] flown by Plt Off A.V. Clowes.]]
At the end of June 1940, following the fall of France, the majority of the RAF's 36 fighter squadrons were equipped with Hurricanes. The [[Battle of Britain]] officially lasted from 10 July until 31 October 1940, but the heaviest fighting took place between 8 August and 21 September. Both the Supermarine Spitfire and the Hurricane are renowned for their part in defending Britain against the Luftwaffe; generally, the Spitfire would intercept the German fighters, leaving Hurricanes to concentrate on the bombers, but despite the undoubted abilities of the "thoroughbred" Spitfire, it was the "workhorse" Hurricane that scored the higher number of RAF victories during this period, accounting for 55 percent of the 2,739 German losses, according to Fighter Command, compared with 42 per cent by Spitfires.<ref name="forgotten">Bywater, Michael. [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/our-forgotten-freedom-fighter-why-the-unsung-hurricane-is-the-true-ace-of-the-battle-of-britain-2022105.html "Our forgotten freedom fighter: Why the unsung Hurricane is the true ace of the Battle of Britain."] ''The Independent,'' 17 January 2011.</ref>

As a fighter, the Hurricane had some drawbacks. It was slower than both the Spitfire I and II and the Messerschmitt Bf 109E, and the thick wings compromised acceleration, but it could out-turn both of them. In spite of its performance deficiencies against the Bf 109, the Hurricane was still capable of destroying the German fighter, especially at lower altitudes. The standard tactic of the 109s was to attempt to climb higher than the RAF fighters and "bounce" them in a dive; the Hurricanes could evade such tactics by turning into the attack or going into a "corkscrew dive", which the 109s, with their lower rate of roll, found hard to counter. If a 109 was caught in a dogfight, the Hurricane was just as capable of out-turning the 109 as the Spitfire. In a stern chase, the 109 could easily evade the Hurricane.<ref>Bungay 2000, pp. 264–267.</ref>

In September 1940, the more powerful Mk IIa series 1 Hurricanes started entering service, although only in small numbers.<ref>Ramsay 1989, pp. 415, 516, 526, 796.</ref> This version was capable of a maximum speed of {{convert|342|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Mason 1991, pp. 279, 300.</ref>

The Hurricane was a steady gun platform,<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 82.</ref> and had demonstrated its ruggedness, as several were badly damaged, yet returned to base. But, whilst it was sturdy and stable, the Hurricane's construction made it dangerous in the event of the aircraft catching fire; the wood frames and fabric covering of the rear fuselage meant that fire could spread through the rear fuselage structure quite easily. In addition, the gravity fuel tank in the forward fuselage sat right in front of the instrument panel, without any form of protection for the pilot. Many Hurricane pilots were seriously burned as a consequence of a jet of flame which could burn through the instrument panel. This became of such concern to [[Hugh Dowding]] that he had Hawker retrofit the fuselage tanks of the Hurricanes with a self-expanding rubber coating called Linatex.<ref>http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1945/1945%20-%201890.jpg</ref> If the tank happened to be punctured by a bullet, the linatex coating would expand when soaked with petrol and seal it<ref>Bungay 2000, pp. 77, 197–198..</ref> Some Hurricane pilots also felt that the fuel tanks in the wings, although they were protected with a layer of Linatex, were vulnerable from behind, and it was thought that these, not the fuselage tank, were the main fire risk.<ref>Bungay 2000, p. 198.</ref><ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/FlightPDFArchive/1945/1945%20-%201890.PDF Wilkinson Rubber Linatex advert] September 27th, 1945</ref>

From 10 July to 11 August 1940, RAF fighters fired at 114 German bombers and shot down 80, a destruction ratio of 70%. Against the Bf 109, the RAF fighters attacked 70 and shot down 54 of these, a ratio of 77%. Part of the success of the British fighters was possibly due to the use of the de Wilde [[Incendiary ammunition|incendiary round]].<ref>Bungay 2000, pp. 200–201.</ref>

The Hurricane with the highest number of Kills during the Battle of Britain was P3308, a Mk1, flown between 15 August and 7 October 1940 by RAF (auxiliary) pilot [[Archie McKellar]] of 605 Squadron.<ref>Holmes, Tony. (1998) Hurricane Aces 1939–1940. Osprey Publishing. London. p. 128 ISBN 978-1-85532-597-5</ref>  He is credited with 21 kills, 19 of those in a Hurricane during the Battle of Britain.  On 7 October he is credited with shooting down 5 Bf 109's, making him one of only 2 RAF pilots (the other [[Brian Carbury]] of New Zealand) to become an Ace in a Day during the Battle of Britain.<ref>Holmes 1998, p. 106</ref><ref>Shores, Christopher and Williams, Clive.

As in the Spitfire, the Merlin engine suffered from negative-G cut-out, a problem not cured until the introduction of [[Miss Shilling's orifice]] in early 1941.

The only Battle of Britain [[Victoria Cross]], and the only one awarded to a member of Fighter Command during the war,<ref>Ramsay 1989, p. 306.</ref> was awarded to Flight Lieutenant [[Eric Nicolson]] of [[No. 249 Squadron RAF|249 Squadron]] as a result of an action on 16 August 1940 when his section of three Hurricanes was "bounced" from above by Bf 110 fighters. All three were hit simultaneously. Nicolson was badly wounded, and his Hurricane was damaged and engulfed in flames. While attempting to leave the cockpit, Nicolson noticed that one of the Bf 110s had overshot his aircraft. He returned to the cockpit, which by now was an inferno, engaged the enemy, and may have shot down the Bf 110.<ref>Ramsay 1989, pp. 306–313, 362.</ref>{{refn| As far as can be determined, no Messerschmitt Bf 110 crashes on land for 16 August 1940 can be attributed to Nicholson, although Nicholson himself believed the 110 crashed into the sea.<ref>Ramsay 1989, p. 311.</ref>|group=N}}

===Night fighters and Intruders===
[[File:Hurricane IIC 87 Sqn RAF in flight 1942.jpg|thumb|Wartime colour photo of Hurricane IIC ''BE500'' flown by Sqn Ldr [[Denis Smallwood]] of [[No. 87 Squadron RAF|87 Sqn]] in the RDM2 ("Special Night") scheme and used on intruder operations 1941–1942.]]
Following the Battle of Britain, the Hurricane continued to give service and through [[the Blitz]] of 1941, was the principal single-seat night fighter in Fighter Command. F/Lt. Richard Stevens claimed 14 Luftwaffe bombers flying Hurricanes in 1941. In 1942, the cannon-armed Mk IIc performed further afield, as a night intruder over occupied Europe. F/Lt. [[Karel Kuttelwascher]] of [[No. 1 Squadron RAF|1 Squadron]] proved the top scorer, with 15 Luftwaffe bombers claimed shot down.

1942 also saw the manufacture of twelve Hurricane II C(NF) night fighters, equipped with pilot-operated Air Interception Mark VI radar. After a brief operational deployment with No. 245 and [[No. 247 Squadron RAF]] during which these aircraft proved too slow for operations in Europe, the aircraft were sent to India to serve with [[No. 176 Squadron RAF]] in the defence of Calcutta.<ref>Marchant 1996, pp. 53–54.</ref> They were withdrawn from service at the end of December 1943.<ref>Thomas 1996, pp. 550–554.</ref>

===North Africa===
[[File:Maintenance of 274 Sqn RAF Hurricane Gerawala 1941.jpg|thumbnail|Maintenance work being carried out on a Hurricane of 274 Sqdn during the siege of Tobruk]]
The Hurricane Mk II was hastily [[tropical climate|tropicalised]] following [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]]'s entry into the war in June 1940. These aircraft were initially ferried through France by air to [[No. 80 Squadron RAF|80 Squadron]] in Egypt to replace [[Gloster Gladiator|Gladiators]]. The Hurricane claimed its first kill in the Mediterranean on 19 June 1940, when F/O P.G. Wykeham-Barnes reported shooting down two [[Fiat CR.42]]s.
Hurricanes served with several British Commonwealth squadrons in the [[Desert Air Force]].
They suffered heavy losses over North Africa after the arrival of Bf 109E and F-variants and were progressively replaced in the air superiority role from June 1941 by [[Curtiss P-40|Curtiss Tomahawks/Kittyhawks]]. However, fighter-bomber variants ("Hurribombers") retained an edge in the ground attack role, due to their impressive armament of four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon and a {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}} bombload.
From November 1941, beginning in the Libyan desert, it had to face a new formidable opponent: the new [[Regia Aeronautica]] [[Macchi C.202]] ''Folgore''. The Italian aircraft proved superior to the Hawker fighter.<ref name="Glancey p. 165.">Glancey 2006, p. 165.</ref> The C.202, thanks to its excellent agility and a new, [[Daimler-Benz DB 601|more powerful inline engine]] license-built by [[Alfa Romeo]], could outperform it in a dogfight.<ref name="Snedden p. 51.">Snedden 1997, p. 51.</ref>

During and following the five-day [[El Alamein]] artillery barrage that commenced on the night of 23 October 1942, six squadrons of Hurricanes, including the [[Vickers S|40&nbsp;mm cannon]]-armed Hurricane Mk.IID version, claimed to have destroyed 39 tanks, 212 lorries and armoured troop-carriers, 26 [[Bowser (tanker)|bowsers]], 42 guns, 200 various other vehicles and four small fuel and ammunition dumps, flying 842 sorties with the loss of 11 pilots. Whilst performing in a ground support role, Hurricanes based at [[RAF Castel Benito]], [[Tripoli]], knocked out six tanks, 13 armoured vehicles, 10 lorries, five [[half-track]]s, a gun and trailer, and a wireless van on 10 March 1943, with no losses to themselves.<ref>Bader 2004, pp. 165–167.</ref>

In the Spring of 1943 during the German [[Operation Ochsenkopf|Ochsenkopf offensive]] in [[Tunisian Campaign|Tunisia]]; Hurricane MKIID's conducted many sorties after fog had lifted helping to blunt the final attack at Hunts Gap.<ref>{{cite journal|title=War Monthly|date=1974|issue=1-9|page=14|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=waJmAAAAMAAJ&q=hurricane+hunts+gap+1943&dq=hurricane+hunts+gap+1943&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rZ5cVeK4BqPW7AaU_oGIDw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref>

===Defence of Malta===
The Hurricane played a significant role in the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|defence of Malta]]. When Italy entered the war on 10 June 1940, Malta's air defence rested on [[Gloster Gladiator]]s which managed to hold out against vastly superior numbers of the Italian air force during the following 17 days. (According to myth, after the first one was lost, the remaining three were named “Faith, Hope and Charity”; in reality, there were at least six Gladiators.) Four Hurricanes joined them at the end of June, and together they faced attacks throughout July from the 200 enemy aircraft based in [[Sicily]], with the loss of one Gladiator and one Hurricane.<!---completely unnecessary to chronicle individual actions--- On 16 July, Flt Lt Peter Keeble in Hurricane P2623 and Flt Lt Burges in a Gladiator, scrambled to intercept a dozen C.R.42s from ''23° Gruppo''. Keeble attacked one CR.42 but then came under attack himself by the ''Falcos'' of ''Tenente'' Mario Pinna and ''Tenente'' Oscar Abello. Keeble started to dogfight with the biplanes, but he was hit and he dived into the ground near [[Fort Rinella]], perishing, while a CR.42, probably the aircraft that he had shot at, (MM4368), flown by ''Sottotenente'' Mario Benedetti of ''74a Squadrigllia'', crashed 100 yards far, killing his pilot. Keeble was the first pilot to be killed in action at Malta.<ref>Cull and Galea 2008, pp. 64-66, 118.</ref>----> Further reinforcements arrived on 2 August in the form of 12 more Hurricanes and two [[Blackburn Skua]]s.<ref>Shores et al. 1987, pp. 43–47.</ref> {{refn|This was code-named Operation ''Hurry''.

{{quote box|quote=For weeks a handful of Hurricane IIs, aided by Group Captain A.B.

The increasing number of British aircraft on the island, at last, prompted the Italians to employ German [[Junkers Ju 87]] dive bombers to try to destroy the airfields. Finally, in an attempt to overcome the stiff resistance put up by these few aircraft, the Luftwaffe took up base on the Sicilian airfields, only to find that Malta was not an easy target. After numerous attacks on the island over the following months, and the arrival of an extra 23 Hurricanes at the end of April 1941, and a further delivery a month later, the Luftwaffe left Sicily for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian Front]] in June that year.<ref>Bader 2004, pp. 125–127.</ref>

As Malta was situated on the increasingly important sea supply route for the [[North African campaign]], the Luftwaffe returned with a vengeance for a second assault on the island at the beginning of 1942. It wasn't until March, when the onslaught was at its height, that 15 Spitfires flew in off the carrier {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}} to join with the Hurricanes already stationed there and bolster the defence, but many of the new aircraft were lost on the ground and it was again the Hurricane that bore the brunt of the early fighting until further reinforcements arrived.<ref name = "bader 147-155"/>

The Hawker Hurricane was the first Allied [[Lend-Lease]] aircraft to be delivered to the USSR with a total of 2,952 Hurricanes eventually delivered,<ref name="Morgan p. 55.">Morgan 1999, p. 55.</ref> becoming the most numerous British aircraft in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] service.<ref>Yefim 2008, p. 480.</ref> Many Soviet pilots were disappointed by the Hawker fighter, regarding it as inferior to both German and Russian aircraft.<ref name="Morgan p. 55." /><ref name="Drabkin p. 11.">Drabkin 2007, p. 11.</ref>
[[File:No. 151 Wing Royal Air Force Operations in Russia, September-november 1941 CR38.jpg|thumb|250px|Hurricane Mark IIB of No. 81 Squadron RAF at Murmansk-Vaenga airfield, Russia]]

Mk II Hurricanes played an important air defence role in 1941, when the Soviet Union found itself under threat from the German Army approaching on a broad front stretching from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], Moscow, and to the oil fields in the south. Britain's decision to aid the Soviets meant sending supplies by sea to the far northern ports, and as the convoys would need to sail within range of enemy air attack from the Luftwaffe based in neighbouring Finland, it was decided to deliver a number of Hurricane Mk IIBs, flying with [[No. 81 Squadron RAF|Nos. 81]] and [[No. 134 Squadron RAF|134 Squadrons]] of [[No. 151 Wing RAF]], to provide protection. Twenty-four were transported on the [[Aircraft carrier|carrier]] ''[[HMS Argus (I49)|Argus]]'', arriving just off [[Murmansk]] on 28 August 1941, and another 15 crated aircraft on board merchant vessels. In addition to their convoy protection duties, the aircraft also acted as escorts to Russian bombers.

Enemy attention to the area declined in October, at which point the RAF pilots trained their Soviet counterparts to operate the Hurricanes themselves. By the end of the year, the RAF's role had ended, but the aircraft remained behind and became the first of thousands of Allied aircraft that were accepted by the Soviet Union.<ref>Bader 2004, pp. 135–137.</ref>
Although Soviet pilots were not universally enthusiastic about the Hurricane, Hero of the Soviet Union (twice), Lt. Col Boris Safonov "''...&nbsp;loved the Hurricane ...''" and RAF Hurricane Mk IIB fighters operating from Soviet soil in defence of Murmansk, destroyed 15 Luftwaffe aircraft for only one loss in combat.<ref name="Jacobs pp. 84–85">Jacobs 1998, pp. 84–85.</ref> However, in some Soviet war memoirs the Hurricane is described very unflatteringly.<ref>Yefim 2008, p. 482.</ref>

The "Soviet" IIB Hurricane as a multi-role fighter-bomber had quite a few drawbacks. First of all, it was 40–50&nbsp;km/h (25/31&nbsp;mph) slower than its main opponent, the Bf 109E interceptor, at low and medium height, and had a slower rate of climb. The Messerschmitt could outdive the Hurricane because of the thicker wing profile of the British fighter. But the main source of complaints was the Hurricane's armament. Often the eight or 12 small-calibre machine guns did not damage the sturdy and heavily armoured German aircraft; consequently, Soviet ground crews started to remove the Brownings. Retaining only four or six of the 12 machine guns, two 12.7&nbsp;mm [[Berezin UB]]s or two or even four 20&nbsp;mm [[ShVAK cannon]]s were substituted, but overall performance deteriorated.<ref>Yefim 2008, pp. 483–484.</ref>{{refn| Soviet pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov remembered:  "The Hurricane’s engine was powerful, but it couldn’t stand long periods of work at maximum regimes and would quickly break down. The engine worked very clean, it had exhaust stacks and flame suppressors, mounted like mufflers. {{refn|Soviet Hurricanes were fuelled with 95 octane avgas, not the 100 Octane fuel that the Merlin XX was designed to use.|group=N}} This was very comfortable as the flames did not blind the pilot. Our planes were much worse in this respect. But at negative G-forces the engine chocked. There was no compensating tank. This was very bad because we had to execute any manoeuvre with positive G-forces. It had a very thick wing profile and poor acceleration characteristics. It was not slow in responding to the control stick, but everything happened smoothly, slowly. It had good lifting strength and was very good in horizontal manoeuvrability. But the Hurricane was very poor in vertical manoeuvre, due to thick wing profile. We mostly tried to impose a battle in the horizontal plane and would not go into a vertical one. The Hurricane burned rapidly&nbsp;— and to cinders like a match&nbsp;— as it had [[Duralumin|dural]] covering only on the tail and wings, the rest was [[percale]]."<ref>Drabkin 2007, pp. 127–128:</ref>|group=N}}

===Burma, Ceylon, Singapore, and the Netherlands East Indies===
[[File:Hurricane singapore.jpg|thumb|Hawker Hurricane Mk.II of [[No. 232 Squadron RAF|232 Squadron]] shot down on 8 February 1942 during the [[Battle of Singapore]]]]

Following the outbreak of the [[Pacific War|war with Japan]], 51 Hurricane Mk IIBs were disassembled and sent in crates to [[Singapore]]; these and the 24 pilots (many of whom were veterans of the Battle of Britain) who had been transferred to the theatre formed the nucleus of five squadrons. They arrived on 3 January 1942, by which time the Allied fighter squadrons in Singapore, flying [[Brewster Buffalo]]s, had been overwhelmed during the [[Battle of Malaya|Malayan campaign]]. The [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]]'s fighter force, especially the [[Nakajima Ki-43]], had been underestimated in its capability, numbers and the strategy of its commanders.<ref name = "Hurricanes over Singapore">Cull and Sortehaug 2004</ref>

Thanks to the efforts of the 151st Maintenance unit, the 51 Hurricanes were assembled and ready for testing within 48 hours, and of these, 21 were ready for operational service within three days. The Hurricanes were fitted with bulky 'Vokes' dust filters under the nose and were armed with 12, rather than eight, machine guns. The additional weight and drag made them slow to climb and unwieldy to manoeuvre at altitude, although they were more effective bomber killers.<ref>Shores 1992, p. 297.</ref>

The recently arrived pilots were formed into [[No. 232 Squadron RAF|232 Squadron]]. In addition, [[No. 488 Squadron RNZAF|488(NZ) Squadron]], a Buffalo squadron, converted to Hurricanes. On 18 January, the two squadrons formed the basis of [[No. 226 Group RAF|226 Group]]. 232 Squadron became operational on 22 January and suffered the first losses and victories for the Hurricane in Southeast Asia.<ref name="Your Planes and Your Work Defend Your Empire">[http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/32022 "Your Planes and Your Work Defend Your Empire (Poster)."] ''Imperial War Museum'' (Printer: Fosh and Cross Ltd, London). Retrieved: 17 November 2011.</ref> Between 27 and 30 January, another 48 Hurricanes (Mk IIA) arrived with the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Indomitable|R92|6}}, from which they flew to airfields code-named P1 and P2, near [[Palembang]], [[Sumatra]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]].

Because of inadequate early warning systems (the first British radar stations became operational only towards the end of February), Japanese air raids were able to destroy 30 Hurricanes on the ground in Sumatra, most of them in one raid on 7 February. After Japanese [[Battle of Singapore|landings in Singapore]], on 10 February, the remnants of 232 and 488 Squadrons were withdrawn to Palembang. However, Japanese paratroopers began the [[Battle of Palembang|invasion of Sumatra]] on 13 February. Hurricanes destroyed six Japanese [[transport ship]]s on 14 February, but lost seven aircraft in the process. On 18 February, the remaining Allied aircraft and aircrews moved to [[Java (island)|Java]]. By this time, only 18 serviceable Hurricanes remained out of the original 99.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

That same month, 12 Hurricane Mk IIB Trops were supplied to the Dutch forces on Java.

When a Japanese carrier task force under the command of Admiral [[Chūichi Nagumo]] made a [[Indian Ocean raid|sortie into the Indian Ocean]] in April 1942, RAF Hurricanes based on [[Ceylon]] saw action against Nagumo's forces during attacks on [[Colombo]] on 5 April 1942 and on [[Trincomalee]] harbour on 9 April 1942.<ref name="Bloodyv2 p392-3,5,9">Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 392–393, 395, 399.</ref>

On 5 April 1942, Captain [[Mitsuo Fuchida]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], who led the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], led a strike against Colombo with 53 [[Nakajima B5N]] torpedo bombers and 38 [[Aichi D3A]] dive bombers, escorted by 36 [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters.<ref name="Bloodyv2 p395">Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, p. 395.</ref> They were opposed by 35 Hurricane I and IIBs of [[No. 30 Squadron RAF|30]] and [[No. 258 Squadron RAF|258 Squadrons]], together with six [[Fairey Fulmar]]s of [[803 Naval Air Squadron|803]] and [[806 Naval Air Squadron|806]] Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm.<ref name="Bloodyv2 p397">Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, p. 397.</ref> The Hurricanes mainly tried to shoot down the attacking bombers, but were engaged heavily by the escorting Zeros.<ref name="Vac p39">Vaccari 1995, p. 39.</ref> A total of 21 Hurricanes were shot down (although two of these were repairable),<ref name="Bloodyv2 p403">Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, p. 403.</ref> together with four Fulmars<ref name="Bloodyv2 p397-8">Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 397–398.</ref> and six Swordfish of [[788 Naval Air Squadron]] that had been surprised in flight by the raid.<ref name="Bloodyv2 p395-7">Shores, Cull and Izawa 1993, pp. 395–397.</ref> The RAF claimed 18 Japanese aircraft destroyed, seven probably destroyed and nine damaged, with one aircraft claimed by a Fulmar and five by anti-aircraft fire.

===Epilogue===
The battles over the [[Rakhine State|Arakan]] in 1943 represented the last large-scale use of the Hurricane as a pure day fighter. But they were still used in the fighter-bomber role in Burma until the end of the war and they were occasionally caught up in air combat as well. For example, on 15 February 1944, Flg Off Jagadish Chandra Verma of No 6 Sqdn of the [[Royal Indian Air Force]] shot down a Japanese [[Ki-43 Oscar]]: it was the only RIAF victory of the war.<ref name="Thomas 2003, p. 81">Thomas 2003, p. 81.</ref>  The Hurricane remained in service as a fighter-bomber over the [[Balkans]] and at home as well where it was used mainly for second-line tasks and occasionally flown by ace pilots. For example, in mid-1944, ace Sqdn Leader 'Jas' Storrar flew No 1687 Hurricane to deliver priority mail to Allied armies in France during the [[Normandy invasion]].<ref name="Thomas 2003, p. 81"/>

===Aircraft carrier operations===
{{main|Hawker Hurricane variants}}
The [[Hawker Hurricane variants|Sea Hurricane]] became operational in mid-1941 and scored its first kill while operating from {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} on 31 July 1941. During the next three years, [[Fleet Air Arm]] Sea Hurricanes were to feature prominently while operating from Royal Navy [[aircraft carriers]]. The Sea Hurricane scored an impressive kill-to-loss ratio,<ref>Shores et al., 1987</ref>{{refn|''Malta: The Spitfire Year 1942'' records 28 Sea Hurricane victories against eight losses during [[Operation Harpoon (1942)|Operation Harpoon]] and [[Operation Pedestal]]. |group=N}} primarily while defending [[Malta Convoys|Malta convoys]], and operating from [[escort carriers]] in the Atlantic Ocean. As an example, on 26 May 1944, Royal Navy [[Sea Hurricane]]s operating from the escort carrier [[HMS Nairana (D05)|HMS ''Nairana'']] claimed the destruction of three [[Junkers Ju 290|Ju 290]] reconnaissance aircraft during the defence of a convoy.<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/naval-obituaries/5533906/Lt-Cdr-Sammy-Mearns.html "Obituary of Lt-Cdr Sammy Mearns."] ''The Telegraph'' 14 June 2009. Retrieved: 20 September 2010.</ref>

==Hurricane aces==
The top scoring Hurricane pilot was [[Squadron Leader]] [[Marmaduke Pattle|Marmaduke "Pat" Pattle]], [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] & [[Medal bar|Bar]], with 35 Hawker fighter victories (out of career 50 total, with two shared) serving with No. 80 and 33 Squadrons. All of his Hurricane kills were achieved over Greece in 1941. He was shot down and killed in the Battle of Athens. Wing Commander [[Frank Reginald Carey]] claimed 28 air victories while flying Hurricanes during 1939–43, and [[Squadron Leader]] [[William Vale|William "Cherry" Vale]] [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] [[Medal bar|and Bar]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] totalled 20 kills (of 30) in Greece and Syria with No. 80 Squadron. Czech pilot F/Lt [[Karel Kuttelwascher|Karel M. Kuttelwascher]] achieved all of his 18 air victories with the Hurricane, most as an intruder night fighter with No. 1 Squadron. Pilot Officer V.C. Woodward (33 and 213 Squadrons) was another top-scoring ace with 14 (out of 18 total, three of which are shared), while F/Lt [[Richard P. Stevens]] claimed all of his 14.5 enemy aircraft flying the Hurricane.<ref name="Tomas p.83">Thomas 2003, p. 83.</ref> [[Richard John Cork|Richard "Dickie" Cork]] was the leading [[Fleet Air Arm]] Sea Hurricane ace, with nine destroyed, two shared, one probable, four damaged and seven destroyed on the ground.<ref>Thomas 2007, p. 87.</ref> Czech pilot [[Josef František]], flying with [[303 Polish Squadron]], shot down at least 17 enemy aircraft over southeast England during September–October 1940. Polish pilot [[Witold Urbanowicz]], flying with 303 Polish Squadron, had 15 confirmed kills and one probable during the Battle of Britain.

==Variants==
{{Main|Hawker Hurricane variants}}
[[File:Royal Air Force 1939-1945- Fighter Command F2344A.jpg|thumb|right|<center>Mk Is in France with original two-bladed Watts propellers</center>]]
;Hurricane Mk I
:First production version, with fabric-covered wings, a wooden two-bladed, fixed-[[Blade pitch|pitch]] [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]], powered by the {{convert|1,030|hp|kW|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] Mk II or III engines and armed with eight [[.303 British|.303 in]] (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]]. Produced between 1937 and 1939.

;Hurricane Mk I (revised)
:A revised Hurricane Mk I series built with a [[de Havilland]] or [[Dowty Rotol|Rotol]] constant speed metal propeller, metal-covered wings, armour and other improvements. In 1939, the RAF had taken on about 500 of this later design to form the backbone of the fighter squadrons.

;Hurricane Mk IIA Series 1
:Hurricane Mk I powered by the improved Merlin XX engine with two-speed supercharger. This new engine used a mix of 30 per cent glycol and 70 per cent water. Pure glycol is flammable, so not only was the new mix safer, but the engine also ran approximately 70 °F cooler, which gave longer engine life and greater reliability.<ref name="Schlaiefer p. 220">Schlaiefer 1950, p. 220.</ref> The new engine was longer than the earlier Merlin and so the Hurricane gained a 4.5 in "plug" in front of the cockpit, which made the aircraft slightly more stable due to the slight forward shift in centre of gravity.<ref name="Hiscock p. 16">Hiscock 2003, p. 16.</ref> First flew on 11 June 1940 and went into squadron service in September 1940.
[[File:Hurricane.jpg|150px|right|Hawker Hurricane Mk IIB ''Z5140'']]
;Hurricane Mk IIB (Hurricane IIA Series 2)
:The Hurricane II B were fitted with racks allowing them to carry two 250 lb or two 500 lb bombs. This lowered the top speed of the Hurricane to {{convert|301|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, but by this point mixed sweeps of Hurricanes protected by a fighter screen of Hurricanes were not uncommon. The same racks would allow the Hurricane to carry two 45-gallon (205 l) drop tanks instead of the bombs, more than doubling the Hurricane's fuel load.<ref name="Hiscock p. 18">Hiscock 2003, p. 18.</ref>

:Hurricane Mk IIA Series 2 was equipped with new and slightly longer propeller spinner and new wing mounting 12 x .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) Browning machine guns. The first aircraft were built in October 1940 and were renamed '''Mark IIB''' in April 1941.

;Hurricane Mk IIB Trop.
:For use in North Africa the Hawker Hurricane Mk IIB (and other variants) were tropicalised. They were fitted with Vokes and Rolls-Royce engine dust filters and the pilots were issued with a desert survival kit, including a bottle of water behind the cockpit.<ref name="Hiscock p. 19">Hiscock 2003, p. 19.</ref>
[[File:Hurricane IIC 3 Sqn RAF in flight c1942.jpg|150px|right|Hurricane Mk IIC ''BD867'' of 3 Sqn RAF, 1942]]
;Hurricane Mk IIC (Hurricane Mk IIA Series 2)
:Hurricane Mk IIA Series 1 equipped with new and slightly longer propeller spinner and fully replaced the machine-gun armament with four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in)  [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk II]] cannons, two per side. Hurricane IIA Series 2 became the Mk IIC in June 1941, using a slightly modified wing. The new wings also included a hardpoint for a {{convert|500|or|250|lb|abbr=on}} bomb, and later in 1941, fuel tanks. By then performance was inferior to the latest German fighters, and the Hurricane changed to the [[ground attack aircraft|ground-attack]] role, sometimes referred to as the '''Hurribomber'''. The mark also served as a [[night fighter]] and [[intruder (air combat)|intruder]].

;Hurricane Mk IID
:Hurricane Mk IIB conversion armed with two 40&nbsp;mm (1.57&nbsp;in) anti-tank autocannons in a [[Gun pod|gondola-style pod]], one under each wing and a single Browning machine gun in each wing loaded with tracers for aiming purposes. The first aircraft flew on 18 September 1941 and deliveries started in 1942. Serial built aircraft had additional armour for the pilot, radiator and engine, and were armed with a Rolls-Royce gun with 12 rounds, later changed to the 40&nbsp;mm (1.57&nbsp;in) [[Vickers S gun]] with 15 rounds. The outer wing attachments were strengthened so that 4G could be pulled at a weight of 8,540 lb (3,874 kg).<ref name="Hiscock p. 17">Hiscock 2003, p. 17.</ref> The weight of guns and armour protection marginally impacted the aircraft's performance. These Hurricanes were nicknamed "Flying Can Openers", perhaps a play on the No. 6 Squadron's logo which flew the Hurricane starting in 1941.
[[File:Hurricane IID 6 Sqn RAF over Western Desert 1942.jpg|150px|right|Hurricane IID of 6 Sqn showing Vokes tropical filter and RAF desert camouflage in 1942.]]
;Hurricane Mk IIE
:Another wing modification was introduced in the '''Mk IIE''', but the changes became extensive enough that it was renamed the '''Mk IV''' after the first 250 had been delivered.

;Hurricane Mk T.IIC
[[File:A Two-seat Hawker Hurricane of Air Force of Iran.jpg|140px]]
:Two-seat training version of the Mk. IIC. Only two aircraft were built for the [[Imperial Iranian Air Force]].

;Hurricane Mk III
:Version of the Hurricane Mk II powered by a [[Packard]]-built Merlin engine, intending to provide supplies of the British-built engines for other designs. By the time production was to have started, Merlin production had increased to the point where the idea was abandoned.
[[File:Hawker Hurricane Mark IV.jpg|150px|right|Hurricane Mk IV, armed with RP-3 rockets]]
;Hurricane Mk IV
:The last major change to the Hurricane was the introduction of the "universal Wing", a single design able to mount two {{convert|250|or|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bombs, two 40&nbsp;mm (1.57&nbsp;in) Vickers S guns, drop tanks or eight [[RP-3|"60 pounder" RP-3]] rockets. Two .303&nbsp;in Brownings were fitted to aid aiming of the heavier armament.<ref name="Mason Hawker p285">Mason 1991, p. 285.</ref> The new design also incorporated the improved Merlin 24 or 27 engines of {{convert|1,620|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, equipped with dust filters for desert operations. The Merlin 27 had a redesigned oil system that was better suited to operations in the tropics, and which was rated at a slightly lower altitude in keeping with the Hurricane's new role as a close-support fighter. The radiator was deeper and armoured. Additional armour was also fitted around the engine.<ref name="Hiscock p. 20">Hiscock 2003, p. 20.</ref>

;Hurricane Mk V
:The final variant to be produced. Only three were built and it never reached production. This was powered by a Merlin 32 boosted engine to give 1,700&nbsp;hp at low level and was intended as a dedicated ground-attack aircraft to use in Burma. All three prototypes had four-bladed propellers. Speed was {{convert|326|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at 500&nbsp;ft, which is comparable with the Hurricane I despite being one and a half times as heavy.<ref name="Hiscock p. 20"/>

;Hurricane Mk X
:Canadian-built variant. Single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber. Powered by a {{convert|1,300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Packard Merlin 28. Eight 0.303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns mounted in the wings. In total, 490 were built.

;Hurricane Mk XI
:Canadian-built variant. 150 were built.

;Hurricane Mk XII
:Canadian-built variant. Single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber. Powered by a 1,300&nbsp;hp (969&nbsp;kW) Packard Merlin 29. Initially armed with 12 0.303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, but this was later changed to four 20&nbsp;mm (.79&nbsp;in) cannon.

;Hurricane Mk XIIA
:Canadian-built variant. Single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber. Powered by a {{convert|1,300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Packard Merlin 29, armed with eight 0.303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns.
[[File:The Royal Navy during the Second World War A9421.jpg|150px|right]]
;Sea Hurricane Mk IA
:The Sea Hurricane Mk IA was a Hurricane Mk I modified by [[General Aircraft Limited]]. These conversions numbered approximately 250 aircraft. They were modified to be carried by [[CAM ship]]s ([[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] armed [[Cargo ship|merchantman]]), whose ships' crews were Merchant Marine and whose Hurricanes were crewed and serviced by RAF personnel, or Fighter Catapult Ships, which were Naval Auxiliary Vessels crewed by naval personnel and aircraft operated by the Fleet Air Arm. These ships were equipped with a catapult for launching an aircraft, but without facilities to recover them. Consequently, if the aircraft were not in range of a land base, pilots were forced to bail out or to ditch.
:Both of these options had their problems&nbsp;— there was always a chance of striking part of the fuselage when bailing out and a number of pilots had been killed in this way. Ditching the Hurricane in the sea called for skill as the radiator housing acted as a water brake, pitching the nose of the fighter downwards when it hit the water, while also acting as very efficient scoop, helping to flood the Hurricane so that a quick exit was advisable before the aircraft sank.<ref name="Hiscock p. 20"/>  Then the pilot had to be picked up by the ship. More than 80 modifications were needed to convert a Hurricane into a Sea Hurricane, including new radios to conform with those used by the Fleet Air Arm and new instrumentation to read in knots rather than miles per hour.<ref name="Hiscock p. 19"/> They were informally known as "Hurricats".
:The majority of the aircraft modified had suffered wear-and-tear serving with front line squadrons, so much so that at least one example used during trials broke up under the stress of a catapult launching. CAM Sea Hurricanes were launched operationally on eight occasions and the Hurricanes shot down six enemy aircraft for the loss of one Hurricane pilot killed.<ref name="Brown, Eric p112">Brown 1980, p. 112.</ref> The first Sea Hurricane IA kill was an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200|FW 200C ''Condor'']], shot down on 2 August 1941.<ref>Brown 1980, p. 109.</ref>
[[File:Hawker Hurricane03.jpg|150px|right|Preserved Sea Hurricane of the [[Fleet Air Arm]].]]
;Sea Hurricane Mk IB
:Hurricane Mk I version equipped with catapult spools plus an arrester hook.<ref name="Brown, Eric p114">Brown 1980, p. 114.</ref> From July 1941 they operated from {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} and from October 1941, they were used on [[Merchant aircraft carrier]] (MAC ships), which were large cargo vessels with a flight deck fitted, enabling aircraft to be launched and recovered. A total of 340 aircraft were converted. The first Sea Hurricane IB kill occurred on 31 July 1941 when Sea Hurricanes of 880 squadron FAA operating from HMS ''Furious'' shot down a [[Dornier Do 18|Do 18 flying-boat]].<ref>Thetford 1994, p. 228.</ref>

;Sea Hurricane Mk IC
:Hurricane Mk I<ref name="Brown, Eric p114"/> version equipped with catapult spools, an arrester hook and the four-cannon wing. From February 1942, 400 aircraft were converted. The Sea Hurricane IC used during ''[[Operation Pedestal]]'' had their Merlin III engines modified to accept 16 lb boost, and could generate more than 1400&nbsp;hp at low altitude.<ref>Brown 1980, p. 115.</ref><ref>[http://www.wwiiaircraftperformance.org/merlin3-rating.jpg Data on the Merlin III engine and 16 lb boost.]</ref> Lt. R. J. Cork was credited with five kills while flying a Sea Hurricane IC during ''Operation Pedestal''.<ref>Thetford 1994, p. 231.</ref>

;Sea Hurricane Mk IIC
:Hurricane Mk IIC version equipped with naval radio gear; 400 aircraft were converted and used on fleet carriers. The Merlin XX engine on the Sea Hurricane generated 1460&nbsp;hp at 6,250 ft and 1435&nbsp;hp at 11,000 ft. Top speed was 322 mph at 13,500ft and 342 mph at 22,000 ft.<ref name="Brown, Eric p112"/>

;Sea Hurricane Mk XIIA
:Canadian-built Hurricane Mk XIIA converted into Sea Hurricanes.

;Hillson F.40 (a.k.a. F.H.40)
:A full-scale version of the Hills & Son [[Hillson Bi-mono|Bi-mono]] slip-wing Biplane/monoplane, using a Hawker Hurricane Mk I returned from Canada as RCAF ser no 321 (RAF serial L1884). Taxi and flight trials carried out at [[RAF Sealand]] during May 1943, and at the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]], Boscombe Down from September 1943. The upper wing was not released in flight before the programme was terminated due to poor performance.<ref name="Jarret AM p18-3">Jarrett ''Aeroplane Monthly'' January 1991, pp. 18–23.</ref>

;Hurricane Photo Reconnaissance
:In Egypt, the Service Depot at Heliopolis converted several Hurricanes Is for the role. The first three were converted in January 1941. Two carried a pair of [[F24 camera]]s with 8-inch focal length lenses. The third carried one vertical and two oblique F24s with 14-inch focal length lenses mounted in the rear fuselage, close to the trailing edge of the wing, and a fairing was built up over the lenses aft of the radiator housing. A further five Hurricanes were modified in March 1941 while two were converted in a similar manner in Malta during April 1941. During October 1941 a batch of six Hurricane IIs was converted to PR Mark II status and a final batch, thought to be of 12 aircraft, was converted in late 1941. The PR Mark II was said to be capable of slightly over {{convert|350|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and was able to reach {{convert|38,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Hiscock p. 18"/>

;Hurricane Tac R
:For duties closer to the front lines some Hurricanes were converted to Tactical Reconnaissance (Tac R) aircraft. An additional radio was fitted for liaison with ground forces who were better placed to direct the Hurricane. Some Hurricane Tac R aircraft also had a vertical camera fitted in the rear fuselage, so to compensate for the extra weight either one or two Brownings or two cannons would be omitted. Externally these aircraft were only distinguishable by the missing armament.<ref name="Hiscock p. 18"/>

==Operators==
[[File:Yu Hurricane.jpg|thumb|Hawker Hurricane Mk IVRP with Yugoslav Air Force markings, [[Museum of Aviation in Belgrade]], [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]]]
{{See also|List of Hawker Hurricane operators}}

Due to its lightweight, yet robust, construction and ease of maintenance, the Hurricane had a long operational life in many theatres of war. It was also built by, or exported to, several other countries. The Hurricane was unusual in that it was flown operationally by both the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis]] during the war. In some cases (e.g. Portugal and Ireland) the Hurricane was pressed into service after being forced to land in a neutral country.

In 1939 [[Latvia]] ordered 30 Hurricane fighters and paid for them. However, due to the start of the Second World War in September 1939, the aircraft were never delivered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lffb.lv/apskati/latavio.html|title=Latavio|author=Ilmārs|work=lffb.lv|language=Latvian}}</ref>
