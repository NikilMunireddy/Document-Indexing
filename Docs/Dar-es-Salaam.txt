'''Dar es Salaam''' (from {{lang-ar|دار السلام}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Dār as-Salām}}'', literally "the residence of peace"; or simply '''Dar''', formerly '''Mzizima''') is the largest city of [[Tanzania]] and the largest city in eastern Africa by population, as well as a regionally important economic centre.<ref name="World Factbook">{{cite web|title=Major urban areas - population|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2219.html|website=cia.gov|accessdate=18 November 2014|ref=dar es salaam population}}</ref> It is Tanzania's most prominent city in arts, fashion, media, music, film and television.

[[File:Dar es salaam Skyline from the sea.jpg|thumb|Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA, under construction) and PSPF Pension Twin Towers both in the background are the tallest in East and Central Africa. ]]
It is the capital of the [[Dar es Salaam Region]] administrative province and consists of three boroughs or administrative districts: northern [[Kinondoni]], central [[Ilala District|Ilala]], and southern [[Temeke]]. The city is the leading arrival and departure point for most tourists who visit tourism areas in Tanzania like the national parks for safaris and the islands of [[Zanzibar]]. The region had a population of 4,364,541 as of the official 2012 census.<ref name="2012 census">[http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf Population Distribution by Administrative Units, United Republic of Tanzania, 2013]</ref>{{rp|page: 2}} Although Dar es Salaam lost its status as the nation's capital to [[Dodoma]] in 1974 (not completed until 1996), it remains the focus of the permanent central government bureaucracy.

{{see also|Timeline of Dar es Salaam}}
[[File:Dar es Salaam Cenotaph.jpg|thumb|Dar es Salaam cenotaph]]

In the 19th century, Mzizima ([[Swahili language|Kiswahili]] for "healthy town") was a coastal fishing village on the periphery of [[Indian Ocean trade]] routes.<ref name=UNHSP>{{Cite book  | last = United Nations Human Settlements Programme | authorlink = United Nations Human Settlements Programme | title = The State of African Cities 2008 | publisher = UN-HABITAT | year = 2009 | pages =130 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UR0fckrquD8C&pg=PA130 | isbn =92-1-132015-1}}</ref><ref name=Brennan>{{Cite book | last = Brennan | first = James R.  | last2 = Burton | first2 = Andrew | chapter = The Emerging Metropolis: A history of Dar es Salaam, circa 1862–2000 | title = Dar es Salaam: histories from an emerging African metropolis | publisher = African Books Collective | year = 2007 | pages = 13 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-54DSfk0ZMgC&pg=PA13 | isbn = 9987-449-70-0}}</ref> In 1865 or 1866, Sultan [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar]] began building a new city very close to Mzizima<ref name=Brennan/> and named it Dar es Salaam. The name is commonly translated as "abode/home of peace", based on the Arabic ''dar'' ("house"), and the Arabic ''es salaam'' ("of peace").<ref name=Brennan/> Dar es Salaam fell into decline after Majid's death in 1870, but was revived in 1887 when the [[German East Africa Company]] established a station there. The town's growth was facilitated by its role as the administrative and commercial centre of [[German East Africa]] and industrial expansion resulting from the construction of the [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Central Railway Line]] in the early 1900s.

German East Africa was captured by the British during [[World War I]] and became [[Tanganyika]], with Dar es Salaam the administrative and commercial centre. Under British [[indirect rule]], separate European (e.g., [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]]) and African (e.g., [[Kariakoo]] and [[Ilala District|Ilala]]) areas developed at a distance from the city centre. The city's population also included a large number of [[Indians in Tanzania|south Asians]]. After [[World War II]], Dar es Salaam experienced a period of rapid growth.

Political developments, including the formation and growth of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]], led to [[Tanganyika]] attaining independence from colonial rule in December 1961. Dar es Salaam continued to serve as its capital, even when in 1964 Tanganyika and [[Zanzibar]] merged to form Tanzania. In 1973, however, provisions were made to relocate the capital to [[Dodoma]], a more centrally located city in the interior. The relocation process has not yet been completed, and Dar es Salaam remains Tanzania's primary city.

In 1967, the [[Government of Tanzania|Tanzanian government]] declared the ''[[Ujamaa]] policy'', that set Tanzania into a socialist path. The move slowed down the potential growth of the city as the government encouraged people not to move in cities but stay in [[Ujamaa]] socialist villages. But by 1980's the [[Ujamaa]] policy proved to be a failure into combating increasing poverty, hunger, and delayed development that Tanzania faced. This led to the 1980s liberalization policy that virtually ended socialism and its spirit within the Tanzania's government. The move led to increasing migration of rural dwellers from rural areas into cities with Dar es Salaam becoming the leading city in receiving migrants from rural areas.<ref name="allafrica.com">{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201308060352.html|title=allAfrica.com: Tanzania: Construction Booms As Public, Private Sector Investments Soar|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>

Until the late 1990s, Dar es Salaam was not put into same category as Africa's leading cities like [[Nairobi]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Lagos]], or [[Addis Ababa]]. But the 2000s decade became the turning point as the city experienced one of Africa's fastest urbanization rates as businesses were opened and prospered, [[List of banks in Tanzania|Tanzanian banks]] headquartered in the city started to run more proper,{{clarify|date=December 2015}} the [[Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange]] expanded, and the [[Port of Dar es Salaam|Dar es Salaam harbour]] proved to be the most important in Tanzania and prominent for entrepot trade with landlocked countries like the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], and [[Zambia]].

Dar es Salaam is the largest city in Tanzania. With a population increase of 5.6 percent per year from 2002 to 2012, the city is the third fastest growing in Africa (ninth fastest in the world), after [[Bamako]] and [[Lagos]]. The metro population is expected to reach 5.12 million by 2020 and predicted to be as high as 76 million by the year 2100, making Dar Es Salaam the second largest city on earth (after Lagos), by 2100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_growth1.html|title=City Mayors: World's fastest growing urban areas (1)|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref>http://media.wix.com/ugd/672989_62cfa13ec4ba47788f78ad660489a2fa.pdf</ref>

==Economy and infrastructure==
[[File:Bank of Tanzania golden hour.jpg|thumb|[[Bank of Tanzania]]|left]]

Dar es Salaam is Tanzania's most important city for both business and government. The city contains high concentrations of trade and other services and manufacturing compared to other parts of Tanzania, which has about 80 percent of its population in rural areas. Downtown includes  small businesses, many of which are run by traders and proprietors whose families originated from the Middle East and Indian sub-continent—areas of the world with which the settlements of the Tanzanian coast have had long-standing trading relations.

The Dar es Salaam CBD made up of [[Kisutu, Dar Es Salaam|Kisutu]], [[Kivukoni]], [[Upanga West|Upanga]] and [[Kariakoo]] areas is Tanzania's largest city CBD. All three areas making up the downtown are found in the Ilala district. Kivukoni has the city's important fish market, the Magogoni fish market. Kivukoni also is the place where the Tanzania's central bank, The [[Bank of Tanzania]] is located, so is the [[Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange]].<ref name="allafrica.com"/> Kisutu has businesses and offices and is the location of Dar es Salaam central railway station, the PSPF Towers and the TPA tower. Kariakoo is the prominent shopping area with streets like Congo Street for clothing shops. Uhuru street is for computer and electronics, Msimbazi for mobile phones.
[[File:The bird's view of the harbour in Dar es Salaam.jpg|thumb|[[Port of Dar es Salaam|Dar es Salaam Port]]]]

Dar es Salaam has a problem with slums. According to a [[United Nations]] estimate, 70 percent of the city's population lives in informal settlements.<ref name="Megacity">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18655647 "Dar es Salaam: Africa's next megacity?", ''BBC News'', reported by Joe Boyle, 30 July 2012]</ref> The poorer residents crowd into downtown areas or large slums, many without running water or basic services.<ref name="Megacity"/> The more wealthy live in beachside mansions in the city's northern districts.<ref name="Megacity"/>

On a natural harbour on the [[Indian Ocean]], it is the hub of the [[Transport in Tanzania|Tanzanian transportation system]] as the main railways and several  highways originate in or near the city.

Dar es Salaam has had{{when|date=June 2013}} a major construction boom. The [[PSPF Twin Towers]] with more than 35 stories is the tallest building in the city and the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecitizen.co.tz/News/Dar-s-skyscraper-boom--Watchers-see-signs-of-prosperity-/-/1840392/2412228/-/15fryogz/-/index.html|title=Dar skyscraper boom: Here’s the untold story - National|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Dar es Salaam has major infrastructural problems, including an outdated transport system and occasional power rationing.

==Climate==
Due to close proximity to the [[equator]] and the warm Indian Ocean, the city experiences tropical climatic conditions, typified by hot and humid weather throughout much of the year. It has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Aw). Annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1100|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and in a normal year there are two rainy seasons: "the long rains" in April and May and "the short rains" in November and December.

The [[Julius Nyerere International Airport]] is the principal airport serving the country. [[Tanzania Railways]] operates the [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Central Line]] from Dar es Salaam to [[Kigoma]]. The [[TAZARA Railway]] connects Dar es Salaam to Zambia. 

Most intracity transport is by the [[dala dala]] (minibus) or [[Dar es Salaam commuter rail]].

The [[Dar es Salaam bus rapid transit|bus rapid transit]] system under construction will be operated by the Dar Rapid Transit Agency (DART),<ref name="DART Official Site">{{cite web |url=http://www.dart.go.tz/ |title=Dar Rapid Transit - DART |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=dart.go.tz |publisher=dart.go.tz |access-date=23 February 2015}}</ref> a government entity, and is expected to open at the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201308200278.html|title=allAfrica.com: Tanzania: Rapid Transit System Takes Shape|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> DART is being sponsored by the [[World Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2013/01/15/additional-financing-tanzania-bus-rapid-transit-system-benefit-300000-commuters-create-80000-jobs|title=Additional Financing for Tanzania’s Bus Rapid Transit System to benefit 300,000 Commuters and Create 80,000 Jobs|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>
 
Dala dala minibuses are involved in many road accidents, accounting for a large percentage of the 4000+ yearly road deaths.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

[[Dala dala]]s are cheap and often overcrowded. They are operated by a driver and a conductor: the conductor collects the fare and signals the driver to leave.  They tend to be overcrowded, with passengers sometimes hanging outside the door.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

=== Port ===
The city has the country's busiest port and the [[Port of Dar es Salaam]] handles 90% of the country's cargo. Due to huge influx of cargo and the slow pace of expansion a new cargo port 60&nbsp;km north of Dar es Salaam is proposed at [[Bagamoyo Port|Bagamoyo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railpage.com.au/f-p1946759.htm#1946759|title=Railpage|work=Railpage|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>

Dar es Salaam has heavy traffic during the daytime, but after sunset the area is relatively quiet as much of the city's nightlife is located in more residential districts away from the city's mainly commercial centre.

The sprawling suburbs furthest from the city centre are generally populated by Tanzanians of African descent, with the exception of [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oyster Bay]], where there is a large population of foreign expatriates. The edges of Dar es Salaam are spreading rapidly, severely taxing the transportation network (which aside from ferries, lacks any kind of mass transit facilities)<ref>{{cite web | title=A Taxi Ride to the Client Office in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania | url=http://drshem.com/2011/05/30/a-taxi-ride-to-the-client-office-in-dar-es-salaam-tanzania/ | work=A Taxi Ride to the Client Office in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania | accessdate=2011-06-11}}</ref> and raising the prospect of future urban overcrowding.

===Food===

{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
Due in part to the growth of the expatriate community and the increasing importance of tourism, the number of international restaurants has risen  rapidly. The cityoffers a diversity of cuisine, ranging from traditional Tanzanian Barbecue-style options, such as ''Nyama Choma'' (Roasted [[meat]]—served with [[rice]] or [[ugali]]) and ''Mishkaki'' ([[Shish kebab]]—usually barbecued and served with [[salt]], hot [[chili pepper]]s, [[chapati]], [[French fries|fries]], and [[rice]] on the side), as well as the long-established traditional [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Zanzibari cuisine]], to options from all corners of the globe, including [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese food]]. People who prefer neither fast food nor traditional restaurants buy their food from street vendors, who usually sell food at low prices. [[Samosa]]s (''sambusas'') are common street food items within the city, as the area is largely influenced by the foods brought from [[India]].

[[File:The African tranditional dance in Dar es Salaam..jpg|thumb|African traditional dance in Dar es Salaam]]
The music scene in Dar es Salaam is divided between several styles. The longest standing style is live dance music ([[muziki wa dansi]]) bands such as [[DDC Mlimani Park Orchestra]]. [[Taarab]] which was traditionally strong in [[Zanzibar]] has also found a niche. However, it remains small compared both to dance music and "[[Tanzanian hip hop|Bongo Flava]]", a broad category that represents the Tanzanian take on Hip Hop and R&B, which has quickly become the most popular locally produced music. Traditional music, which locally is used to refer to tribal music is still performed but typically only on family oriented occasions such as weddings.

This [[rap music|rap]] scene is also present.<ref>[http://www.africanhiphop.com/update/halisi.htm Africanhiphop.com presents: Hali Halisi—the Real Situation]</ref>

In the 1970s, the Ministry of National Youth Culture aimed to create a national culture, which stressed the importance of music.  Dar es Salaam became the music center in Tanzania, with the local radio exposing new bands and dominating the music and cultural scene. With this ujamaa, or family, mentality governing culture and music a unified people’s culture was created, leading to the rise of hip hop music.<ref name=Lemelle/> Throughout the years, the radio in Dar es Salaam has played a major role in the dissemination of music because many people don’t have television and cassettes are used over CDs.

===Tourism===
[[File:Villagemuseum.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Tanzanian hut in the Village Museum]]
Dar es Salaam has two of the five museums comprising the [[National Museum of Tanzania]] consortium, namely the National Museum proper and the Village Museum.  The National Museum is dedicated to the history of Tanzania; most notably, it exhibits some of the bones of ''[[Paranthropus boisei]]'' that were among the findings of [[Louis Leakey]] at [[Olduvai Gorge|Olduvai]].  The Village Museum, located in the outskirts of the city on the road to [[Bagamoyo]], showcases traditional [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s from 16 different Tanzanian ethnic groups.  There are also examples of traditional cultivations, and traditional music and dance shows are held daily.

Close to the National Museum are also the [[botanical garden]]s, with tropical plants and trees.

There are beaches on the [[Msasani]] peninsula north of Dar es Salaam and in [[Kigamboni]] to the south. Trips to the nearby islands of the  [[Dar es Salaam Marine Reserve]] are a popular daytrip from the city and a spot for snorkeling, swimming and sunbathing. [[Bongoyo Island]] can be reached by boat from the Msasani Slipway.

==Art==
[[File:Nyumba ya sanaa dar es salaam.jpg|thumb|The main gate of Nyumba ya Sanaa, with decorations by Tanzanian sculptor George Lilanga]]
Dar es Salaam (and specifically the area of Oyster Bay) is home to the [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]] painting style.  The [[Nyumba ya sanaa]] ("House of Art") is a cultural centre, workshop and shop dedicated to Tanzanian art, showcasing and promoting Tanzanian craftmanship.  Prominent Tanzanian sculptor [[George Lilanga]] has donated  some of his works to the centre, including decorations of the building's main entrance.

===Newspapers===
Dar has newspapers available, particularly from sellers prowling through stationary traffic at road intersections. English-language ones, with online presences, include ''The Citizen'' and ''The Guardian'' and the leading Kiswahili daily, Mwananchi.Business Times is the only financial and economic newspaper in town. It was established in 1988 and became the first ever private newspaper in Tanzania. Business Times also owns Majira, the Kiswahili leading newspaper in Tanzania.

===Internet access===
Installation of a [[SEACOM (African cable system)|trans-Indian Ocean backbone cable]] in 2009 has, in theory, made Internet access much more readily available in Dar in particular and in East Africa in general. However, roll-out to end-users is slow, partly because of spotty telephone line coverage, partly due to the substantial prices and long contracts demanded for purchase of bandwidth for small ISPs. Mobile-telephone access to the Internet via [[3G]] and [[3.75G]] is still relatively expensive.

[[Internet cafes]] are found in the city centre.

The expressed aim of the [[SEACOM (African cable system)|SEACOM cable]] is to enable East Africa to develop economically through increased online trading.

==Globalization==
[[File:The front view of Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre in Dar es Salaam.jpg|thumb|Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre in Dar es Salaam]]

Dar es Salaam is the city in Tanzania to which villagers flock for better opportunities. Westerners and Asians are also settling in Dar es Salaam, and the surge of foreigners has put pressure on local officials to develop policies better accommodating the growing diverse population of the city and its suburbs.

==Suburbs==
Dar es Salaam is divided into three districts: Ilala, Kinondoni, and Temeke. All three are governed as municipal councils, and so all of the city's suburbs or wards are affiliated with them.

===Kinondoni===
Kinondoni is the most populated amongst the districts, with half of the city's population residing within it. It is also home to high-income suburbs. These include:
[[File:Msakai, Dar es salaam.jpg|thumb|Masaki, Dar es salaam]]
[[File:Coco Beach.jpg|thumb|Coco Beach]]
* '''Masaki, [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Oysterbay]] and [[Ada Estate]]''' are the high-income suburbs located along the central beach. During the Colonial Era, they were the major European suburbs of the city. Now diplomats and expatriates reside in these areas.  Oysterbay Beach, also known as Coco Beach, is the only white sandy beach in Kinondoni and is the most famous in the area. Many luxury apartments line the waterfront, accommodating the rapid growth of foreigners, mostly Europeans and Asians.
* '''Mikocheni and Regent Estate''' are also suburbs within the district. According to the 2012 census, the Mikocheni ward had a population of 32,947.<ref name="2012 census"/>{{rp|page: 75}} Mikocheni is the home of some political figures, including the first president of Tanzania, [[Julius K. Nyerere]] and opposition party leader, [[Freeman Mbowe]].
* '''[[Msasani]]''' is a peninsula to the northeast of the city center. It is home to expatriates from the United Kingdom and other western countries. Msasani contains a mixture of traditional shops and western-oriented resorts and stores.
* '''Mbezi Beach''' is the beachfront suburb located along the northern Dar es Salaam Beach. It is noted for its beautiful beaches with several tourist hotels, and also as the place of residence of people of high social status and some politicians.
* '''Sinza, Kijitonyama, Magomeni, [[Kinondoni]] and [[Mwenge, Dar es Salaam|Mwenge]]''' are more ethnically mixed than the areas above. The wards also have the most prosperous business climate outside of the central business district, with shops, bars, restaurants and hotels located there.
* '''Kimara and Mbezi Louis''' are hilly, mostly upper class, suburbs far from the city. Due to the distance from the city center, it is quieter, with cooler weather.
* '''Manzese, Tandale, Mwananyamala-Kisiwani and Kigogo''' are considered low-income neighborhoods characterized by poor settlement planning, low quality housing and social services.

===Ilala===
[[File:Askari monument dar es salaam.jpg|thumb|The Askari Monument marks the exact center of Dar es Salaam, in the Ilala district]]
Ilala is the administrative district of Dar es Salaam where almost all government offices and ministries are housed. The Central Business District (locally called "Posta") is located in this district. It is the transportation hub of the city, as the Julius Nyerere International Airport, Central Railway Station and Tazara Railway Station are all within the district boundaries. The residential areas are mainly middle to high-income, and some of these are:
* '''Upanga & Kisutu''' had the highest concentration of Asian communities within Dar es Salaam, with residents of Indian and Arabian descent. These areas are also famous for the colonial houses and mansions built in Indian, Arabic and European styles.
* '''[[Kariakoo]]''' is the shopping district of the city, perhaps the busiest and largest in East Africa. Shops, bazaars and merchants dot the streets, selling products from foodstuffs to hardware materials. The Kariakoo Market, which is the largest, contains the only underground section of the city. It is the major supply point of the food consumed by all the residents of Dar es Salaam.
* '''Tabata, Segerea and Ukonga''' are located a bit farther from the city center. They are growing to become among the busiest in terms of business and entertainment. This has caused serious traffic congestion, which is said to be the worst in all of Dar es Salaam.
* '''Ilala''' is among the middle income suburbs very near to the city center, and is marked by the [[Askari Monument]]. It contains some rival gang groups, whose activities include drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion and racketeering. Most famous gang groups are recognized by the color of their scarf (bandanna). These are the black gang, red gang and blue gang, fighting for control and to maintain their territories and interests.

===Temeke===
[[File:Ship dar.JPG|thumb|Ship at [[Port of Dar es Salaam]]]]
[[File:Kigamboni bridge.jpg.jpg|thumb|Nyerere Bridge in Kigamboni connects Kigamboni suburbs with Dar es salaam CBD through kurasini.]]
Temeke is the industrial district of the city, where the manufacturing centers (heavy and light industry) are located. The [[Port of Dar es Salaam]], which is the largest in the country, is found here. Temeke is believed to have the largest concentration of low-income residents due to industry. Port officials, military and police officers live there.

*'''Kurasini''' located on the Dar es Salaam Harbour, is the home of the Dar es Salaam Port, The Police College, Mgulani Police Barracks and the Dar es Salaam International Trade Fair Grounds. Thus, the main residents are police officers and port officials.
*'''Chang'ombe''' is one of the only higher income areas in Temeke. It has maintained this status due to occupation by African high colonial officers and some industry owners from the colonial era. Chang'ombe is the home of the Dar es Salaam University College of Education, The National Stadium and Uhuru Stadium.
*'''Temeke, Mtoni and Tandika''' are middle to low-income suburbs.
* '''Mbagala and Kijichi''' are middle to low-income suburbs. Mbagala is the largest suburb in the whole district, and is also considered a slum.
*[[File:Bandarini.jpg|thumb|railway tracks over kurasini road, Dar es Salaam]]'''Kigamboni (South Beach)''' is a beach front suburb on a peninsula with beautiful, sandy beaches. It is home to a mixed population of lower and higher incomes. There is demand from higher-income people to live in Kigamboni due to its low population density and proximity to the sea, but this demand is constrained by the area being mainly accessible by ferry involving long waiting times for those wishing to cross in a private vehicle, although crossing the ferry on foot or bicycle is quite quick.  There are beach resorts in Kigamboni.[[File:Tanzania National Main Stadium.jpg|thumb|Tanzania National Main Stadium]]

==Sports==
Dar es Salaam is the sports center of Tanzania. Dar es Salaam hosts the second largest stadium in [[East Africa|East]] and [[Central Africa]] ([[Benjamin Mkapa National Stadium|National Stadium]]), which can accommodate up to 60,000 people.
