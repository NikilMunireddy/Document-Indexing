The '''AmericanAirlines Arena''' is a sports and entertainment [[arena]] located in [[Downtown Miami|Downtown]] [[Miami]], [[Florida]] along [[Biscayne Bay]]. It was constructed beginning in 1998 as a replacement for the [[Miami Arena]] and was designed by the architecture firms [[Arquitectonica]] and [[360 Architecture]]. The Arena is home to the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]].

The AmericanAirlines Arena is directly served by the [[Miami Metrorail]] at [[Government Center (MDT station)|Government Center]] station via free transfers to [[Metromover]] Omni Loop, providing direct service to [[Freedom Tower (Metromover station)|Freedom Tower]] and [[Park West (Metromover station)|Park West]] stations. The Arena is also within walking distance from the [[Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre (Metrorail station)|Historic Overtown/Lyric Theatre]] Metrorail station.

The AmericanAirlines Arena has 2,105 club seats, 80 luxury suites, and 76 private boxes.  The '''Waterfront Theater''' is  Florida's largest theater which is housed within the arena, that can seat between 3,000 and 5,800. The theater can be configured for [[concerts]], family events, [[musical theatre]] and other stage shows. [[American Airlines]] which has a hub at [[Miami International Airport]] maintains the AmericanAirlines Arena Travel Center at the venue.<ref>"[http://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p=/aboutUs/whereWeFly/tickets/tc_MIA.jsp Miami And Coral Gables, FL Travel Center]." ''[[American Airlines]]''. Retrieved on April 9, 2009.</ref>

The airline also holds the naming rights for another NBA venue, the [[American Airlines Center]] for the [[Dallas Mavericks]], which opened in 2001.

==History==
The AmericanAirlines Arena opened on December 31, 1999 and its construction cost was $213 million. Architectural design team members included George Heinlein, Cristian Petschen, Reinaldo Borges, and Lance Simon. The AmericanAirlines Arena was inaugurated with a concert by [[Gloria Estefan]].  Two days later, on January 2, 2000, the Miami Heat played its first game in the new arena by defeating the [[Orlando Magic]] 111–103.

As part of its sponsorship arrangement, [[American Airlines]] had a giant aircraft painted on top of the arena's roof, with an American Airlines logo in the center. The design is visible from airplanes taking off and landing at [[Miami International Airport]], where American has a hub. The arena also has luxury skyboxes called "Flagship Lounges", a trademark originally used for American's premium-class lounges at certain airports.

Local sportscasters often refer to the arena as the "triple-A". Some sports reporters on the local news stations such as [[WSVN]] have referred to the arena as "A<sup>3</sup>" (A cubed). The arena is known for its unusual [[scoreboard]], designed by Artist Christopher Janney. Drawing on the underwater anemone forms, the scoreboard also changes colors depending on the atmosphere. For concerts in an arena configuration, end stage capacity is 12,202 for 180° shows, 15,402 for 270° shows, 18,309 for 360° shows. For center stage concerts the arena can seat 19,146.

The Miami Heat has not had to pay to use the $357 million-venue, which sits on $38 million of county land; the county has paid $64 million in operating subsidies. "It was never a good deal," says former Miami-Dade Commissioner Katy Sorenson, who opposed the new arena in 1996. "There are certain politicians who just get stars in their eyes and don't really think about what the real cost is going to be."

[[WTVJ]], the city's NBC owned-and-operated station in Miami, had their Downtown Miami Studios in the back of the arena from 2001 till 2011.

Despite American Airline's logo change, American Airlines Arena still uses the airline's old logo.
