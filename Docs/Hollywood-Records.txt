==History==
Hollywood Records was founded in 1989 by [[Michael Dammann Eisner]], then CEO of [[The Walt Disney Company]] as a way of expanding the company's music operations by looking to develop and promote the careers of a wide variety of artists in various genres.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney To Launch New Record Division|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-11-29/business/8903130790_1_hollywood-records-eisner-launch|accessdate=July 17, 2014|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=November 29, 1989}}</ref>  At the time, the company was limited to the release of soundtracks from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney]], [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]], and [[Hollywood Pictures]] films.

Lawyer Peter Paterno was the first president of the label, until his resignation in 1993 because of the division's lackluster sales. After failing to sign new artists such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Naughty By Nature]], [[Cypress Hill]] and [[Dr. Dre]], the label experienced its first major success in February 1990, when it acquired the North American distribution rights to [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s entire catalog for $10 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Queen Signs With Disney, Raising Hope For Cd Releases|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-09-13/features/9003160958_1_queen-catalog-reissues-international-cd-exchange|accessdate=July 17, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Los Angeles Daily News|date=September 13, 1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wilker|first1=Deborah|title=Queen Must Decide On Replacing Freddie Mercury|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-05-07/features/9202100472_1_roxy-meade-queen-freddie-mercury|accessdate=July 17, 2014|work=Sun-Sentinel|publisher=''Chicago Tribune''|date=May 7, 1992}}</ref> The deal's outlook as an important economic opportunity was immediately affected by the premature death of the band's lead vocalist [[Freddie Mercury]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/27/business/the-media-business-memo-cites-disney-records-woes.html?scp=1&sq=hollywood%20records&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; Memo Cites Disney Records' Woes | date=November 27, 1991}}</ref> although the group's catalog sales managed to successfully generate nearly $94 million in revenue for Disney from 1991 to 1995.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Philips|first1=Chuck|title=Disney Co Trouble in Tunetown : Hollywood Records Remains Hitless|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-30/business/fi-60705_1_hollywood-records|accessdate=July 17, 2014|work=Los Angeles Times|date=April 30, 1995}}</ref>

Bob Pfeifer was named President of the label in March 1995 after a whole year without a President, but problems continued to the label and Pfeifer was fired in 1997, after the label revealed that he had lost over 150 million dollars since 1989.<ref>{{cite news|title=Head of struggling Disney music unit quits: Walt Disney...|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-04-17/news/9704180160_1_calif-based-disney-pfeifer-musician-and-talent-scout|accessdate=July 17, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|date=April 17, 1997}}</ref> In 1997, Disney acquired [[Mammoth Records]], in order to get an already-established record label that could succeed. However, the acquisition of Mammoth was a failure and the label was closed and integrated to Hollywood in 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/28/business/the-corporate-wooing-and-winning-of-mammoth-records.html?scp=3&sq=hollywood%20records&st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Trip | last=Gabriel | title=The Corporate Wooing and Winning of Mammoth Records | date=July 28, 1997}}</ref> In 1998, the company decided to form Buena Vista Music Group (now Disney Music Group), integrating the operations of [[Walt Disney Records]] along with Hollywood, [[Lyric Street Records|Lyric Street]], [[Mammoth Records|Mammoth]], and Walt Disney Music Publishing. Bob Cavallo, former manager of [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] was appointed as chairman of the group, and president of Hollywood Records.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chmielewski|first1=Dawn|title=A Cinderella story for Disney Music Group|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/09/business/fi-hollywood9|accessdate=September 7, 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 9, 2007}}</ref> This movement looked to organize the music operations of the company under a more integrated direction.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50B14F73F5D0C718DDDA80894D0494D81&scp=7&sq=bob%20cavallo&st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Regrouping, Disney Music Names Chairman | date=January 12, 1998}}</ref>

After some years of development, Hollywood Records had its first major success in 2003, when [[Metamorphosis (Hilary Duff album)|Metamorphosis]], [[Hilary Duff]]'s first album was released and became a success to the label, selling over three million copies in the United States. The launch of Duff's career represents a new business model for the record, utilizing the synergies around the company, including important outlets like [[Disney Channel]] or [[Radio Disney]]. Duff's albums released under Hollywood proved to be equally successful including 2004's [[Hilary Duff (album)|Hilary Duff]] and 2005's [[Most Wanted (Hilary Duff album)|Most Wanted]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F04E4DF143EF93BA35751C0A9609C8B63&scp=5&sq=bob%20cavallo&st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Sisario | title=A Musical For Tweens Captures Its Audience | date=February 8, 2006}}</ref> A similar business model was utilized in subsequent Hollywood's artists like [[Demi Lovato]], [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]] and [[Selena Gomez]] with several productions that gained Platinum or Gold certifications. Their musical careers proved that the label had become a success. At the same time, the label continued to develop the careers of artists with a less mainstream profile like [[Grace Potter & the Nocturnals]], [[Breaking Benjamin]] or [[Plain White T's]], but who had been successful in its own terms. The label also continued to release soundtracks from films and TV shows, mainly those derived from [[Marvel Studios]] productions.

In 2010, Hollywood absorbed the remaining operations of country music label Lyric Street Records, which became an imprint for the catalog of the defunct-label, currently managed by Hollywood. In 2011, Queen left [[EMI]] for [[Universal Music Group|Universal]]-owned [[Island Records]], with Hollywood continuing to remain the group's North American music distributor.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Collett-White|first1=Mike|title=Queen Signs To Universal, Preps Remastered Albums|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/951467/queen-signs-to-universal-preps-remastered-albums|accessdate=July 17, 2014|publisher=Billboard Magazine|date=November 8, 2010}}</ref> In January 2012, after 14 years of a successful tenure, Bob Cavallo retired as chairman of the Group and Ken Bunt was appointed as president of the group. Several changes have been done under his tenure, including the retirement of long-time executives from the Cavallo's era like Abbey Konowitch, Justin Fontaine and Jon Lind and the appointment of new [[A&R]]'s like Mio Vukovic and Mike Daly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=Ken Bunt Will Run Disney Music Group In 2012 When Bob Cavallo Retires|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/ken-bunt-will-run-disney-music-group-in-2012-when-bob-cavallo-retires/|publisher=[[Deadline.com]]|accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref>

In March 2013, Disney Music Group and Universal Music Group announced the expansion of their relationship with a new commercial and creative agreement that enable Hollywood Records' artists to collaborate with the roster of producers and songwriters that are part of Universal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/detail/2457 | title= Universal Music Group (UMG) & Disney Music Group (DMG) expand agreement globally  | date=March 20, 2013}}</ref> This deal led to Hollywood becoming integrated as a division of UMG Recordings Inc. with DMG retaining corporate ownership. The exclusive deal also saw UMG granted unlimited access to all rights pertaining to Disney's 85 year back catalog of soundtracks and albums. X Factor Alum [[Beatrice Miller|Bea Miller]] was the first artist to be signed under a new joint deal with [[Syco Music]] and Hollywood in 2013.

Since 2013, Hollywood Records also uses the brand name '''DMG Nashville'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Hollywood Records, inc.|url=http://www.sos.arkansas.gov/corps/search_corps.php?DETAIL=371347&corp_type_id=1&corp_name=&agent_search=&agent_city=&agent_state=&filing_number=&cmd=|accessdate=April 13, 2015|publisher=Arkansas Secretary of State}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=See Lucy Hale Live in LA!|url=http://hollywoodrecords.com/lucyhale/iheart/|accessdate=April 13, 2015|publisher=Hollywood Records|quote=...you agree to the terms of this promotion and to receive future email updates from DMG Nashville and Lucy Hale (...) hold harmless and defend Lucy Hale, Hollywood Records, Inc., Clear Channel Broadcasting, Inc., and all of their parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and agents...}}</ref> to specialize in [[country music]].

==Hollywood Basic==
[[Image:Hollywood BASIC.jpg|right]]
'''Hollywood Basic''' was Hollywood’s short-lived hip-hop subsidiary, run by Dave Funkenklein, which existed from 1990 to 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disney’s Rap Label Shows Conviction|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-03-28/features/9101280100_1_klein-prisoners-hollywood-records|accessdate=July 17, 2014|work=Chicago Tribune|publisher=Los Angeles Daily News|date=March 28, 1991}}</ref> It did not survive the distribution transition its parent made to [[PolyGram Records]], and all of its recordings were deleted, save for those by [[Organized Konfusion]], which were repressed under the new deal. It was the first label to record [[DJ Shadow]], releasing his "Lesson 4" (a reference to [[Double Dee and Steinski]]) as the B-side of a 1991 single by Lifers' Group, a hip hop group composed of convicts serving sentences at [[Rahway Prison]] in New Jersey. It also released Shadow's Legitimate Mix on the B-side of a single by the group Zimbabwe Legit in 1992.<ref>[[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]], ''Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', 2nd ed. London: Rough Guides/Penguin Books, 2000 (p. 102).</ref> Arguably the most high-profile release was due to be ''BASIC Queen Bootlegs'', a 10-track collection of hip-hop remixes and reinterpretations of tracks by the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and featuring roster names plus guests such as [[Ice Cube]].  Although the ''BASIC Beats Sampler'' confirmed its release date for April 1992, the album was not commercially released although it has since leaked online.  Other notable releases came from [[Organized Konfusion]]; its challenging second album, ''[[Stress: The Extinction Agenda]]'' (1994), was widely acclaimed.<ref>Peter Shapiro, ''Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', 2nd ed. London: Rough Guides/Penguin Books, 2000 (p. 291).</ref> The label was also home of [[Charizma|Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf]], although, following the shooting death of Charizma in 1993, the music the duo recorded for the label was not released. This would later inspire [[Peanut Butter Wolf]] to found [[Stones Throw Records]] in order to make this music available.<ref>Peter Shapiro, ''Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', 2nd ed. London: Rough Guides/Penguin Books, 2000 (pp. 349–351).</ref> Acts on Hollywood BASIC's roster included Charizma and [[Peanut Butter Wolf]], Lifers' Group, [[Organized Konfusion]], [[Raw Fusion]], Hi-C, and Zimbabwe Legit.

==Distribution==
Upon its 1989 launch, Hollywood was distributed by [[Elektra Records]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Distribution in North America switched to [[PolyGram]] (now [[Universal Music Group]]) in 1995 (partnered with [[A&M Records|A&M]] in [[Canada]] until the formation of Universal in 1999).  Today, Universal Music Group markets and distributes Hollywood Records catalog worldwide except for [[Russia]] and [[Japan]]; [[Warner Music Group]] is the label's Russian distributor, while [[Avex]] markets and distributes Hollywood Records catalog in Japan. Also, several Hollywood artists including [[Demi Lovato]], [[Selena Gomez & the Scene]], [[Nick Jonas & the Administration]], [[Joe Jonas]], [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Jonas Brothers]] re directly signed to Universal Music UK's [[Fascination Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=UNIVERSAL MUSIC, DISNEY MUSIC FORGE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND: Forthcoming Releases Include Jonas Brothers and Hannah Montana|url=http://new.umusic.com/News.aspx?NewsId=738|publisher=[[Universal Music Group]]|accessdate=December 6, 2012}}</ref> There were reports in 2011 that Disney Music Group would start an independent US distribution arm for its label's releases,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} but as of February 2012, those plans have yet to be enacted. Universal Music Group acquired EMI in 2012 but pledged not to renew its European license with Disney; both sides eventually changed their minds.<ref>http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1084095/universal-emi-merger-approved-by-canadian-regulators</ref>
In March 2013, Disney Music Group and Universal Music Group announced the expansion of their relationship with a new commercial and creative agreement that enable Hollywood Records' artists to collaborate with the roster of producers and songwriters that are part of Universal.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.universalmusic.com/corporate/detail/2457 | title= Universal Music Group (UMG) & Disney Music Group (DMG) expand agreement globally  | date=March 20, 2013}}</ref> This deal led to Hollywood becoming integrated as a division of UMG Recordings Inc. with DMG retaining corporate ownership.
