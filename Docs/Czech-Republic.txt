The Czech state was formed in the late 9th century as the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] under the [[Great Moravia|Great Moravian Empire]]. After the fall of the Empire in 907, the centre of power transferred from Moravia to Bohemia under the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. In 1004, the duchy was formally recognized as part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]],<ref name="The Path">{{cite web|url=http://www.vlada.cz/assets/udalosti/vystavy/Cesty-ceske-ustavnosti.pdf|title=The Path of Czech Constitutionality|last1=Mlsna|first1=Petr|last2=Šlehofer|first2=F.|last3=Urban|first3=D.|year=2010|work=1st edition|publisher=Úřad Vlády České Republiky (The Office of the Government of the Czech Republic)|pages=10–11|language=Czech, English|accessdate=31 October 2012|location=Praha}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacr.cz/zpravy/zlatabula800.aspx|title=800 let Zlaté buly sicilské|last=Čumlivski|first=Denko|year=2012|publisher=National Archives of the Czech Republic (Národní Archiv České Republiky)|language=czech|accessdate=31 October 2012|archiveurl=http://www.nacr.cz/zpravy/zlatabula800.aspx|archivedate=1 October 2012}}</ref> becoming the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in 1198 and reaching its greatest territorial extent in the 14th century. Besides Bohemia itself, the [[List of Bohemian monarchs|king of Bohemia]] ruled the [[lands of the Bohemian Crown]], he had a [[Prince-elector|vote in the election of]] the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], and Prague was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century. In the [[Hussite wars]] of the 15th century driven by the [[Bohemian Reformation]], the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five [[crusades]] proclaimed by the leaders of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

Following the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] alongside the [[Archduchy of Austria]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The Protestant [[Bohemian Revolt]] (1618–20) against the Catholic [[Habsburgs]] led to the [[Thirty Years' War]], after which the monarchy consolidated its rule, reimposed Catholicism, and adopted a policy of gradual [[Germanization]]. With the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Bohemian Kingdom became part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Czech language]] experienced a revival as a consequence of widespread [[romantic nationalism]]. In the 19th century, the Czech lands became the industrial powerhouse of the monarchy and were subsequently the core of the Republic of [[Czechoslovakia]], which was formed in 1918 following the collapse of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] after World War I.

Czechoslovakia was [[German-occupied Europe|occupied by Germany]] in World War II, and was liberated in 1945 by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and the [[United States]] armies. Most of the [[Sudeten Germans|German-speaking inhabitants]] were [[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|expelled]] after the war and thus the country lost its sizable minority and its bilingual character. The [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] won the [[Czechoslovakian parliamentary election, 1946|1946 elections]]. Following the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|1948 coup d'état]], Czechoslovakia became a [[One-party state|one-party communist state]] under Soviet influence. In 1968, increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known as the [[Prague Spring]], which ended in a [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]]. Czechoslovakia remained occupied until the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]], when the communist regime collapsed and a multiparty parliamentary republic was formed. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peacefully dissolved]], with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]].

The Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] in 1999 and the [[European Union]] in 2004; it is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and the [[Council of Europe]].

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
{{Main|Name of the Czech Republic}}
The traditional English name "Bohemia" derives from Latin "Boiohaemum", which means "home of the [[Boii]]". The current name comes from the endonym ''Čech'', spelled "Cžech" until the orthographic reform in 1842.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0201690#m_en_gb0201690 |title=Oxford English Dictionary |publisher=Askoxford.com |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref><ref>
[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/czech Czech]. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary – Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved 19 November 2012.
</ref>
The name comes from the Slavic tribe (Czechs, {{lang-cs|Čechové}}) and, according to legend, their leader [[Lech, Čech, and Rus|Čech]], who brought them to Bohemia, to settle on [[Říp Mountain]]. The etymology of the word ''Čech'' can be traced back to the [[Proto-Slavic]] root ''*čel-'', meaning "member of the people; kinsman", thus making it [[cognate (linguistics)|cognate]] to the Czech word ''[[:wiktionary:člověk|člověk]]'' (a person).<ref>{{cite web|last=Spal|first=Jaromír|title=Původ jména Čech|url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=4320|publisher=Naše řeč|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

The country has been traditionally divided into three lands, namely [[Bohemia]] (''Čechy'') in the west, [[Moravia]] (''Morava'') in the southeast, and [[Czech Silesia]] (''Slezsko''; the smaller, south-eastern part of [[Silesia|historical Silesia]], most of which is located within modern Poland) in the northeast. Known as the ''lands of the Bohemian Crown'' since the 14th century, a number of other names for the country have been used, including ''Czech/Bohemian lands'', ''Bohemian Crown'', and the ''lands of the Crown of [[Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Saint Wenceslas]]''. When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]] in 1918, the new name of ''Czechoslovakia'' was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within the one country.

Following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia at the end of 1992, the Czech part of the former nation found itself without a common single-word [[geography|geographical]] name in English. The name ''Czechia'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɛ|k|i|ə}} was recommended by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Czech Republic)|Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] (minister [[Josef Zieleniec]]). In a memorandum to all Czech embassies and diplomatic missions in 1993,  the full name "Czech Republic" was recommended for use only in official documents and titles of official institutions <ref>Instructions of the Foreign Ministry of the Czech Republic (26 February 1993, ČSN ISO 3166-1; MZV č.j.81.628/98 OKKV, 17 March 1998)</ref> (cit.). The geographical name still has not reached general recognition, but its usage is increasing. It can be found in dictionaries,<ref>Josef Fronek: Velký česko-anglický slovník (second, extended release, publ.LEDA 2013, p.91) [http://www.leda.cz/Autor-info.php?jmeno=Josef-Fronek%7C97]</ref> maps, special literature,<ref>Pavlínek P., Ženka J.: The 2008–2009 automotive industry crisis and regional unemployment in Central Europe (Cambridge Journal of Regions, Economy & Society) [http://cjres.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2010/08/24/cjres.rsq026.abstract]</ref> tourist road atlases,<ref>[http://www.mapyapruvodce.cz/Index/AA/SHOCRTuristAtlas100Nahled.jpg Road atlas "Česko – Czechia – Tschechien"]</ref> maps,<ref>[http://www.mapyapruvodce.cz/Index/AA/FBCRBryleNahled.jpg Road map "Česko – Tschechien – Czechia"] (Freytag & Berndt)</ref> encyclopedias,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kosmas.cz/knihy/161920/czechia/|title=Czechia|work=Kosmas.cz – internetové knihkupectví}}</ref> media,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv-address.com/page/result/?keyword=czechia|title=Search result - www.tv-address.com|author=PTco|publisher=}}</ref> and on the web.

===Prehistory===
Archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the [[Paleolithic]] era. The figurine [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]], together with a few others from nearby locations, found here is the oldest known [[ceramic]] article in the world.

In the [[classical era]], from the 3rd century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations, the [[Boii]] and later in the 1st century, Germanic tribes of [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]] settled there. Their king [[Maroboduus]] is the first documented ruler of Bohemia. During the [[Migration Period]] around the 5th century, many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe.

[[Slavic people]] from the [[Black Sea]]–[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region settled in the area (a movement that was also stimulated by the onslaught of peoples from [[Siberia]] and Eastern Europe: [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]). In the sixth century they moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia and some of present-day Austria and Germany. During the 7th century, the Frankish merchant [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], became the ruler of the first known Slav state in Central Europe, the [[Samo's Empire]]. The Moravian principality [[Great Moravia]] arose in the 8th century and reached its zenith in the 9th, when it held off the influence of the Franks and won the protection of the Pope.

The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century, when it was unified by the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. In 10th century [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia]] conquered Moravia, Silesia and expanded farther to the east. The [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was, as the only kingdom in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. It was part of the Empire from 1002 till 1806, with the exception of the years 1440–1526.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Přemysl Ottokar I]] (bearing the title "king" since 1198) extracted the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the [[Duchy]] of Bohemia was raised to a [[Realm|Kingdom]]. The bull declared that the King of Bohemia would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in imperial councils. German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century. Germans populated towns and mining districts and, in some cases, formed German colonies in the interior of Bohemia. In 1235, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] launched an [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]]. After the [[Battle of Legnica]] in Poland, the Mongols carried their raids into Moravia, but were defensively defeated at the fortified town of [[Olomouc]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grousset |first1=René |title=The Empire of the Steppes |date=1970 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=266 |url=https://books.google.cz/books?id=CHzGvqRbV_IC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en}}</ref> The Mongols subsequently invaded and defeated Hungary.<ref>Jan Dugosz, Maurice Michael (1997) ''The Annals of Jan Dlugosz'', IM Publications, ISBN 1-901019-00-4</ref>

King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Přemysl Otakar II]] earned the nickname ''Iron and Golden King'' because of his military power and wealth. He acquired Austria, [[Styria]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Carniola]], thus spreading the Bohemian territory to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. He met his death at the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] in 1278 in a war with his rival, King [[Rudolph I of Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiv.radio.cz/history/history03.html |title=The rise and fall of the Przemyslid Dynasty |publisher=Archiv.radio.cz |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> Ottokar's son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] acquired the Polish crown in 1300 for himself and the Hungarian crown for his son. He built a great empire stretching from the [[Danube river]] to the [[Baltic Sea]]. In 1306, the last king of Přemyslid line was murdered in mysterious circumstances in Olomouc while he was resting. After a series of dynastic wars, the [[House of Luxembourg]] gained the Bohemian throne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panovnici.cz/vaclav-II-kral|title=Václav II. český král|work=panovnici.cz}}</ref>

The 14th century, in particular, the reign of the [[List of rulers of Bohemia|Bohemian king]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] (1316–1378), who in 1346 became [[King of the Romans]] and in 1354 both [[King of Italy]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor]], is considered the Golden Age of Czech history. Of particular significance was the founding of [[Charles University in Prague]] in 1348, [[Charles Bridge]], [[Charles Square]]. Much of [[Prague Castle]] and the [[cathedral of Saint Vitus]] in [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]  were completed during his reign. He unified [[Brandenburg]] (until 1415), [[Lusatia]] (until 1635), and [[Silesia]] (until 1742) under the Czech crown. The [[Black Death]], which had raged in Europe from 1347 to 1352, decimated the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1380,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/Slavonic/Czech_Hist4.html |title=The flowering and the decline of the Czech medieval state |publisher=Arts.gla.ac.uk |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> killing about 10% of the population.<ref>''"[https://books.google.com/books?id=3u3rNCWtv0MC&pg=PA49&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Plague epidemics in Czech countries]"''.

By the end of the 14th century started the process of the so-called [[Bohemian Reformation|Bohemian (Czech) Reformation]]. The religious and social reformer [[Jan Hus]] formed a reform movement later named after him. Although Hus was named a heretic and burnt in [[Konstanz|Constance]] in 1415, his followers seceded from the Catholic Church and in the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. [[Petr Chelčický]] continued with the [[Hussites|Hussite Reformation movement]]. During the next two centuries, 90% of the inhabitants became adherents of the Hussite movement. Hus's thoughts were a major influence on the later emerging [[Lutheranism]]. Luther himself said “we are all Hussites, without having been aware of it” and considered himself as Hus' direct successor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mentor and precursor of the Reformation|url=http://www.luther2017.de/en/reformation/and-its-people/jan-hus/}}</ref>

After 1526 Bohemia came increasingly under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of Bohemia. The [[Austrian Habsburgs#Division of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs|Austrian Habsburgs]] of the 16th century, the founders of the central European [[Habsburg Monarchy]], were buried in Prague. Between 1583–1611 Prague was the official seat of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and his court.

The [[Defenestrations of Prague|Defenestration of Prague]] and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the [[Thirty Years' War]], which quickly spread throughout Central Europe. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the [[Battle of White Mountain]], and the ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs' hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened. The leaders of the [[Bohemian Revolt]] were [[Old Town Square execution|executed in 1621]].

The following period, from 1620 to the late 18th century, has often been called colloquially the "Dark Age". The population of the [[Czech lands]] declined by a third through the expulsion of Czech Protestants as well as due to the war, disease and famine.<ref>Oskar Krejčí, Martin C.

The reigns of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and co-regent from 1765, were characterized by [[enlightened absolutism]]. In 1740, most of Silesia (except the southernmost area) was seized by King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the [[Silesian Wars]]. In 1757 the Prussians invaded Bohemia and after the [[Battle of Prague (1757)]] occupied the city. More than one quarter of Prague was destroyed and [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] also suffered heavy damage. However, soon after, at the [[Battle of Kolín]] Frederick was defeated and had to leave Prague and retreat from Bohemia. In 1770 and 1771 [[Famines in Czech lands|Great Famine]] killed about one tenth of the Czech population, or 250,000 inhabitants, and radicalised the countryside leading to peasant uprisings.<ref>"''The Cambridge economic history of Europe: The economic organization of early modern Europe''".

The end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806 led to degradation of the political status of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Bohemia lost its position of an [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the Holy Roman Empire as well as its own political representation in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hlavačka|first1=Milan|title=Formování moderního českého národa 1815–1914|journal=Historický obzor|date=2009|volume=20|issue=9/10|page=195|language=Czech}}</ref> Bohemian lands became part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and later of [[Austria–Hungary]]. During the 18th and 19th century the [[Czech National Revival]] began its rise, with the purpose to revive Czech language, culture and national identity. The [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|Revolution of 1848]] in Prague, striving for liberal reforms and autonomy of the Bohemian Crown within the Austrian Empire, was suppressed. In 1866 Austria was defeated by Prussia in the [[Austro-Prussian War]]. The Austrian Empire needed to redefine itself to maintain unity in the face of nationalism. At first it seemed that some concessions would be made also to Bohemia, but in the end the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] effected a compromise with Hungary only. The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] and the never realized coronation of Franz Joseph as King of Bohemia led to a huge disappointment of Czech politicians.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=Laurence|editor2-last=Unowsky|editor2-first=David|title=The Limits of Loyalty: Imperial Symbolism, Popular Allegiances, and State Patriotism in the Late Habsburg Monarchy|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York, Oxford|url=http://www.brad.ac.uk/ssis/media/ssis/ceer/2013/Guyver_Cole-and-Unowsky.pdf|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref> The Bohemian Crown lands became part of the so-called [[Cisleithania]] (officially "The Kingdoms and Lands represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]]").

===Czechoslovakia===

{{Main|History of Czechoslovakia}}
An estimated 1.4 million Czech soldiers fought in World War I, of whom some 150,000 died. Although the majority of Czech soldiers fought for the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], more than 90,000 Czech volunteers formed the [[Czechoslovak Legion]]s in France, Italy and Russia, where they fought against the [[Central Powers]] and later against [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/zpravy/105664|title=Radio Praha – zprávy|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref> In 1918, during the collapse of the Habsburg Empire at the end of World War I, the independent republic of [[Czechoslovakia]], which joined the winning Allied powers, was created. This new country incorporated the [[Bohemian Crown]] (Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) and parts of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (Slovakia and the [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]) with significant [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918–1938)|German]], [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarian]], [[Polish minority in the Czech Republic|Polish]] and [[Ruthenia]]n speaking minorities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tab. 3 Národnost československých státních příslušníků podle žup a zemí k 15.2.1921|url=http://www.czso.cz/sldb/sldb.nsf/i/8BE4678613181F2AC1256E66004C77DD/$File/tab3_21.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Czech Statistical Office]]|language=Czech|accessdate=2 June 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070605105429/http://www.czso.cz/sldb/sldb.nsf/i/8BE4678613181F2AC1256E66004C77DD/$File/tab3_21.pdf |archivedate = 5 June 2007}}</ref>

In 1929 compared to 1913, the gross domestic product increased by 52% and industrial production by 41%. In 1938 Czechoslovakia held a 10th place in the world industrial production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blisty.cz/art/59458.html |title=Ekonomika ČSSR v letech padesátých a šedesátých |publisher=Blisty.cz |date=21 August 1968 |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Czechoslovakia I.png|thumb|left|270px|The interwar [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]]]]
Although Czechoslovakia was a [[unitary state]], it provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of Europe in the interwar period. The effects of the [[Great Depression]] including high unemployment and massive propaganda from Nazi Germany, however, resulted in discontent and strong support among ethnic Germans for a break from Czechoslovakia.

[[Adolf Hitler]] took advantage of this opportunity and, using [[Konrad Henlein]]'s separatist [[Sudeten German Party]], gained the largely German speaking [[Sudetenland]] (and its substantial [[Maginot Line]]-like [[Czechoslovak border fortifications|border fortifications]]) through the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]] (signed by [[Nazi Germany]], France, Britain and Italy). Czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference, therefore in fact betrayed by the United Kingdom and France, so Czechs and Slovaks call the Munich Agreement the [[Western betrayal|Munich Betrayal]] because the Western powers decided to give up Czechoslovakia instead of facing Hitler, which later proved inevitable. All that despite the fact that Czechoslovakia had alliance agreement with France.

Despite the mobilization of 1.2 million-strong Czechoslovak army and the Franco-Czech military alliance, Poland annexed the [[Zaolzie]] area around [[Český Těšín]]; Hungary gained parts of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus as a result of the [[First Vienna Award]] in November 1938. The remainders of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus gained greater autonomy, with the state renamed to "Czecho-Slovakia". After Nazi Germany threatened to annex part of Slovakia, allowing the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary and Poland, Slovakia chose to maintain its national and territorial integrity, seceding from Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939, and allying itself, as demanded by Germany, with Hitler's coalition.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''The Foreign Policy of Hitler's Germany: Starting World War II, 1937–1939'' (Chicago, 1980), pp. 470–481.</ref>

The remaining Czech territory was occupied by Germany, which transformed it into the so-called [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The protectorate was proclaimed part of the Third Reich, and the president and prime minister were subordinated to the Nazi Germany's ''[[Protector (title)|Reichsprotektor]]''. Subcarpathian Rus declared independence as the Republic of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] on 15 March 1939 but was invaded by Hungary the same day and formally annexed the next day. Approximately 345,000 Czechoslovak citizens, including 277,000 Jews, were killed or executed while hundreds of thousands of others were sent to prisons and [[Nazi concentration camps]] or used as forced labour. Up to two-thirds of the citizens were in groups targeted by the Nazis for deportation or death.<ref>Stephen A. Garrett (1996).

[[File:Prague liberation 1945 konev.jpg|thumb|[[Prague]] liberated by [[Red Army]] in May 1945]]
There was [[Czech resistance to Nazi occupation]], both at home and abroad, most notably with the [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Nazi German leader]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] by Czechoslovakian soldiers [[Jozef Gabčík]] and [[Jan Kubiš]] in a Prague suburb on 27 May 1942. On 9 June 1942 Hitler ordered bloody reprisals against the Czechs as a response to the Czech anti-Nazi resistance. The [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia#Czechoslovak Government-in-Exile|Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] and its army fought against the Germans and were acknowledged by the Allies; Czech/Czechoslovak troops fought from the very beginning of the war in Poland, France, the UK, North Africa, the Middle East and the Soviet Union. The German occupation ended on 9 May 1945, with the arrival of the Soviet and American armies and the [[Prague uprising]]. An estimated 140,000 Soviet soldiers died in liberating Czechoslovakia from German rule.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&pg=PA409&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false A Companion to Russian History]''". Abbott Gleason (2009). Wiley-Blackwell. p.409. ISBN 1-4051-3560-3</ref>

In 1945–1946, almost the entire German-speaking minority in Czechoslovakia, about 3 million people, [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II#Czechoslovakia|were expelled]] to Germany and Austria. During this time, thousands of Germans were held in prisons and detention camps or used as forced labour. In the summer of 1945, there were several massacres. The only Germans not expelled were some 250,000 who had been active in the resistance against the Nazi Germans or were considered economically important, though many of these emigrated later. Following a Soviet-organised referendum, the Subcarpathian Rus never returned under Czechoslovak rule but became part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], as the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] in 1946.

Czechoslovakia uneasily tried to play the role of a "bridge" between the West and East. However, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] rapidly increased in popularity, with a general disillusionment with the West, because of the pre-war [[Munich Agreement]], and a favourable popular attitude towards the Soviet Union, because of the Soviets' role in liberating Czechoslovakia from German rule. In the [[Czechoslovakian parliamentary election, 1946|1946 elections]], the Communists gained 38%<ref>F. Čapka: [http://www.libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t98.html Dějiny zemí Koruny české v datech].

They formed a coalition government with other parties of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] and moved quickly to consolidate power. A significant change came in 1948 with [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup d'état by the Communist Party]]. The Communist [[People's Militias (Czechoslovakia)|People's Militias]] secured control of key locations in Prague, and a single party government was formed.

[[File:10 Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|The [[Prague Spring]] political liberalization of the communist regime was stopped by the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]]]
For the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|next 41 years]], Czechoslovakia was a Communist state within the [[Eastern Bloc]]. This period is characterized by lagging behind the West in almost every aspect of social and economic development. The country's GDP per capita fell from the level of neighboring Austria below that of Greece or Portugal in the 1980s. The Communist government completely [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the [[means of production]] and established a [[Planned economy|command economy]]. The economy grew rapidly during the 1950s but slowed down in the 1960s and 1970s and stagnated in the 1980s. The political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s, including numerous [[show trial]]s and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners, but became more open and tolerant in the late 1960s, culminating in [[Alexander Dubček]]'s leadership in the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], which tried to create "socialism with a human face" and perhaps even introduce political [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. This was forcibly ended by [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] by all [[Warsaw Pact]] member countries with the exception of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] on 21 August 1968.

The invasion was followed by a harsh program of "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]" in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Until 1989, the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition. Dissidents published [[Charter 77]] in 1977, and the first of a new wave of protests were seen in 1988. Between 1948 and 1989 more than 250,000 Czechs and Slovaks were sent to prison, and over 400,000 emigrated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4388764.stm|title=Czech schools revisit communism|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

{{Main|Velvet Revolution|Dissolution of Czechoslovakia}}

In November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful "[[Velvet Revolution]]". However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened and on 1 January 1993, the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|country peacefully split]] into the independent Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]]. Both countries went through economic reforms and [[privatisation]]s, with the intention of creating a [[market economy]]. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognised by the World Bank as a "developed country",<ref name="worldbank06"/> and in 2009 the [[Human Development Index]] ranked it as a nation of "Very High Human Development".<ref name="hdi09">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2009|work=UNDP.org |format=PDF |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

From 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right, has been a member of the [[Visegrád Group]] and from 1995, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. The Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999 and the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004. On 21 December 2007 the Czech Republic joined the [[Schengen Area]].

The [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]] (''Parlament České republiky'') is bicameral, with the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] ({{lang-cs|Poslanecká sněmovna}}) (200 members) and the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] ({{lang-cs|Senát}}) (81 members).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psp.cz/en/docs/laws/constitution.html |title=The Constitution of the Czech Republic – Article 16 |publisher=Czech Republic |accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref>

The president is a formal [[head of state]] with limited and specific powers, most importantly to return bills to the parliament, appoint members to the board of the [[Czech National Bank]], nominate [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|constitutional court]] judges for the Senate's approval and dissolve the Chamber of Deputies under certain special and unusual circumstances. The president and vice president of the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic|Supreme Court]] are appointed by the President of the Republic. He also appoints the prime minister, as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister. From 1993 until 2012, the [[President of the Czech Republic]] was selected by a joint session of the parliament for a five-year term, with no more than two consecutive terms.  Since 2013 the presidential election is direct.

The members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]], with a 5% [[election threshold]]. There are 14 voting districts, identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, the successor to the [[Czech National Council]], has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former Czechoslovakia.

[[File:Czechpolsystem.png|thumbnail|right|450px|The political system of the Czech Republic]]
The members of the Senate are elected in single-seat [[electoral district|constituencies]] by two-round [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] for a six-year term, with one-third elected every even year in the autumn. The first election was in 1996, for differing terms. This arrangement is modeled on the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two-round runoff. The Senate is unpopular among the public and suffers from low election turnout.{{citation needed|reason=No polls, analysis or comments provided|date=August 2015}}

===Administrative divisions===
{{see also|Regions of the Czech Republic|List of districts of the Czech Republic}}
Since 2000, the Czech Republic has been divided into [[Regions of the Czech Republic|thirteen regions]] ([[Czech language|Czech]]: [[wikt:en:kraj#Czech|''kraje'', singular ''kraj'']]) and the capital city of [[Prague]]. Every region has its own elected regional assembly (''krajské zastupitelstvo'') and ''hejtman'' (a regional governor). In Prague, the assembly and presidential powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.

The older seventy-six [[List of districts of the Czech Republic|districts]] (''okresy'', singular ''[[okres]]'') including three "statutory cities" (without Prague, which had special status) lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/36046|title=The death of the districts|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{See also|Geography of the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Satellite image of Czech Republic in September 2003.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the Czech Republic]]
The Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes [[48th parallel north|48°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]] (a small area lies north of 51°), and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]].

The Czech landscape is exceedingly varied. [[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkonoše]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sněžka]] at {{convert|1602|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also quite hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder|Oder River]] ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).

[[File:Národní park Podyjí Dyje Nationalpark Thayatal 2013 10 a.jpg|thumb|left|[[Podyjí National Park]] is one of four [[Protected areas of the Czech Republic|national parks]].]]
Water from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|sing=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Western European broadleaf forests]], Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.

There are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is
[[Krkonoše National Park]] ([[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserve]]), [[Šumava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), [[Podyjí National Park]], [[Bohemian Switzerland]].

The three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly the core countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond almost prefectly with the river basins of the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory).

===Climate===
[[File:Czech Republic map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Czech Republic map of Köppen climate classification.]]
[[File:Beskid Śląsko-Morawski - panorama 2-edit.jpg|thumb|500px|right|[[Moravian-Silesian Beskids]]]]

The Czech Republic has a temperate [[continental climate]], with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. The temperature difference between summer and winter is relatively high, due to the landlocked geographical position.<ref>R. Tolasz, ''Climate Atlas of the Czech Republic'', Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, Prague, 2007. ISBN 80-244-1626-3, graphs 1.5 and 1.6</ref>

Within the Czech Republic, temperatures vary greatly, depending on the elevation. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[Bílý Potok (Liberec District)|Bílý Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of [[Prague]]. Another important factor is the distribution of the mountains; therefore, the climate is quite varied.
[[File:Kralicky-Sneznik-03.jpg|thumb|left|Rolling hills of [[Králický Sněžník]]]]
At the highest peak of [[Sněžka]] ({{convert|1602|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=or}}), the average temperature is only {{convert|-0.4|C|F|0}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, [[Prague]], has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.

The coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is usually snow in the mountains and sometimes in the major cities and lowlands. During March, April and May, the temperature usually increases rapidly, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary widely during the day. Spring is also characterized by high water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.

The warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about {{convert|20|°C|0}} – {{convert|30|C|F}} higher than during winter. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.

[[File:Podzim na Kašperku.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bohemian Forest]] foothills, southwestern Bohemia]]
Autumn generally begins in September, which is still relatively warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below {{convert|15|C|F}} or {{convert|10|C|F}} and [[deciduous|deciduous trees]] begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point.

The coldest temperature ever measured was in Litvínovice near [[České Budějovice]] in 1929, at {{convert|-42.2|C|F}} and the hottest measured, was at {{convert|40.4|C|F}} in [[Dobřichovice]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Czech absolute record temperature registered near Prague|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-absolute-record-temperature-registered-near-prague/830626|work=České noviny|publisher=ČTK|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>

Most rain falls during the summer. Sporadic rainfall is relatively constant throughout the year (in Prague, the average number of days per month experiencing at least 0.1&nbsp;mm of rain varies from 12 in September and October to 16 in November) but concentrated heavy rainfall (days with more than 10&nbsp;mm per day) are more frequent in the months of May to August (average around two such days per month).<ref>R.

Production of Czech electricity exceeds consumption by about 10 TWh per year, which are exported. [[Nuclear power]] presently provides about 30 percent of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40 percent. In 2005, 65.4 percent of electricity was produced by steam and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30 percent by [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]]; and 4.6 percent from renewable sources, including hydropower. The largest Czech power resource is [[Temelín Nuclear Power Station]], another [[nuclear power plant]] is in [[Dukovany Nuclear Power Station|Dukovany]].

The Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade [[Lignite|brown coal]] as a source of energy. Natural gas is procured from Russian [[Gazprom]], roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption and from [[Norway|Norwegian]] companies, which make up most of the remaining one-fourth. Russian gas is imported via Ukraine ([[Druzhba pipeline]]), Norwegian gas is transported through Germany. Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003–2005) is almost double electricity consumption. South Moravia has small [[Oil and gas deposits in the Czech Republic|oil and gas deposits]].

Government-owned [[Český Telecom]] slowed down broadband penetration. At the beginning of 2004, [[local-loop unbundling]] began and alternative operators started to offer [[ADSL]] and also [[Symmetric digital subscriber line|SDSL]]. This and later privatisation of Český Telecom helped drive down prices.

On 1 July 2006, Český Telecom was acquired by globalized company (Spain owned) Telefónica group and adopted new name [[Telefónica O2 Czech Republic]]. As of June 2014, VDSL and ADSL2+ are offered in many variants, with download speeds of up to 40 Mbit/s and upload speeds of up to 2Mbit/s. Cable internet is gaining popularity with its higher download speeds ranging from 2 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s.

Czechia is known worldwide for its individually made, mouth blown and decorated art glass and crystal. One of the best Czech painters and decorative artists was [[Alphonse Mucha]] (1860–1939) mainly known for [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] posters and his cycle of 20 large canvases named [[the Slav Epic]], which depicts the history of Czechs and other [[Slavs]]. {{As of|2012}}, [[the Slav Epic]] can be seen in the Veletržní Palace of the [[National Gallery in Prague]], which manages the largest collection of art in Czechia.

===Architecture===
{{Main|Czech Gothic architecture|Czech Renaissance architecture|Czech Baroque architecture}}
The earliest preserved stone buildings in Bohemia and Moravia date back to the time of the [[Christianization]] in the 9th and 10th century. Since the Middle Ages Czechia has been using the same architectural styles as most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]]. The oldest still standing churches were built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]]. During the 13th century it was replaced by the [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]]. In the 14th century Emperor Charles IV invited to his court in Prague talented architects from France and Germany, [[Matthias of Arras]] and [[Peter Parler]]. During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as many monasteries. During the [[Hussite wars]], many of them were damaged or destroyed.

[[File:Letohrádek královny Anny by Crazyspeak (2).jpg|thumb|left|Royal Summer Palace in Prague considered the purest Renaissance architecture outside Italy<ref name=guide>{{cite book|title=Prague : City Guidebook|date=2000|publisher=Kartografie|location=Prague|isbn=80-7011-597-1|page=40|edition=1st}}</ref>]]
The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be slowly mixed with Renaissance elements (architects [[Matěj Rejsek]], [[Benedikt Rejt]]). An outstanding example of the pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the [[Royal Summer Palace (Prague)|Royal Summer Palace]], which was situated in a newly established garden of [[Prague Castle]]. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving a massive influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious châteaux with elegant arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens.<ref name=architecture>{{cite web|title=History of Czech Architecture|url=http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|website=eu2009.cz|publisher=Czech Presidency of the European Union|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.<ref name=czecharchitecture>{{cite web|title=The History of Architecture|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|website=www.czech.cz|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Věž a kupole kostela sv. Mikuláše na Malé Straně v Praze.jpg|thumb|[[St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana)|St. Nicholas’ Church]] in Prague, a magnificent exemplar of the Bohemian Baroque]]
In the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia. Very outstanding are the architectural projects of the Czech nobleman and imperial generalissimo [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] from the 1620s. His architects [[Andrea Spezza]] and [[Giovanni de Galliano Pieroni|Giovanni Pieroni]] reflected the most recent Italian production and were very innovative at the same time. [[Czech Baroque architecture]] is considered to be a unique part of the European cultural heritage thanks to its extensiveness and extraordinariness. In the first third of the 18th century the Bohemian lands were one of the leading artistic centers of the Baroque style. In Bohemia there was completed the development of the Radical Baroque style created in Italy by [[Francesco Borromini]] and [[Guarino Guarini]] in a very original way.<ref name=kotalik>{{cite book|last=Kotalík|first=Jiří|title=Architektura barokní|year=2002|publisher=Správa Pražského hradu a DaDa|location=Praha|isbn=80-86161-38-2|page=13|edition=Deset století architektury|language=Czech}}</ref> Leading architects of the Bohemian Baroque were [[Jean Baptiste Mathey|Jean-Baptiste Mathey]], [[František Maxmilián Kaňka]], [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]], and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]].

[[File:Church of St John of Nepomuk at Zelená hora CZ.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk]] by [[Jan Blažej Santini-Aichel|Santini]]]]
In the 18th century Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity – the ''Baroque Gothic style'', a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles. This was not a simple return to Gothic details, but rather an original Baroque transformation. The main representative and originator of this style was [[Jan Blažej Santini-Aichel]], who used this style in renovating medieval monastic buildings.<ref name=architecture/>

During the 19th century, the [[Revival architecture|revival architectural styles]] were very popular in the Bohemian monarchy. Many churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed many new buildings in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] styles. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the new art style appeared in the Czech lands – [[Art Nouveau]]. The best-known representatives of Czech Art Nouveau architecture were [[Osvald Polívka]], who designed the [[Municipal House]] in Prague, [[Josef Fanta]], the architect of the [[Praha hlavní nádraží|Prague Main Railway Station]], and [[Jan Kotěra]].

Bohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the [[Cubism]] of painting and sculpture into architecture. During the first years of the independent Czechoslovakia (after 1918), a specifically Czech architectural style, called ''‘Rondo-Cubism’'', came into existence. Together with the pre-war [[Cubism#Czech Cubist architecture|Czech Cubist architecture]] it is unparalleled elsewhere in the world. The first Czechoslovak president [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]] invited the prominent [[Slovenia|Slovene]] architect [[Jože Plečnik]] to Prague, where he modernized the [[Prague Castle|Castle]] and built some other buildings. Between World Wars I and II, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style in the newly established Czechoslovak Republic. In the city of Brno, one of the most impressive functionalist works has been preserved – [[Villa Tugendhat]], designed by the architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=architecture/> The most significant Czech architects of this era were [[Adolf Loos]], [[Pavel Janák]] and [[Josef Gočár]].

[[File:PG07ME957 edit.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dancing House]] in Prague]]
After the World War II and the Communist coup in 1948 the art in Czechoslovakia came under the strong Soviet influence. [[Hotel International Prague|Hotel International]] in Prague is a brilliant example of the so-called [[Socialist realism]], the Stalinistic art style of the 1950s. Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement known as the ''[[Brussels style]]'' (called after the Brussels World's Fair [[Expo 58]]) became popular in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s.

Even today, the Czech Republic is not shying away from the most modern trends of international architecture. This fact is attested to by a number of projects by world-renowned architects ([[Frank Gehry]], [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Ricardo Bofill]], and [[John Pawson]]). There are also contemporary Czech architects whose works can be found all over the world ([[Eva Jiřičná]], [[Jan Kaplický]]).<ref name=architecture/>

===Literature===
{{Main|Czech literature}}
[[File:Kafka portrait.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Franz Kafka]]]]
[[Czech literature]] is the literature written by [[Czechs]], mostly in the [[Czech language]], although other languages like [[Old Church Slavonic]], [[Latin]] or German have been also used, such as by author [[Franz Kafka]], who—while bilingual in Czech and German{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164–210}}—wrote his works in German, during the era of Austrian rule.

Influential Czech authors who wrote in Latin include [[Cosmas of Prague]] († 1125), [[Peter of Zittau]] († 1339), [[Jan Hus|John Hus]] († 1415), [[Bohuslav Hasištejnský z Lobkovic]] (1461–1510), [[Jan Dubravius]] (1486–1553), [[Tadeáš Hájek]] (1525–1600), [[Johannes Vodnianus Campanus]] (1572–1622), and [[Bohuslav Balbín]] (1621–1688). In the late 13th century the royal court in Prague was one of the centers of German [[Minnesang]]. The most famous Czech medieval German-language work is the ''Ploughman of Bohemia'' (''[[Der Ackermann aus Böhmen]]''), written around 1401 by [[Johannes von Tepl]]. The heyday of Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century, which is represented by the well-known names of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Max Brod]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Egon Kisch|Egon Erwin Kisch]], and others.

The [[Bible translations into Czech|Bible translations]] played an important role in the development of Czech literature and standard Czech language. The oldest Czech translation of the [[Psalms]] originated in the late 13th century and the first Czech translation of the whole Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488 ([[Prague Bible]]). The first complete Czech Bible translation from original languages was published between 1579–93 and is known as the [[Bible of Kralice]].

Czech-language literature can be divided into several main time periods: the Middle Ages ([[Chronicle of Dalimil]]); the Hussite period ([[Tomáš Štítný ze Štítného]], [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chelčický]]); the [[Renaissance humanism]] ([[Henry the Younger of Poděbrady]], [[Luke of Prague]], [[Wenceslaus Hajek]], [[Jan Blahoslav]], [[Daniel Adam z Veleslavína]]); the Baroque period ([[John Amos Comenius]], [[Adam Václav Michna z Otradovic]], [[Bedřich Bridel]], [[Jan František Beckovský]]); the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the 19th century ([[Václav Matěj Kramerius]], [[Karel Hynek Mácha]], [[Karel Jaromír Erben]], [[Karel Havlíček Borovský]], [[Božena Němcová]], [[Jan Neruda]], [[Alois Jirásek]]); the avant-garde of the interwar period ([[Karel Čapek]], [[Jaroslav Hašek]], [[Vítězslav Nezval]], [[Jaroslav Seifert]], [[Bohuslav Reynek]]); the years under Communism and the Prague Spring ([[Josef Škvorecký]], [[Bohumil Hrabal]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[Arnošt Lustig]], [[Václav Havel]]); and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic ([[Ivan Martin Jirous]]).

[[Jaroslav Seifert]] was the only Czech writer awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. A famous antiwar comedy novel ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'' by [[Jaroslav Hašek]] is the most translated Czech book in history. It was depicted by [[Karel Steklý]] in two color films ''[[The Good Soldier Schweik (1956 film)|The Good Soldier Schweik]]'' in 1956 and 1957.

Czech literature and culture played a major role on at least two occasions, when Czechs lived under oppression and political activity was suppressed. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Music===
[[File:Dvorak.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Antonín Dvořák]]]]
{{Main|Music of the Czech Lands|Moravian traditional music}}

The musical tradition of Czechia arose from first church hymns, whose first evidence is suggested at the break of 10th and 11th century. The first significant pieces of Czech music include two chorales, which in their time performed the function of anthems: "Hospodine pomiluj ny" ([[Lord, Have Mercy on Us]]) from around 1050, unmistakably the oldest and most faithfully preserved popular spiritual song to have survived to the present, and the [[hymn]] "Svatý Václave" ([[Saint Wenceslas]]) or "[[Saint Wenceslas Chorale]]" from around 1250.<ref>The chronicles of Beneš Krabice of Veitmil – the hymn "Svatý Václave" mentioned there as old and well-known in the end of the 13th century [http://www.clavmon.cz/clavis/FRRB/chronica/CRONICA%20ECCLESIAE%20PRAGENSIS.htm]</ref> Its roots can be found in the 12th century and it still belongs to the most popular religious songs to this day. In 1918, in the beginning of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] state, the song was discussed as one of the possible choices for the national anthem. The authorship of the anthem "Lord, Have Mercy on Us" is ascribed by some historians to [[Saint Adalbert of Prague]] (sv.Vojtěch), bishop of [[Prague]], living between 956 and 997.<ref>Dějiny české hudby v obrazech (History of Czech music in pictures); in Czech</ref>
[[File:Prague Municipal Smetana Hall.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Smetana Hall in [[Prague]], one of the main venues in the annual Prague Spring Festival]] 
The wealth of musical culture in the Czech Republic lies in the long-term high-culture classical music tradition during all historical periods, especially in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical period (music)|Classicism]], [[Romantic music|Romantic]], [[Modernism (music)|modern classical]] music and in the [[traditional music|traditional]] folk music of Bohemia, Moravia and [[Silesia]]. Since the early eras of artificial music, Czech musicians and composers have often been influenced by genuine folk music (e.g. [[polka]] which originated in Bohemia). Among the most notable Czech composers are [[Adam Michna]], [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]], [[Johann Stamitz|Jan Václav Antonín Stamic]], [[Jiří Antonín Benda]], [[Johann Baptist Wanhal|Jan Křtitel Vaňhal]], [[Josef Mysliveček]], [[Anton Reicha|Antonín Rejcha]], [[Bedřich Smetana]], [[Antonín Dvořák]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]], [[Leoš Janáček]], [[Bohuslav Martinů]], [[Alois Hába]], [[Miloslav Kabeláč]] and [[Petr Eben]], not forgetting the famous musicians and interpreters, e.g. [[František Benda]], [[Jan Kubelík]], [[Emma Destinnová]], [[Rudolf Firkušný]], [[Czech Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Panocha Quartet]] and many others.

Czech music can be considered to have been beneficial in both the European and worldwide context, several times co-determined or even determined a newly arriving era in musical art,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expats.cz/prague/article/czech-culture/czech-music-history/|title=Czech Music|publisher=}}</ref> above all of [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] era, as well as by original attitudes in [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]], [[Romantic (music)|Romantic]] and [[modern classical]] music.

The most famous music festival in the country is [[Prague Spring International Music Festival]] of [[classical music]], a permanent showcase for outstanding performing artists, symphony orchestras and chamber music ensembles of the world.

The Czech Republic first entered the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007]]. They qualified for the grand final for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016|2016]] when they finished in 25th place.

===Theatre===
{{Main|Theatre of the Czech Republic}}

The roots of Czech theatre can be found in the Middle Ages, especially in cultural life of [[gothic period]]. In the 19th century, the theatre played an important role in the national awakening movement and later, in the 20th century it became a part of the modern European theatre art. Original Czech cultural phenomenon came into being at the end of the 1950s. This project called [[Laterna magika]] (The Magic Lantern) was the brainchild of renowned film and theater director [[Alfred Radok]], resulting in productions that combined theater, dance and film in a poetic manner, considered the first [[multimedia art]] project in international context

===Film===
{{Main|Cinema of the Czech Republic}}
The tradition of Czech cinematography started in the second half of 1890s. Peaks of the production in the era of silent movies represent historical [[drama]] "The Builder of the Temple", social and erotic (very controversial and innovative at that time ) drama "Erotikon" directed by [[Gustav Machatý]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/06/gustav-machatys-erotikon-1929-ekstase-1933-cinemas-earliest-explorations-of-womens-sensuality.html|title=Gustav Machatý’s Erotikon (1929) & Ekstase (1933): Cinema’s Earliest Explorations of Women’s Sensuality|work=Open Culture}}</ref> Early sound film era of Czech film was very productive, above all in mainstream genres with special role of comedies by [[Martin Frič]] or [[Karel Lamač]], however more internationally 
successful were drammatic movies, above all famous [[romantic drama]] film "[[Ecstasy (film)|Ecstasy]]" by Gustav Machatý, and romantic "The River" by  [[Josef Rovenský]].

This project called [[Laterna magika]] (The Magic Lantern), resulting in productions that combined theater, dance and film in a poetic manner, considered the first [[multimedia art]] project in international context (mentioned also in "Theatre section" above).

In 1960s, so called Czech New Wave (also [[Czechoslovak New Wave]]) received international acclaim. It is linked with names of [[Miloš Forman]], [[Věra Chytilová]], [[Jiří Menzel]], [[Ján Kadár]], [[Elmar Klos]], [[Evald Schorm]], [[Vojtěch Jasný]], [[Ivan Passer]], [[Jan Schmidt]], [[Juraj Herz]], [[Jan Němec]], Jaroslav Papoušek, etc. The hallmark of the films of this movement were long, often improvised [[dialogue]]s, [[Black humour|black]] and [[absurdity|absurd]] [[humor]] and the occupation of non-actors. Directors are trying to preserve natural atmosphere wthout refinement and artificial arrangement of scenes. The unique personality of 1960s and the beginning of 1970s with original manuscript, deep psychological impact and extraordinarily high quality art is the director [[František Vláčil]]. His films [[Marketa Lazarová]], [[Údolí včel]] ("The Valley of The Bees") or [[Adelheid]] belong to the srtistic peaks of Czech cinema production. The film "Marketa Lazarová" was voted the all-time best Czech movie in a prestigious 1998 poll of Czech film critics and publicists. Another internationally well-known author is [[Jan Švankmajer]] (in the beginning of the career conjoined with above mentioned project "Laterna Magika"), a filmmaker and artist whose work spans several media. He is a self-labeled [[surrealism|surrealist]] known for his [[animation]]s and features, which have greatly influenced many artists worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|title= Brooding Cartoons From Jan Svankmajer |publisher= LA Times|date=19 July 1991|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-19/entertainment/ca-2291_1_political-cartoon|accessdate=24 August 2010 | first=Charles | last=Solomon}}</ref>

===Media===
Since the Czech Republic is a democratic republic, journalists and media should be free to write about everything, except supporting [[nazism]], [[racism]] and violating the [[Czech law]].

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Czech cuisine}}

Czech cuisine is marked by a strong emphasis on meat dishes. Pork is quite common; beef and chicken are also popular. Goose, duck, rabbit and wild game are served. Fish is rare, with the occasional exception of fresh [[trout]] and [[carp]], which is served at Christmas.

[[Beer in the Czech Republic|Czech beer]] has a long and important history. The first brewery is known to have existed in 993 and the Czech Republic has the highest [[List of countries by beer consumption per capita|beer consumption per capita]] in the world. The famous "[[Pilsner|pilsner style]] [[beer]]" (pils) originated in the western Bohemian city of [[Plzeň]], where the world's first-ever blond lager [[Pilsner Urquell]] is still being produced, making it the inspiration for more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today. Further south the town of [[České Budějovice]], known as Budweis in German, lent its name to its beer, eventually known as [[Budweiser Budvar]]. Apart from these and other major brands, the Czech Republic also boasts a growing number of top quality small breweries and mini-breweries seeking to continue the age-old tradition of quality and taste, whose output matches the best in the world.

Tourism is slowly growing around the Southern Moravian region too, which has been producing [[Czech wine|wine]] since the Middle Ages; about 94% of [[vineyard]]s in the Czech Republic are Moravian. Aside from [[slivovitz]], Czech beer and wine, the Czechs also produce two unique [[liquor]]s, [[Fernet Stock]] and [[Becherovka]]. [[Kofola]] is a non-alcoholic domestic [[cola]] [[soft drink]] which competes with [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] in popularity.

Some popular Czech dishes include:

* ''Vepřo knedlo zelo'': roast pork with bread dumplings and stewed cabbage
* ''[[Svíčková|Svíčková na smetaně]]'': roast sirloin of beef with steamed dumplings and cream of vegetable sauce
* ''Rajská (omáčka)'': beef in tomato sauce, traditionally served with dumplings
* ''Koprovka'': beef in dill sauce, traditionally served with dumplings
* ''Pečená kachna'': roast duck with bread or potato dumplings and braised red cabbage
* ''[[Guláš]]'': a variety of beef and pork goulash stews, served with dumplings or bread
* ''[[Smažený sýr]]'': fried cheese, typically served with potatoes or french fries and [[tartar sauce]]
* ''[[Potato pancake|Bramboráky]]'': potato pancakes, traditionally served with sour cabbage

There is also a large variety of local sausages, wurst, pâtés, and smoked and cured meats. Czech desserts include a wide variety of whipped cream, chocolate, and fruit pastries and tarts, crêpes, creme desserts and cheese, poppy seed filled and other types of traditional cakes such as ''[[Buchteln|buchty]]'', ''[[Kolach|koláč]]e'' and [[Apple strudel|''štrůdl'']].

===Sports===
[[File:HC LEV Record O2.jpg|thumb|Ice hockey is one of the most popular sports in the Czech Republic and the Czech national team is one of the [[Big Six (ice hockey)|world's best teams]]]]{{Main|Sport in the Czech Republic}}
Sports play a part in the life of many Czechs, who are generally loyal supporters of their favorite teams or individuals. The two leading sports in the Czech Republic are [[ice hockey]] and [[association football|football]]. Tennis is also a very popular sport in the Czech Republic. The many other sports with professional leagues and structures include basketball, volleyball, [[team handball]], [[track and field athletics]] and [[floorball]]. [[Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team|The Czech ice hockey team]] won the gold medal at the [[1998 Winter Olympics]] and has won twelve gold medals at the [[IHWC|World Championships]] (including 6 as Czechoslovakia), including three straight from [[1999 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|1999]] to [[2001 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2001]]. In total the country has won 14 gold medals in [[Summer Olympic Games|summer]] (plus 49 as Czechoslovakia) and five gold medals (plus two as Czechoslovakia) in [[Winter Olympic Games|winter]] [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|Olympic history]].

The Czechoslovakia national football team was a consistent performer on the international scene, with eight appearances in the FIFA World Cup Finals, finishing in second place in 1934 and 1962. The team also won the European Football Championship in 1976, came in third in 1980 and won the Olympic gold in 1980. After dissolution of Czechoslovakia, the Czech national football team finished in second (1996) and thrird (2004) place at the European Football Championship.

Sport is a source of strong waves of patriotism, usually rising several days or weeks before an event. The events considered the most important by Czech fans are: the [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympic Ice hockey tournament]], [[UEFA European Football Championship]], [[UEFA Champions League]], [[FIFA World Cup]] and qualification matches for such events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prague.fm/11845/pragues-most-popular-sports/ |title=Prague's Most Popular Sports |publisher=Prague.fm |accessdate=14 May 2014}}</ref> In general, any international match of the Czech ice hockey or football national team draws attention, especially when played against a traditional rival.

The Czech Republic also has great influence in tennis, with such players as [[Ivan Lendl]], 8 times Grand Slam singles champion, [[2010 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles]] finalist [[Tomáš Berdych]], [[2011 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|2011]] and [[2014 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles]] champion [[Petra Kvitová]], [[1998 Wimbledon]] Women's Singles title [[Jana Novotná]], [[2015 French Open – Women's Singles]] finalist [[Lucie Šafářová]], [[2011 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles]] champion [[Květa Peschke]] and 18 time Grand Slam champion [[Martina Navratilova]].

One of the most popular Czech sport is [[hiking]], mainly in the Czech mountains. The word "tourist" in the Czech language also means a trekker or hiker. For beginners, thanks to the more than 100 years long tradition, there is a unique system of [[waymarking]], one of the best in Europe. There is a network of around 40,000&nbsp;km of perfectly marked{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} short and long distance trails crossing the whole country and all the Czech mountains – not only in the [[Bohemian Forest|Šumava]] Mountains, but also in the [[Bohemian-Moravian Highlands|Vysočina]], [[Ore Mountains|Krušné hory]], [[Jizera Mountains|Jizerské hory]], [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids|Beskydy]], [[Jeseníky]], [[Orlické hory]] and [[Krkonoše|Giant Mountains – Krkonoše]].
