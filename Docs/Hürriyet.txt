===Tax fine controversy===
In February 2009, the newspaper received a 826.2 million TL (US$523 million) fine for tax evasion by Doğan Group/Petrol Ofisi. Following this, the [[Istanbul Stock Exchange]] suspended Doğan Holding's shares,<ref>http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=167444</ref><ref>http://en.timeturk.com/finance-ministry-orders-bp-to-pay-tl-474-million-for-tax-evasion--16517-haberi.html</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKIST00336620090318 | publisher=[[Reuters]] | title=Turkish index suspends Dogan group, Petrol Ofisi shares | date=2009-03-18}}</ref> and Fitch downgraded Hurriyet to 'BB-'.<ref>[http://reports.fitchratings.com/coms2/summary_0266-94590_ITM] [http://www.dmg.com.tr/_UserFiles/File/News/doganyayin24AugustRAC.pdf]</ref>

Executives at the Doğan Group expressed the opinion that the tax fine was politically motivated "intimidation", caused by ''Hürriyet'''s linking of Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] and his political party, [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]], to a charity scandal in Germany. In March 2009, [[Jose Manuel Barroso]], president of the [[European Commission]], expressed public concern about the fine, saying that it threatened "pluralism and freedom of the press."<ref name="dogan hit">[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&sid=awCtRMMmOGeA Dogan Hit by $2.5 Billion Tax Fine in Erdogan Feud], Seda Sezer and Ben Holland, ''Bloomberg'', September 8, 2009</ref>

In September 2009, Doğan Group was fined a record US$2.5 billion, related to alleged past tax irregularities.<ref name="dogan hit" /><ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUSL815352620090908 Turkey gov't hits media group Dogan with tax fine], ''Reuters'', September 8, 2009</ref>

The September fine caused further expressions of public concern from the European Commission, as well as the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].<ref name="premier defends">[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125469621389762827.html Turkish Premier Defends Media Tax Battle], Marc Champion, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', October 5, 2009</ref> It also caused some critics and global investors<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aXA__UIBdOZU Feud Shaking Turkey Pits Erdogan Against Dogan Newspaper Baron], Ben Holland and Firat Kayakiran, ''Bloomberg'', June 23, 2009</ref> to compare the fines to then-[[Russia]]n President [[Vladimir Putin]]'s use of tax-evasion charges to bankrupt oil company [[Yukos]] for allegedly political reasons. In an interview, Erdoğan denied this charge, calling it "very ugly" and "disrespectful" to both himself and Putin.<ref name="premier defends" />
