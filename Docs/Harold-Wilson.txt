'''James Harold Wilson, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|KG|OBE|PC|FRS|FSS}} (11 March 1916{{spaced ndash}}24 May 1995) was a British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who served as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1976.

First entering [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]], Wilson was immediately appointed the [[Parliamentary Secretary|Parliamentary Secretary to the]] [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]] and rose quickly through the ministerial ranks, becoming the [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]] in 1947 and being appointed to the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] just months later as the [[President of the Board of Trade]]. Later, in the [[Shadow Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Labour Shadow Cabinet]], he served first as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from 1955 to 1961 and then as the [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] from 1961 to 1963, when he was elected [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] after the sudden death of [[Hugh Gaitskell]]. Wilson narrowly won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]], going on to win a much increased majority in a snap [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 election]].

Wilson's [[First Wilson ministry|first period as Prime Minister]] coincided with a period of low unemployment and relative economic prosperity, though also of significant problems with Britain's external balance of payments. In 1969 Wilson [[Operation Banner|sent British troops to Northern Ireland]]. After losing the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]] to [[Edward Heath]], he spent four years as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] before the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. After Heath's talks with the Liberals broke down, Wilson returned to power as leader of a minority government until there was a second general election in the autumn, which resulted in a narrow Labour victory. A period of economic crisis was now beginning to hit most Western countries, and in 1976 Wilson suddenly announced his resignation as Prime Minister.

Wilson's own approach to [[socialism]] was moderate, with emphasis on increasing opportunity within society, for example through change and expansion within the [[education system]], allied to the technocratic aim of taking better advantage of rapid scientific progress, rather than on the more controversial socialist goal of promoting wider [[public ownership]] of industry. He took little action to pursue the Labour Party constitution's stated dedication to such [[nationalisation]], though he did not formally disown it. Himself a member of the Labour Party's "soft left", Wilson joked about leading a Cabinet that was made up mostly of [[Social democracy|social democrats]], comparing himself to a [[Bolshevik]] revolutionary presiding over a [[Tsarist]] cabinet, but there was arguably little to divide him ideologically from the cabinet majority.<ref>The Labour government, 1974–79: political aims and economic reality by Martin Holmes</ref><ref name="labour1945">The Labour Party since 1945 by Eric Shaw</ref>

Labour Party historians see his years in office as lost opportunities for major reforms. However, in keeping with the mood of the 1960s his government sponsored liberal changes in a number of social areas; they were generally not his initiatives. These included the liberalisation of laws on censorship, divorce, homosexuality, immigration, and abortion; as well as the abolition of [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment]], which was due in part to the initiatives of backbench MPs who had the support of [[Roy Jenkins]] during his time as [[Home Secretary]]. Overall, Wilson is seen to have managed a number of difficult political issues with considerable tactical skill, including such potentially divisive issues for his party as the role of public ownership, British membership of the European Community, and the [[Vietnam War]], while continuing to maintain a costly military presence [[East of Suez]].<ref name="guardian-19950525">{{cite news|first=Geoffrey |last=Goodman |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries |title=Harold Wilson &#124; Politics |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 1 July 2005|accessdate=10 April 2014 |location=London}}</ref> His stated ambition of substantially improving Britain's long-term economic performance remained largely unfulfilled. He lost his energy and drive in his second government 1974-76 and accomplished little as the leadership split over Europe and trade union issues began tearing Labour apart.<ref>Ben Pimlott, ''Harold Wilson'' (1992) pp 604-5, 648, 656, 670-77, 689</ref>

==Early life==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2016}}
Wilson was born at 4 Warneford Road, [[Huddersfield]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], England, on 11 March 1916. He came from a political family: his father James Herbert Wilson (December 1882 – 1971) was a works chemist who had been active in the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] and then joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. His mother Ethel (''née'' Seddon; 1882–1957) was a schoolteacher before her marriage, and her brother, Sir [[Harold Seddon]], was a member of parliament in [[Western Australia]].<ref>[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/library/MPHistoricalData.nsf/(Lookup)/3A120D390FE1FC94482577E50028A7B4?OpenDocument Harold Seddon] – Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 24 May 2016.</ref> When Wilson was eight, he visited London and a later-to-be-famous photograph was taken of him standing on the doorstep of [[10 Downing Street]].

He was a supporter of his hometown football club, [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref>[http://www.football.co.uk/huddersfield_town/information.shtml Huddersfield Town FC - Information] - Football.co.uk. Retrieved 13 February 2012.</ref>

===Education===
Wilson won a scholarship to attend [[Royds Hall School|Royds Hall Grammar School]], his local [[grammar school]] (now a [[comprehensive school]]) in [[Huddersfield]] in Yorkshire. His education was disrupted in October 1930 when he contracted [[typhoid]] fever after drinking contaminated milk on a [[Scouting|Scouts]]' outing. It took him three months to recover. In December 1930, his father, working as an industrial chemist, was made redundant and it took him nearly two years to find work. He moved to [[Spital, Merseyside|Spital]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], Cheshire in order to do so. Wilson was educated in the Sixth Form at the [[Wirral Grammar School for Boys]], where he became [[Head Boy]].

Wilson did well at school and, although he missed getting a scholarship, he obtained an exhibition; which, when topped up by a county grant, enabled him to study Modern History at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], from 1934. At Oxford, Wilson was moderately active in politics as a member of the Liberal Party but was later influenced by [[G. D. H. Cole]] to join the Labour Party. After his first year, he changed his field of study to [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]]. He graduated with "an outstanding first class Bachelor of Arts degree, with alphas on every paper" in the final examinations.<ref>Ben Pimlott, ''Harold Wilson,'' London: Harper-Collins, 1993, p.59.</ref> A popular [[urban myth]] at Oxford University states that Wilson's grade in his final examination was the highest ever recorded up to that date.

Although Wilson had two abortive attempts at an [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] Fellowship, he continued in academia, becoming one of the youngest Oxford University dons of the century at the age of 21. He was a lecturer in [[Economic History]] at [[New College, Oxford|New College]] from 1937, and a Research Fellow at [[University College, Oxford|University College]].

===Marriage===
On New Year's Day 1940, in the chapel of [[Mansfield College, Oxford]], he married [[Mary Wilson, Lady Wilson of Rievaulx|Mary Baldwin]] who remained his wife until his death. Mary Wilson became a published poet. They had two sons, [[Robin Wilson (mathematician)|Robin]] and Giles (named after [[Giles Alington (academic)|Giles Alington]]); Robin became a Professor of Mathematics, and Giles became a teacher.  In their twenties, his sons were under a kidnap threat from the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] because of their father's prominence.<ref>{{cite news

===Second World War===
On the outbreak of the Second World War, Wilson volunteered for service but was classed as a specialist and moved into the civil service instead. For much of this time, he was a research assistant to [[William Beveridge]], the Master of the College, working on the issues of unemployment and the trade cycle. He later became a statistician and economist for the coal industry. He was Director of Economics and Statistics at the [[Ministry of Fuel and Power]] 1943–44, and received an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his services.<ref>{{cite book|title=Austerity Britain 1945–51|first=David |last=Kynaston|isbn=978-0-7475-9923-4|pages=236, 237|year=2008|publisher=[[Bloomsbury]]}}</ref>

He was to remain passionately interested in statistics. As [[President of the Board of Trade]], he was the driving force behind the [[Statistics of Trade Act 1947]], which is still the authority governing most economic statistics in [[UK|Great Britain]]. He was instrumental as Prime Minister in appointing [[Claus Moser]] as head of the [[Central Statistical Office, UK|Central Statistical Office]], and was president of the [[Royal Statistical Society]] in 1972–73.

==Member of Parliament (1945–64)==
As the war drew to an end, he searched for a seat to fight at the impending general election. He was selected for the constituency of [[Ormskirk (UK Parliament constituency)|Ormskirk]], then held by [[Stephen King-Hall]]. Wilson agreed to be adopted as the candidate immediately rather than delay until the election was called, and was therefore compelled to resign from his position in the Civil Service. He served as [[Praelector]] in Economics at University College between his resignation and his election to the House of Commons. He also used this time to write ''A New Deal for Coal'', which used his wartime experience to argue for nationalisation of the coal mines on the grounds of the improved efficiency he predicted would ensue.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], Wilson won his seat in the Labour landslide. To his surprise, he was immediately appointed to the government by [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] as [[Parliamentary Secretary|Parliamentary Secretary to the]] [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Works]]. Two years later, he became [[Secretary for Overseas Trade]], in which capacity he made several official trips to the [[Soviet Union]] to negotiate supply contracts.

In the general election of 1950, his Ormskirk constituency was significantly altered and he was narrowly elected for the new seat of [[Huyton (UK Parliament constituency)|Huyton]] near Liverpool, where he served for 33 years until 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HwyCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA283&lpg=PA283&dq=wilson+mp+for+ormskirk&source=bl&ots=2QEHEe0x91&sig=0P4KA5XJVaFzHA3afsukdT6aAQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RrjPVKCbIsGI7Abp2oHIDw&ved=0CEMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=wilson%20mp%20for%20ormskirk&f=false|title=The Routledge Companion to Britain in the Twentieth Century|work=google.co.uk}}</ref>

===Cabinet, 1947–51===
On 29 September 1947 Wilson was appointed [[President of the Board of Trade]], at 31 becoming the youngest member of a British Cabinet in the 20th century. He took a lead in abolishing some wartime rationing, which he referred to as a "bonfire of controls". His role in internal debates during the summer of 1949 over whether or not to devalue sterling, in which he was perceived to have played both sides of the issue, tarnished his reputation in both political and official circles.<ref name=autogenerated1>Roy Jenkins, 'Wilson, (James) Harold, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx (1916–1995)', ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[Oxford University Press]], September 2004; online edn, May 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58000, accessed 3 August 2008]</ref>

Wilson was becoming known in the Labour Party as a left-winger and joined [[Aneurin Bevan]] and [[John Freeman (British politician)|John Freeman]] in resigning from the government in April 1951 in protest at the introduction of [[National Health Service]] (NHS) medical charges to meet the financial demands imposed by the [[Korean War]]. After the Labour Party lost the [[UK general election, 1951|1951 election]], he became the Chairman of Keep Left, Bevan's political group, but soon after he began to distance himself from Bevan.

===Shadow Cabinet, 1951–64===
Wilson was appointed to the [[Shadow Cabinet (UK)|Shadow Cabinet]] by Labour Party Leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] in 1955 as [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]], and he proved to be very effective. One of his procedural moves caused a substantial delay to the progress of the Government's Finance Bill in 1955, and his speeches as Shadow Chancellor from 1956 were widely praised for their clarity and wit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1955/nov/16/finance-bill-2#column_739 |title=Hansard |date=16 November 1955 |publisher=UK Parliamentary Archives |accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He coined the term "[[Gnomes of Zurich]]" to describe Swiss bankers whom he accused of pushing the pound down by speculation. As well as his role as Shadow Chancellor, he conducted an inquiry into the Labour Party's organisation following its defeat in the [[UK general election, 1955|1955 general election]], which compared Labour's organisation to an antiquated "penny farthing"  bicycle, and made various recommendations for improvements. Unusually, Wilson combined the job of Chairman of the House of Commons' [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] with that of Shadow Chancellor from 1959, holding that position until 1963.

Wilson steered a course in intra-party matters in the 1950s and early 1960s that left him neither fully accepted nor trusted by the left and the right in the Labour Party. Despite his earlier association with the left-wing [[Aneurin Bevan]], in 1955 he backed Gaitskell, considered the right-of-centre candidate in internal Labour Party terms, against Bevan for the party leadership.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/politicsobituaries/story/0,,563492,00.html |title=Harold Wilson: Leading Labour beyond pipe dreams |first=Geoffrey |last=Goodman |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=25 May 1995 |accessdate=24 December 2007 }}</ref> He then launched an opportunistic but unsuccessful challenge to Gaitskell's leadership in November 1960 in the wake of the Labour Party's [[UK general election, 1959|1959 defeat]], Gaitskell's controversial attempt to ditch Labour's commitment to nationalisation by scrapping [[Clause Four]], and Gaitskell's defeat at the 1960 Party Conference over a motion supporting unilateral nuclear disarmament. Wilson would later be moved to the position of [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] in 1961, before he challenged for the deputy leadership in 1962 but was defeated by [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]].

Gaitskell died in January 1963, just as the Labour Party had begun to unite and appeared to have a very good chance of winning the next election, with the [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan Government]] running into trouble. Wilson was adopted as the left-wing candidate for the leadership, defeating  Brown and [[James Callaghan]] to become the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and the [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]].

At the Labour Party's 1963 Annual Conference, Wilson made both his best-remembered speech, on the implications of scientific and technological change. He argued that "the Britain that is going to be forged in the white heat of this revolution will be no place for restrictive practices or for outdated measures on either side of industry". This speech did much to set Wilson's reputation as a technocrat not tied to the prevailing class system.<ref name="'70s">{{cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|page= 9|url= }}</ref>

Labour's [[UK general election, 1964|1964 election campaign]] was aided by the [[Profumo Affair]], a ministerial sex scandal that had mortally wounded [[Harold Macmillan]] and was to taint his successor [[Alec Douglas-Home|Sir Alec Douglas-Home]], even though Home had not been involved in the scandal. Wilson made capital without getting involved in the less salubrious aspects. (Asked for a statement on the scandal, he reportedly said "No comment&nbsp;... in glorious Technicolor!"). Home was an aristocrat who had given up his title as Lord Home to sit in the House of Commons and become Prime Minister upon Macmillan's resignation. To Wilson's comment that he was the 14th [[Earl of Home]], Home retorted, "I suppose Mr. Wilson is the fourteenth Mr. Wilson".

Labour won the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]] with a narrow majority of four seats, and Wilson became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], the youngest person to hold that office since [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] 70 years earlier. During 1965, by-election losses reduced the government's majority to a single seat; but in [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|March 1966]] Wilson took the gamble of calling another general election. The gamble paid off, because this time Labour achieved a 96-seat majority<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/vote2001/in_depth/election_battles/1966_over.stm |title=VOTE2001 &#124; THE ELECTION BATTLES 1945–1997 |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> over the Conservatives, who the previous year had made Edward Heath their leader.

===Domestic affairs===

====Economic policies====
In economic terms, Wilson's first three years in office were dominated by an ultimately doomed effort to stave off the devaluation of the pound. He inherited an unusually large external deficit on the [[balance of trade]]. This partly reflected the preceding government's expansive fiscal policy in the run-up to the 1964 election, and the incoming Wilson team tightened the fiscal stance in response. Many British economists advocated devaluation, but Wilson resisted, reportedly in part out of concern that Labour, which had previously devalued sterling in 1949, would become tagged as "the party of devaluation".<ref name="A History Of The British Labour Party">{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first= Andrew|year= 2001 |title=A History Of The British Labour Party|publisher=Palgrave|isbn=978-0-333-92908-7}}</ref> In the latter half of 1967, however, an attempt was made to prevent the recession in activity from going too far in the form of a stimulus to consumer durable spending through an easing of credit, which in turn prevented a winter rise in unemployment.<ref name="inequality">{{cite book |last=Townsend |first=Peter |editor-last=Bosanquet |editor-first=Nicholas |publisher=[[Fabian Society]] |title=Labour and inequality: Sixteen Fabian Essays |isbn=978-0-7163-4004-1}}</ref>

After a costly battle, market pressures forced the government into devaluation in 1967. Wilson was much criticised for a broadcast in which he assured listeners that the "pound in your pocket" had not lost its value. It was widely forgotten that his next sentence had been "prices will rise". Economic performance did show some improvement after the devaluation, as economists had predicted. The devaluation, with accompanying austerity measures, successfully restored the balance of payments to surplus by 1969. This unexpectedly turned into a small deficit again in 1970. The bad figures were announced just before polling in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], and are often cited as one of the reasons for Labour's defeat.<ref name="A History Of The British Labour Party"/>

A main theme of Wilson's economic approach was to place enhanced emphasis on "indicative [[economic planning]]". He created a new [[Secretary of State for Economic Affairs|Department of Economic Affairs]] to generate ambitious targets that were in themselves supposed to help stimulate investment and growth (the government also created a [[Minister of Technology|Ministry of Technology]] (shortened to Mintech) to support the modernisation of industry). The DEA itself was in part intended to serve as an expansionary counter-weight to what Labour saw as the conservative influence of the Treasury, though the appointment of Wilson's deputy, George Brown, as the Minister in charge of the DEA was something of a two-edged sword, in view of Brown's reputation for erratic conduct; in any case the government's decision over its first three years to defend sterling's parity with traditional deflationary measures ran counter to hopes for an expansionist push for growth. Though now out of fashion, the faith in indicative planning as a pathway to growth,<ref>An influential study at the time, [[Andrew Shonfield]]'s ''Modern Capitalism'' (OUP, 1965), provided intellectual backing for the belief that indicative planning largely underlay the superior growth performance of France and Germany compared to the UK.</ref> embodied in the DEA and Mintech, was at the time by no means confined to the Labour Party – Wilson built on foundations that had been laid by his Conservative predecessors, in the shape, for example, of the [[National Economic Development Council]] (known as "Neddy") and its regional counterparts (the "little Neddies").<ref name="A History Of The British Labour Party" /> Government intervention in industry was greatly enhanced, with the National Economic Development Office greatly strengthened, with the number of "little Neddies" was increased, from eight in 1964 to twenty-one in 1970. The government's policy of selective economic intervention was later characterised by the establishment of a new super-ministry of technology, under [[Tony Benn]].<ref name="ReferenceN">The Labour Government 1964–70 By Brian Lapping</ref>

[[File:Nixon and Wilson.jpg|thumb|Harold and Mary Wilson with [[Richard Nixon|Richard]] and [[Pat Nixon]] at the White House in 1970.]]

The continued relevance of industrial nationalisation (a centrepiece of the post-War Labour government's programme) had been a key point of contention in Labour's internal struggles of the 1950s and early 1960s. Wilson's predecessor as leader, [[Hugh Gaitskell]], had tried in 1960 to tackle the controversy head-on, with a proposal to expunge [[Clause Four]] (the public ownership clause) from the party's constitution, but had been forced to climb down. Wilson took a characteristically more subtle approach. He threw the party's left wing a symbolic bone with the renationalisation of the steel industry, but otherwise left Clause Four formally in the constitution but in practice on the shelf.<ref name="A History Of The British Labour Party"/>

Wilson made periodic attempts to mitigate inflation through wage-price controls, better known in Britain as "prices and [[incomes policy]]"<ref name="A History Of The British Labour Party"/> (as with indicative planning, such controls—though now generally out of favour – were widely adopted at that time by governments of different ideological complexions, including the [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration in the United States). Partly as a result of this reliance, the government tended to find itself repeatedly injected into major industrial disputes, with late-night "beer and sandwiches at Number Ten" an almost routine culmination to such episodes. Among the most damaging of the numerous strikes during Wilson's periods in office was a six-week stoppage by the [[National Union of Seamen]], beginning shortly after Wilson's [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|re-election in 1966]], and conducted, he claimed, by "politically motivated men".

With public frustration over strikes mounting, Wilson's government in 1969 proposed a series of changes to the legal basis for industrial relations (labour law), which were outlined in a White Paper "[[In Place of Strife]]" put forward by the Employment Secretary [[Barbara Castle]]. Following a confrontation with the [[Trades Union Congress]], which strongly opposed the proposals, and internal dissent from [[Home Secretary]] [[James Callaghan]], the government substantially backed-down from its intentions. Some elements of these changes were subsequently to be enacted (in modified form) during the premiership of [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref name="A History Of The British Labour Party"/>

Wilson's government made a variety of changes to the tax system. Largely under the influence of the [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born economists [[Nicholas Kaldor]] and [[Thomas Balogh]], an idiosyncratic [[Selective Employment Tax]] (SET) was introduced that was designed to tax employment in the service sectors while subsidising employment in manufacturing (the rationale proposed by its economist authors derived largely from claims about potential economies of scale and technological progress, but Wilson in his memoirs stressed the tax's revenue-raising potential). The SET did not long survive the return of a Conservative government. Of longer term significance, [[Capital Gains Tax]] (CGT) was introduced across the UK on 6 April 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warr.co.uk/Changes-To-Capital-Gains-Tax.htm |title=Warr & Co Chartered Accountants – Article – Changes To Capital Gains Tax |publisher=Warr.co.uk |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref> Across his two periods in office, Wilson presided over significant increases in the overall tax burden in the UK. In 1974, three weeks after forming a new government, Wilson's new chancellor Denis Healey partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90% to 75%, increasing it to 83% in his first budget, which came into law in April 1974. This applied to incomes over £20,000 (equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20000|1974|{{Inflation-year|UK}}|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK}}, and combined with a 15% surcharge on 'un-earned' income (investments and dividends) could add to a 98% marginal rate of personal income tax. In 1974, as many as 750,000 people were liable to pay the top-rate of income tax.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifs.org.uk/bns/bn25.pdf |title=IFS: Long-Term trends in British Taxation and Spending |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> Labour's identification with high tax rates was to prove one of the issues that helped the Conservative Party under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[John Major]] dominate British politics during the 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s.

Wilson had entered power at a time when unemployment stood at around 400,000. It still stood 371,000 by early 1966 after a steady fall during 1965, but by March 1967 it stood at 631,000. It fell again towards the end of the decade, standing at 582,000 by the time of the general election in June 1970.<ref>[http://www.socialiststudies.org.uk/cinc%201930s.shtml Socialist Studies – Capitalism In Crisis – Unemployment In The 1930's] {{wayback|url=http://www.socialiststudies.org.uk/cinc%201930s.shtml |date=20121028013514 |df=y }}</ref>

====Social issues====
{{main|First Wilson ministry#Social issues}}
A number of liberalising social reforms were passed through parliament during Wilson's first period in government. These dealt with the death penalty, homosexual acts, abortion,  censorship and the voting age.  There were new restrictions on immigration. Wilson personally, coming culturally from a provincial non-conformist background, showed no particular enthusiasm for much of this agenda.<ref>''The Battle of Britain: The Home Front'', by George Goldsmith Carter.</ref>

====Education====
{{main|First Wilson ministry#Education}}
Education held special significance for a socialist of Wilson's generation, in view of its role in both opening up opportunities for children from working-class backgrounds and enabling Britain to seize the potential benefits of scientific advances. Under the first Wilson government, for the first time in British history, more money was allocated to education than to defence.<ref name="ReferenceB">The Decade of Disillusion: British Politics in the Sixties, edited by David Mckie and Chris Cook</ref> Wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities, in line with the recommendations of the [[Robbins Report]], a bipartisan policy already in train when Labour took power.

Wilson promoted the concept of an [[Open University]], to give adults who had missed out on tertiary education a second chance through part-time study and distance learning. His political commitment included assigning implementation responsibility to [[Jennie Lee, Baroness Lee of Asheridge|Baroness Lee]], the widow of [[Aneurin Bevan]].<ref name="ponting">Breach of Promise – Labour in Power, 1964–70 by Clive Ponting</ref> By 1981, 45,000 students had received degrees through the Open University.<ref name="ponting"/> Money was also channelled into local-authority run colleges of education.<ref name="ReferenceN"/>

Wilson's record on secondary education is, by contrast, highly controversial.  Pressure grew for the abolition of the selective principle underlying the "[[eleven plus]]", and replacement with [[Comprehensive school]]s which would serve the full range of children (see the article [[Debates on the grammar school]]). Comprehensive education became Labour Party policy. From 1966 to 1970, the proportion of children in comprehensive schools increased from about 10% to over 30%.<ref name="ReferenceA">Changing party policy in Britain: an introduction by Richard Kelly</ref>

Labour pressed local authorities to convert grammar schools into comprehensives. Conversion continued on a large scale during the subsequent Conservative  [[Edward Heath|Heath]] administration, although the Secretary of State, [[Margaret Thatcher]], ended the compulsion of local governments to convert.

A major controversy that arose during Wilson's first government was the decision that the government could not fulfil its long-held promise to raise the school leaving age to 16, because of the investment required in infrastructure, such as extra classrooms and teachers.

Overall, public expenditure on education rose as a proportion of GNP from 4.8% in 1964 to 5.9% in 1968, and the number of teachers in training increased by more than a third between 1964 and 1967.<ref>A Short History Of The Labour Party by Henry Pelling</ref> The percentage of students staying on at school after the age of sixteen increased similarly, and the student population increased by over 10% each year. Pupil-teacher ratios were also steadily reduced. As a result of the first Wilson government's educational policies, opportunities for working-class children were improved, while overall access to education in 1970 was broader than in 1964.<ref name="socialists1">Socialists in the Recession: The Search for Solidarity by Giles Radice and Lisanne Radice</ref> As summarised by Brian Lapping,

"The years 1964–70 were largely taken up with creating extra places in universities, polytechnics, technical colleges, colleges of education: preparing for the day when a new Act would make it the right of a student, on leaving school, to have a place in an institution of further education."<ref name="ReferenceN"/>

In 1966, Wilson was created the first [[Chancellor]] of the newly created [[University of Bradford]], a position he held until 1985.

====Housing====
{{Main|First Wilson ministry#Housing}}
Housing was a major policy area under the first Wilson government. During Wilson's time in office from 1964 to 1970, more new houses were built than in the last six years of the previous Conservative government. The proportion of council housing rose from 42% to 50% of the total,<ref name="shorthistory">A Short History of the Labour Party by Alastair J. Reid and Henry Pelling</ref> while the number of council homes built increased steadily, from 119,000 in 1964 to 133,000 in 1965 and to 142,000 in 1966. Allowing for demolitions, 1.3&nbsp;million new homes were built between 1965 and 1970,<ref name="ponting" /> To encourage home ownership, the government introduced the Option Mortgage Scheme (1968), which made low-income housebuyers eligible for subsidies (equivalent to tax relief on mortgage interest payments).<ref>Housing policy: an introduction by Paul N. Balchin and Maureen Rhoden</ref> This scheme had the effect of reducing housing costs for buyers on low incomes<ref name="autogenerated2">Capitalism and public policy in the UK by Tom Burden and Mike Campbell</ref> and enabling more people to become owner occupiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishpoliticalspeech.org/speech-archive.htm?speech=166 |title=Speech Archive |publisher=British Political Speech |date= |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>  In addition, house owners were exempted from capital gains tax. Together with the Option Mortgage Scheme, this measure stimulated the private housing market.<ref>The Evolution of the British Welfare State by Derek Fraser</ref>

Significant emphasis was also placed on town planning, with new conservation areas introduced and a new generation of new towns built, notably [[Milton Keynes]]. The New Towns Acts of 1965 and 1968 together gave the government the authority (through its ministries) to designate any area of land as a site for a [[New town|New Town]].<ref name="byrne1">Social Services: Made Simple by Tony Byrne, BA, BSc(Econ.), and Colin F. Padfield, LLB, DPA(Lond)</ref>

====Social Services and welfare====
{{Main|First Wilson ministry#Social Services and welfare}}
According to [[A.B. Atkinson]], social security received much more attention from the first Wilson government than it did during the previous thirteen years of Conservative government.<ref name="inequality" /> Following its victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]], Wilson's government began to increase social benefits. Prescription charges for medicines were abolished immediately, while pensions were raised to a record 21% of average male industrial wages. In 1966, the system of [[National Assistance]] (a social assistance scheme for the poor) was overhauled and renamed [[Supplementary Benefit]]. The means test was replaced with a statement of income, and benefit rates for pensioners (the great majority of claimants) were increased, granting them a real gain in income. Before the 1966 election, the widow's pension was tripled. Due to austerity measures following an economic crisis, [[prescription charges]] were re-introduced in 1968 as an alternative to cutting the hospital building programme, although those sections of the population who were most in need (including supplementary benefit claimants, the long-term sick, children, and pensioners) were exempted from charges.<ref name="ReferenceC">''Labour's First Century'' by Duncan Tanner, [[Pat Thane]], and Nick Tiratsoo</ref>

The widow's earning rule was also abolished,<ref name="ponting" /> while a range of new social benefits was introduced. An Act was passed which replaced National Assistance with Supplementary Benefits. The new Act laid down that people who satisfied its conditions were entitled to these noncontributory benefits. Unlike the National Assistance scheme, which operated like state charity for the worst-off, the new Supplementary Benefits scheme was a right of every citizen who found himself or herself in severe difficulties. Those persons over the retirement age with no means who were considered to be unable to live on the basic pension (which provided less than what the government deemed as necessary for subsistence) became entitled to a "long term" allowance of an extra few shillings a week. Some simplification of the procedure for claiming benefits was also introduced.<ref name="ReferenceN"/> From 1966, an exceptionally severe disablement allowance was added “for those claimants receiving constant attendance allowance which was paid to those with the higher or intermediate rates of constant attendance allowance and who were exceptionally severely disabled.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4wxjQFu2zsMC&pg=PA471&dq=From+1966,+following+a+recommendation+of+the+McCorquodale&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_cJ1VdvWF8ar7AaUtoG4AQ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=From%201966%2C%20following%20a%20recommendation%20of%20the%20McCorquodale&f=false|title=Social Security Law in Context|work=google.co.uk}}</ref> Redundancy payments were introduced in 1965 to lessen the impact of unemployment, and earnings-related benefits for maternity,<ref>{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199900/cmselect/cmsocsec/56/9112407.htm |title=House of Commons - Social Security - Minutes of Evidence |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=13 December 1999 |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> unemployment, sickness, industrial injuries and widowhood were introduced in 1966, followed by the replacement of flat-rate family allowances with an earnings-related scheme in 1968.<ref name="cook" /> From July 1966 onwards, the temporary allowance for widow of severely disabled pensioners was extended from 13 to 26 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Labour Party (Great Britain).

Increases were made in pensions and other benefits during Wilson's first year in office that were the largest ever real term increases carried out up until that point.<ref name="Timmins">The Five Giants: A Biography of the Welfare State by Nicholas Timmins</ref> Social security benefits were markedly increased during Wilson's first two years in office, as characterised by a budget passed in the final quarter of 1964 which raised the standard benefit rates for old age, sickness and invalidity by 18.5%.<ref name="Taxation">Taxation, Wage Bargaining, and Unemployment by Isabela Mares</ref> In 1965, the government increased the national assistance rate to a higher level relative to earnings, and via annual adjustments, broadly maintained the rate at between 19% and 20% of gross industrial earnings until the start of 1970.<ref name="inequality" /> In the five years from 1964 up until the last increases made by the First Wilson Government, pensions went up by 23% in real terms, supplementary benefits by 26% in real terms, and sickness and unemployment benefits by 153% in real terms (largely as a result of the introduction of earnings-related benefits in 1967).<ref name="auto1">The Labour Party in Crisis by Paul Whiteley</ref>

====Agriculture====

Under the First Wilson Government, subsidies for farmers were increased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/34 |title=Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 |publisher=Legislation.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="Crossman">Richard Crossman, The diaries of a cabinet minister, Volume 3: Secretary of State for Social Services, 1968–1970</ref> Farmers who wished to leave the land or retire became eligible for grants or annuities if their holdings were sold for approved amalgamations, and could receive those benefits whether they wished to remain in their farmhouses or not. A Small Farmers Scheme was also extended, and from 1 December 1965, 40,000 more farmers became eligible for the maximum £1,000 grant. New grants to agriculture also encouraged the voluntary pooling of smallholdings, and in cases where their land was purchased for non-commercial purposes, tenant-farmers could now receive double the previous "disturbance compensation."<ref name="Labour 1968">Labour: A Dictionary Of Achievement, Published by the Labour Party, Transport House, Smith Square, London, S.W.1.

====Health====

The proportion of GNP spent on the NHS rose from 4.2% in 1964 to about 5% in 1969. This additional expenditure provided for an energetic revival of a policy of building health centres for GPs, extra pay for doctors who served in areas particularly short of them, a significant growth in hospital staffing, and a significant increase in a hospital building programme. Far more money was spent each year on the NHS than under the 1951–64 Conservative governments, while much more effort was put into modernising and reorganising the health service.<ref name="ReferenceN"/> Stronger central and regional organisations were established for bulk purchase of hospital supplies, while some efforts were made to reduce inequalities in standards of care. In addition, the government increased the intake to medical schools.<ref name="inequality" />

The [[1966 Doctor's Charter]] introduced allowances for rent and ancillary staff, significantly increased the pay scales, and changed the structure of payments to reflect "both qualifications of doctors and the form of their practices, i.e. group practice." These changes not only led to higher morale, but also resulted in the increased use of ancillary staff and nursing attachments, a growth in the number of health centres and group practices, and a boost in the modernisation of practices in terms of equipment, appointment systems, and buildings.<ref name="byrne1"/> The charter introduced a new system of payment for GPs, with refunds for surgery, rents, ands rates, to ensure that the costs of improving his surgery did not diminish the doctor's income, together with allowances for the greater part of ancillary staff costs. In addition, a Royal Commission on medical education was set up, partly to draw up ideas for training GPS (since these doctors, the largest group of all doctors in the country, had previously not received any special training, "merely being those who, at the end of their pre-doctoral courses, did not go on for further training in any speciality).<ref name="ReferenceN"/>

In 1967, local authorities were empowered to provide [[family planning advice]] to any who requested it and to provide supplies free of charge.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> In addition, medical training was expanded following the Todd Report on medical education in 1968.<ref name="byrne1"/><ref>General practice under the National Health Service 1948–1997 by Irvine Loudon, John Horder, Charles Webster</ref> In addition, National Health expenditure rose from 4.2% of GNP in 1964 to 5% in 1969 and spending on hospital construction doubled.<ref name="shorthistory" /> The [[Health Services and Public Health Act 1968]] empowered local authorities to maintain workshops for the elderly either directly or via the agency of a voluntary body. A [[Health Advisory Service]] was later established to investigate and confront the problems of long-term psychiatric and mentally subnormal hospitals in the wave of [[Ely Hospital|numerous scandals]].<ref name="byrne1"/> The [[Family Planning Act 1967]] empowered local authorities to set up a family planning service with free advice and means-tested provision of contraceptive devices while the [[Clean Air Act 1968]] extended powers to combat air pollution.<ref name="Longman">The Longman Companion to The Labour Party 1900–1998 by Harry Harmer</ref> More money was also allocated to hospitals treating the mentally ill.<ref name="ReferenceN"/> In addition, a Sports Council was set up to improve facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_wphBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT41&dq=dennis+skinner+miners+swimming+pool+sports+council&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Tr4hVZXhFI7varWMgbgD&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=dennis%20skinner%20miners%20swimming%20pool%20sports%20council&f=false|title=Sailing Close to the Wind|work=google.co.uk}}</ref> Direct government expenditure on sports more than doubled from £0.9 million in 1964/65 to £2 million in 1967/68, while 11 regional Sports Councils had been set up by 1968. In Wales, five new health centres had been opened by 1968, whereas none had been opened from 1951 to 1964, while spending on health and welfare services in the region went up from £55.8 million in 1963/64 to £83.9 million in 1967/68.<ref name="Labour 1968"/>

====Workers====
{{main|First Wilson ministry#Workers}}
The [[Industrial Training Act 1964]] set up an Industrial Training Board to encourage training for people in work,<ref name="Longman"/> and within 7 years there were “27 ITBs covering employers with some 15 million workers.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sDbRCaCPD7wC&pg=PA251&dq=labour+government+council+for+academic+awards+1964&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qYKNVM6QLsj8UpbIg4gD&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=labour%20government%20council%20for%20academic%20awards%201964&f=false|title=Teaching and Training in Post-compulsory Education|work=google.co.uk}}</ref> From 1964 to 1968, the number of training places had doubled.<ref name="Labour 1968"/> The Docks and Harbours Act (1966) and the Dock Labour Scheme (1967) reorganised the system of employment in the docks in order to put an end to casual employment.<ref name="shorthistory"/> The changes made to the Dock Labour Scheme in 1967 ensured a complete end to casual labour on the docks, effectively giving workers the security of jobs for life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thespiritof45.com/How-We-Did-it |title=Ken Loach's film The Spirit Of '45 - How We Did it |publisher=Thespiritof45.com |date= |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> Trade unions also benefited from the passage of the [[Trade Dispute Act 1965]].

The First Wilson Government also encouraged married women to return to teaching and improved Assistance Board Concessionary conditions for those teaching part-time, “by enabling them to qualify for pension rights and by formulating a uniform scale of payment throughout the country." Soon after coming into office, midwives and nurses were given an 11% pay increase,<ref name="Labour 1968"/> and according to one MP, nurses also benefited from the largest pay rise they had received in a generation.<ref>[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1969/oct/31/pensions-and-education#S5CV0790P0_19691031_HOC_46 PENSIONS AND EDUCATION (Hansard, 31 October 1969.)] vol 790 cc509-608 - Hansard.millbanksystems.com.

Retrieved 14 January 2012</ref>

Much needed improvements were made in junior hospital doctors' salaries. From 1959 to 1970, while the earnings of manual workers increased by 75%, the salaries of registrars more than doubled while those of house officers more than trebled. Most of these improvements, such as for nurses, came in the pay settlements of 1970. On a limited scale, reports by the National Board for Prices and Incomes encouraged incentive payments schemes to be development in local government and elsewhere. In February 1969, the government accepted an "above the ceiling" increase for farmworkers, a low-paid group. Some groups of professional workers, such as nurses, teachers, and doctors, gained substantial awards.<ref name="inequality" />

====Transport====

The Travel Concessions Act of 1964, one of the first Acts passed by the First Wilson Government, provided concessions to all pensioners travelling on buses operated by municipal transport authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/10th-november-1967/98/two-pronged-fare-concessions-bid|title=Two-pronged fare-concessions bid|work=commercialmotor.com}}</ref> The [[Transport Act 1968]] established the principle of government grants for transport authorities if uneconomic passenger services were justified on social grounds. A National Freight Corporation was also established to provide integrated rail freight and road services. Public expenditure on roads steadily increased and stricter safety precautions were introduced, such as the [[breathalyser test]] for drunken driving,<ref name="ReferenceB"/> under the 1967 Road Traffic Act.<ref name="ReferenceN"/>  The Transport Act gave a much needed financial boost to [[British Rail]], treating them like they were a company which had become bankrupt but could now, under new management, carry on debt-free. The act also established a national freight corporation and introduced government [[rail subsidies]] for passenger transport on the same basis as existing subsidies for roads to enable local authorities to improve public transport in their areas.<ref name="ReferenceN"/>

The road building programme was also expanded, with capital expenditure increased to 8% of GDP, "the highest level achieved by any post-war government".<ref name="labour1">Ten Years of New Labour, edited by Matt Beech and Simon Lee</ref> Central government expenditure on roads went up from £125 million in 1963/64 to £225 million in 1967/68, while a number of road safety regulations were introduced, covering seat belts, lorry drivers’ hours, car and lorry standards, and an experimental 70 mile per hour speed limit. In Scotland, spending on trunk roads went up from £6.8 million in 1963/64 to £15.5 million in 1966/67, while in Wales, spending on Welsh roads went up from £21.2 million in 1963/64 to £31.4 million in 1966/67.<ref name="Labour 1968"/>

====Regional development====

Encouragement of regional development was given increased attention under the First Wilson Government, with the aim of narrowing economic dispratiies between the various regions. A policy was introduced in 1965 whereby any new government organisation should be established outside London and in 1967 the government decided to give preference to development areas. A few government departments were also moved out of London, with the [[Royal Mint]] moved to [[South Wales]], the Giro and Inland Revenue to [[Bootle]], and the Motor Tax Office to [[Swansea]].<ref name="beckerman">The Labour government's Economic record: 1964–1970, edited by Wilfred Beckerman</ref> A new Special Development Status was also introduced in 1967 to provide even higher levels of assistance.<ref name="ponting" /> In 1966, five development areas (covering half the population in the UK) were established, while subsidies were provided for employers recruiting new employees in the Development Areas.<ref name="A History Of The British Labour Party"/> A Highlands and Islands Development Board was also set up to “re-invigorate” the north of Scotland.<ref name="Labour 1968"/>

The [[Industrial Development Act 1966]] changed the name of Development Districts (parts of the country with higher levels of unemployment than the national average and which governments sought to encourage greater investment in) to Development Areas and increased the percentage of the workforce covered by development schemes from 15% to 20%, which mainly affected rural areas in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]]. Tax allowances were replaced by grants in order to extend coverage to include firms which were not making a profit, and in 1967 a Regional Employment Premium was introduced. Whereas the existing schemes tended to favour capital-intensive projects, this aimed for the first time at increasing employment in depressed areas. Set at £1.50 a man per week and guaranteed for seven years, the Regional Employment Premium subsidised all manufacturing industry (though not services) in Development Areas.<ref name="ponting"/>

Regional unemployment differentials were narrowed, and spending on regional infrastructure was significantly increased. Between 1965–66 and 1969–70, yearly expenditure on new construction (including power stations, roads, schools, hospitals and housing) rose by 41% in the United Kingdom as a whole. Subsidies were also provided for various industries (such as [[shipbuilding]] in [[Clydeside]]), which helped to prevent a number of job losses. It is estimated that, between 1964 and 1970, 45,000 government jobs were created outside London, 21,000 of which were located in the Development Areas.<ref name="beckerman" /> The Local Employment Act, passed in March 1970, embodied the government's proposals for assistance to 54 "intermediate" employment exchange areas not classified as full "development" areas.<ref name="Britannica1971">Britannica Book of the Year 1971, Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., William Benton (Publisher)</ref>

Funds allocated to regional assistance more than doubled, from £40&nbsp;million in 1964/65 to £82&nbsp;million in 1969/70, and from 1964 to 1970, the number of factories completed was 50% higher than from 1960 to 1964, which helped to reduce unemployment in development areas. In 1970, the unemployment rate in development areas was 1.67 times the national average, compared to 2.21 times in 1964. Although national rates of unemployment were higher in 1970 than in the early 1960s, unemployment rates in the development areas were lower and had not increased for three years.<ref name="ponting" /> Altogether, the impact of the first Wilson government's regional development policies was such that, according to one historian, the period 1963 to 1970 represented "the most prolonged, most intensive, and most successful attack ever launched on regional problems in Britain."<ref name="A History Of The British Labour Party"/>

====Urban renewal====
{{main|First Wilson ministry#Urban renewal}}
A number of subsidies were allocated to local authorities faced with acute areas of severe poverty (or other social problems).<ref name="ReferenceN"/> The [[Housing Act 1969]] provided local authorities with the duty of working out what to do about 'unsatisfactory areas'. Local authorities could declare 'general improvement areas' in which they would be able to buy up land and houses, and spend environmental improvement grants. On the same basis, taking geographical areas of need, a package was developed by the government which resembled a miniature poverty programme.<ref name="cook">The decade of disillusion: British politics in the '60s by David McKie and Chris Cook</ref> In July 1967, the government decided to pour money into what the Plowden Committee defined as Educational Priority Areas, poverty-stricken areas where children were environmentally deprived. A number of poor inner-city areas were subsequently granted EPA status (despite concerns that Local Education Authorities would be unable to finance Educational Priority Areas).<ref name="taylor" /> From 1968 to 1970, 150 new schools were built under the educational priority programme.<ref name="inequality" />

====International development====

A new Ministry of Overseas Development was established, with its greatest success at the time being the introduction of interest-free loans for the poorest countries.<ref name="ponting" /> The Minister of Overseas Development, [[Barbara Castle]], set a standard in interest relief on loans to developing nations which resulted in changes to the loan policies of many donor countries, "a significant shift in the conduct of rich white nations to poor brown ones." Loans were introduced to developing countries on terms that were more favourable to them than those given by governments of all other developed countries at that time. In addition, Castle was instrumental in setting up an Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex to devise ways of tackling global socio-economic inequalities. Overseas aid, however, bore a major brunt of the austerity measures introduced by the first Wilson government in its last few years in office, with British aid as a percentage of GNP falling from 0.53% in 1964 to 0.39% in 1969.<ref name="ReferenceN"/>

====Taxation====

Various changes were also made to the tax system which benefited workers on low and middle incomes. Married couples with low incomes benefited from the increases in the single personal allowance and marriage allowance. In 1965, the regressive allowance for national insurance contributions was abolished and the single personal allowance, marriage allowance and wife's earned income relief were increased. These allowances were further increased in the tax years 1969–70 and 1970–71. Increases in the age exemption and dependant relative's income limits benefited the low-income elderly.<ref name="inequality" /> In 1967, new tax concessions were introduced for widows.<ref name="books.google.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZvhMJWK930C&pg=PA129&dq=harold+wilson+widows+tax+concessions+1967&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-bpWVIzhJ6XV7Abzn4GgCQ&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=harold%20wilson%20widows%20tax%20concessions%201967&f=false|title=Sinners? Scroungers? Saints?|work=google.co.uk}}</ref>

Increases were made in some of the minor allowances in the 1969 Finance Act, notably the additional personal allowance, the age exemption and age relief and the dependent relative limit. Apart from the age relief, further adjustments in these concessions were implemented in 1970.<ref name="inequality" />

1968 saw the introduction of aggregation of the investment income of unmarried minors with the income of their parents. According to Michael Meacher, this change put an end to a previous inequity whereby two families, in otherwise identical circumstances, paid differing amounts of tax "simply because in one case the child possessed property transferred to it by a grandparent, while in the other case the grandparent's identical property was inherited by the parent."<ref name="inequality" />

In the 1969 budget, income tax was abolished for about 1 million of the lowest paid and reduced for a further 600,000 people,<ref name="Crossman" /> while in the government's last budget (introduced in 1970), two million small taxpayers were exempted from paying any income tax altogether.<ref>"Le contrat dans les pays anglo-saxons: théories et pratiques" by Jean-Louis Breteau</ref>

====Liberal reforms====
{{Main|First Wilson ministry#Liberal reforms}}
A wide range of liberal measures were introduced during Wilson's time in office. The [[Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970]] made provision for the welfare of children whose parents were about to divorce or be judicially separated, with courts (for instance) granted wide powers to order financial provision for children in the form of maintenance payments made by either parent.<ref name="byrne1"/> This legislation allowed courts to order provision for either spouse and recognised the contribution to the joint home made during marriage.<ref name="Longman"/> That same year, spouses were given an equal share of household assets following divorce via the Matrimonial Property Act. The [[Race Relations Act 1968]] was also extended in 1968 and in 1970 the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]] was passed.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Another important reform, the 1967 Welsh Language Act, granted 'equal validity' to the declining [[Welsh language]] and encouraged its revival. Government expenditure was also increased on both sport and the arts.<ref name="shorthistory" /> The [[Mines and Quarries (Tips) Act 1969]], passed in response to the [[Aberfan]] tragedy, made provision for preventing disused tips from endangering members of the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsUK/planning/legislation/minewaste.html |title=Legislation & policy: mineral ownership &#124; Planning &#124; MineralsUK |publisher=Bgs.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref> In 1967, corporal punishment in borstals and prisons was abolished.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oVH0fVcMx5cC&pg=PP149&dq=UK+corporal+punishment+1948&hl=en&sa=X&ei=G9ZnU6FNiY44vbSBgAI&ved=0CF8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=UK%20corporal%20punishment%201948&f=false |title=Seeking a Role: The United Kingdom 1951-1970 - Brian Harrison - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> 7 regional associations were established to develop the arts, and government expenditure on cultural activities rose from £7.7 million in 1964/64 to £15.3 million in 1968/69. A Criminal Injuries Compensation Board was also set up, which had paid out over £2 million to victims of criminal violence by 1968.<ref name="Labour 1968"/>
 
The [[Commons Registration Act 1965]] provided for the registration of all [[common land]] and [[village green]]s, whilst under the [[Countryside Act 1968]], local authorities could provide facilities "for enjoyment of such lands to which the public has access".<ref name="byrne1"/> The [[Family Provision Act 1966]] amended a series of pre-existing estate laws mainly related to persons who died interstate. The legislation increased the amount that could be paid of surviving spouses if a will hadn't been left, and also expanded upon the jurisdiction of county courts, which were given the jurisdiction of high courts under certain circumstances when handling matters of estate. The rights of adopted children were also improved with certain wording changed in the [[Inheritance (Family Provision) Act 1938]] to bestow upon them the same rights as natural-born children. In 1968, the [[Nurseries and Child-Minders Regulation Act 1948]] was updated to include more categories of childminders.<ref>Family day care: international perspectives on policy, practice and quality by Ann Mooney and June Statham</ref> A year later, the [[Family Law Reform Act 1969]] was passed, which allowed people born outside marriage to inherit on the intestacy of either parent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/private-lives/relationships/overview/legitimacyadoption/ |title=Marriage: legitimacy and adoption – UK Parliament |publisher=Parliament.uk |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> In 1967, homosexuality was decriminalised by the passage of the Sexual Offences Act.<ref name="ReferenceN"/> The First Wilson Government also introduced a thirty-year rule for access to public records, replacing a previous fifty-year rule.<ref name="SeldonHickson">New Labour, Old Labour: The Wilson and Callaghan Governments, 1974–79 edited by Anthony Seldon and Kevin Hickson</ref>

====Record on income distribution====
Despite the economic difficulties faced by the first Wilson government, it succeeded in maintaining low levels of unemployment and inflation during its time in office. Unemployment was kept below 2.7%, and inflation for much of the 1960s remained below 4%. Living standards generally improved, while public spending on housing, social security, transport, research, education and health went up by an average of more than 6% between 1964 and 1970.<ref name="white heat">White Heat: A History of Britain in the Swinging Sixties, Dominic Sandbrook</ref> The average household grew steadily richer, with the number of cars in the United Kingdom rising from one to every 6.4 persons to one for every five persons in 1968, representing a net increase of three million cars on the road. The rise in the standard of living was also characterised by increased ownership of various consumer durables from 1964 to 1969, as demonstrated by television sets (from 88% to 90%), refrigerators (from 39% to 59%), and washing machines (from 54% to 64%).<ref name="ReferenceN"/>

By 1970, income in Britain was more equally distributed than in 1964, mainly because of increases in cash benefits, including family allowances.<ref>The Struggle for Labour's Soul: Understanding Labour's political thought since 1945 by Raymond Plant, Matt Beech and Kevin Hickson</ref>

According to one historian,

{{quote|''"In its commitment to social services and public welfare, the Wilson government put together a record unmatched by any subsequent administration, and the mid-sixties are justifiably seen as the 'golden age' of the welfare state"''.<ref name="white heat" />}}

As noted by [[Ben Pimlott]], the gap between those on lowest incomes and the rest of the population "had been significantly reduced" under Wilson's first government.<ref>Harold Wilson by Ben Pimlott</ref> The first Wilson government thus saw the distribution of income became more equal,<ref name="socialists1"/> while reductions in poverty took place.<ref>Poverty in Britain, 1900–1965 by Ian Gazeley</ref> These achievements were mainly brought about by several increases in social welfare benefits,<ref>Understanding Social Policy by Michael James Hill</ref> such as supplementary benefit, pensions and family allowances, the latter of which were doubled between 1964 and 1970 (although most of the increase in family allowances did not come about until 1968). A new system of rate rebates was introduced, which benefited one million households by the end of the 1960s.<ref name="ponting" /> Increases in national insurance benefits in 1965, 1967, 1968 and 1969 ensured that those dependant on state benefits saw their [[disposable and discretionary income|disposable incomes]] rise faster than manual wage earners, while income differentials between lower income and higher income workers were marginally narrowed. Greater progressivity was introduced in the tax system, with greater emphasis on direct (income-based) as opposed to indirect (typically expenditure-based) taxation as a means of raising revenue, with the amount raised by the former increasing twice as much as that of the latter.<ref name="whiting">The Labour Party and Taxation: Party Identity and Political Purpose in Twentieth-Century Britain by Richard Whiting</ref> Also, in spite of an increase in unemployment, the poor improved their share of the national income while that of the rich was slightly reduced.<ref name="labour1945"/> Despite various cutbacks after 1966, expenditure on services such as education and health was still much higher as a proportion of national wealth than in 1964. In addition, by raising taxes to pay their reforms, the government paid careful attention to the principle of redistribution, with disposable incomes rising for the lowest paid while falling amongst the wealthiest during its time in office.<ref>The Labour Party Since 1945 by Kevin Jeffreys</ref>

Between 1964 and 1968, benefits in kind were significantly progressive, in that over the period those in the lower half of the income scale benefited more than those in the upper half. On average those receiving state benefits benefited more in terms of increases in real disposable income than the average manual worker or salaried employee between 1964 and 1969.<ref name="beckerman" /> From 1964 to 1969, low-wage earners did substantially better than other sections of the population. In 1969, a married couple with two children were 11.5% per cent richer in real terms, while for a couple with three children, the corresponding increase was 14.5%, and for a family with four children, 16.5%.<ref name="hansard.millbanksystems.com">[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1970/may/27/clause-14 Clause 14, ALTERATIONS OF PERSONAL RELIEFS (Hansard, 27 May 1970)] -Hansard.millbanksystems.com. Retrieved 13 February 2012.</ref> From 1965 to 1968, the income of single pensioner households as a percentage of other one adult households rose from 48.9% to 52.5%. For two pensioner households, the equivalent increase was from 46.8% to 48.2%.<ref name="inequality" /> In addition, mainly as a result of big increases in cash benefits, unemployed persons and large families gained more in terms of real disposable income than the rest of the population during Wilson's time in office.<ref name="socialists1"/>

As noted by Paul Whiteley, pensions, sickness, unemployment, and supplementary benefits went up more in real terms under the First Wilson Government than under the preceding Conservative administration:

“To compare the Conservative period of office with the Labour period, we can use the changes in benefits per year as a rough estimate of comparative performance. For the Conservatives and Labour respectively increases in supplementary benefits per year were 3.5 and 5.2 percentage points, for sickness and unemployment benefits 5.8 and 30.6 percentage points, for pensions 3.8 and 4.6, and for family allowances -1.2 and -2.6. Thus the poor, the retired, the sick and the unemployed did better in real terms under Labour than they did under Conservatives, and families did worse.”<ref name="auto1"/>

Between 1964 and 1968, cash benefits rose as a percentage of income for all households but more so for poorer than for wealthier households. As noted by the economist Michael Stewart,

"it seems indisputable that the high priority the Labour Government gave to expenditure on education and the health service had a favourable effect on income distribution."<ref name="beckerman" />

For a family with two children in the income range £676 to £816 per annum, cash benefits rose from 4% of income in 1964 to 22% in 1968, compared with a change from 1% to 2% for a similar family in the income range £2,122 to £2,566 over the same period. For benefits in kind the changes over the same period for similar families were from 21% to 29% for lower income families and from 9% to 10% for higher income families. When taking into account all benefits, taxes and Government expenditures on social services, the first Wilson government succeeded in bringing about a reduction in income inequality. As noted by the historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]],

"In the long term, therefore, fortified by increases in supplementary and other benefits under the Crossman regime in 1968–70, the welfare state had made some impact, almost by inadvertence, on social inequality and the maldistribution of real income".<ref>Labour in Power, 1945–1951 by Kenneth O. Morgan</ref>

Public expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose significantly under the 1964–1970 Labour government, from 34% in 1964–65 to nearly 38% of GDP by 1969–70, whilst expenditure on social services rose from 16% of national income in 1964 to 23% by 1970.<ref name="ponting" /> These measures had a major impact on the living standards of low-income Britons, with disposable incomes rising faster for low-income groups than for high-income groups during the course of the 1960s. When measuring disposable income after taxation but including benefits, the total disposable income of those on the highest incomes fell by 33%, whilst the total disposable income of those on the lowest incomes rose by 104%.<ref name="ponting" /> As noted by one historian,

"the net effect of Labour's financial policies was indeed to make the rich poorer and the poor richer".<ref>To Build A New Jerusalem: The British Labour Movement from the 1880s to the 1990s by A.J. Davies</ref>

===External affairs===

====Europe====
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F019859-0022, Staatsbesuch Harold Wilson, Ludwig Erhard.jpg|right|thumb|Wilson with West German Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]].]]
Among the more challenging political dilemmas Wilson faced was the issue of British membership of the [[European Community]], the forerunner of the present European Union. An entry attempt was vetoed in 1963 by French President [[Charles de Gaulle]]. The Labour Party in Opposition had been divided on the issue, with former party leader [[Hugh Gaitskell]] having come out in 1962 in opposition to Britain joining the Community.<ref>Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: "Hugh Gaitskell".</ref>

After initially hesitating over the issue, Wilson's Government in May 1967 lodged the UK's second application to join the European Community. It was vetoed by de Gaulle in November 1967.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Gowland|title=Britain and European Integration Since 1945: On the Sidelines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvt-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA69|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|page=69|display-authors=etal}}</ref> After De Gaulle lost power, Conservative prime minister Edward Heath negotiated Britain's admission to the EC in 1973.

Wilson in opposition showed political ingenuity in devising a position that both sides of the party could agree on, opposing the terms negotiated by Heath but not membership in principle. Labour's 1974 manifesto included a pledge to renegotiate terms for Britain's membership and then [[Referendum Act, 1975|hold a referendum]] on whether to stay in the EC on the new terms. This was a constitutional procedure without precedent in British history.

Following Wilson's return to power, the renegotiations with Britain's fellow EC members were carried out by Wilson himself in tandem with Foreign Secretary [[James Callaghan]], and they toured the capital cities of Europe meeting their European counterparts.  The discussions focused primarily on Britain's net [[Public finance|budgetary]] contribution to the EC. As a small agricultural producer heavily dependent on imports, Britain suffered doubly from the dominance of:

:(i) agricultural spending in the EC [[Government budget|budget]],
:(ii) agricultural [[Tariff|import taxes]] as a source of EC [[revenue]]s.

During the renegotiations, other EEC members conceded, as a partial offset, the establishment of a significant [[European Regional Development Fund]] (ERDF), from which it was clearly agreed that Britain would be a major net beneficiary.<ref>Andrew Moravcsik, "The Choice for Europe" (Cornell, 1998)</ref>

In the subsequent referendum campaign, rather than the normal British tradition of "collective responsibility", under which the government takes a policy position which all cabinet members are required to support publicly, members of the Government were free to present their views on either side of the question. The electorate [[United Kingdom referendum, 1975|voted on 5 June 1975]] to continue membership, by a substantial majority.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/6/newsid_2499000/2499297.stm 1975: UK embraces Europe in referendum] BBC On This Day</ref>

====Asia====
American military involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] escalated continuously from 1964 to 1968 and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] brought pressure to bear for at least a token involvement of British military units. Wilson consistently avoided any commitment of British forces, giving as reasons British military commitments to the [[Malayan Emergency]] and British co-chairmanship of the [[1954 Geneva Conference]].<ref>Rhiannon Vickers, "Harold Wilson, the British Labour Party, and the War in Vietnam." ''Journal of Cold War Studies'' 10#2 (2008): 41-70. [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/jcws.2008.10.2.41 online]</ref>

His government offered some rhetorical support for the US position (most prominently in the defence offered by the Foreign Secretary [[Michael Stewart, Baron Stewart of Fulham|Michael Stewart]] in a much-publicised "[[teach-in]]" or debate on Vietnam). On at least one occasion the British government made an unsuccessful effort to mediate in the conflict, with Wilson discussing peace proposals with [[Alexei Kosygin]], the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|USSR Council of Ministers]]. On 28 June 1966 Wilson 'dissociated' his Government from American bombing of the cities of Hanoi and Haiphong. In his memoirs, Wilson writes of "selling LBJ a [[A bum steer|bum steer]]", a reference to Johnson's Texas roots, which conjured up images of cattle and cowboys in British minds.<ref name="Government1"/> [[File:NAAImageM4297 Holt Wilson.jpg|thumb|left|Harold and Mary Wilson greeting the [[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Harold Holt]] and wife [[Zara Holt|Zara]] in 1967.]]

Part of the price paid by Wilson after talks with President Johnson in June 1967 for US assistance with the UK economy was his agreement to maintain a military presence [[East of Suez]].<ref>''The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army'' (1994) p. 359</ref> In July 1967 [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] [[Denis Healey]] announced that Britain would abandon her mainland bases East of Suez by 1977, although airmobile forces would be retained which could if necessary be deployed in the region. Shortly afterward, in January 1968, Wilson announced that the proposed timetable for this withdrawal was to be accelerated, and that British forces were to be withdrawn from Singapore, Malaysia, and the Persian Gulf by the end of 1971.<ref>{{Cite book | last = French | first = David | title = The British Way in Warfare, 1688–2000 | publisher=Routledge | year = 1990 | page = 220 | url = | id = | isbn = 978-0-04-445789-3}}</ref>

Wilson was known for his strong pro-[[Israel]] views. He was a particular friend of Israeli Premier [[Golda Meir]], though her tenure largely coincided with Wilson's 1970–1974 hiatus. Another associate was West German [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] [[Willy Brandt]]; all three were members of the [[Socialist International]].<ref>[http://www.jamd.com/search?assettype=g&assetid=2634403&text=wilson+meir+brandt ] {{wayback|url=http://www.jamd.com/search?assettype=g&assetid=2634403&text=wilson+meir+brandt |date=20150713180501 |df=y }}</ref>

====Africa====
The British "retreat from Empire" had made headway by 1964 and was to continue during Wilson's administration. The [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] came to present serious problems.  Southern Rhodesia, which had been the economic powerhouse of the Federation, was not granted independence, principally because Wilson refused to grant independence to the white minority government headed by Rhodesian Prime Minister [[Ian Smith]] which not willing to extend unqualified voting rights to the native African population.  Smith's defiant response was a [[Unilateral Declaration of Independence (Rhodesia)|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]], on 11 November 1965.  Wilson's immediate recourse was to the United Nations, and in 1965, the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] imposed sanctions, which were to last until official independence in 1979. This involved [[Beira Patrol|British warships blockading the port of Beira]] to try to cause economic collapse in Rhodesia. Wilson was applauded by most nations for taking a firm stand on the issue (and none extended diplomatic recognition to the Smith régime). A number of nations did not join in with sanctions, undermining their efficiency. Certain sections of public opinion started to question their efficacy, and to demand the toppling of the régime by force. Wilson declined to intervene in Rhodesia with military force, believing the British population would not support such action against their "kith and kin". The two leaders met for discussions aboard British warships, {{HMS|Tiger|C20|2}} in 1966 and {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} in 1968. Smith subsequently attacked Wilson in his memoirs, accusing him of delaying tactics during negotiations and alleging duplicity; Wilson responded in kind, questioning Smith's good faith and suggesting that Smith had moved the goal-posts whenever a settlement appeared in sight.<ref name="Government1">Harold Wilson, "The Labour Government, 1964–70: a Personal Record"</ref> The matter was still unresolved at the time of Wilson's resignation in 1976.

==Defeat and return to opposition (1970–74)==
By 1969, the Labour Party was suffering serious electoral reverses, and by the turn of 1970 had lost a total of 16 seats in by-elections since the previous general election.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/background/pastelec/ge70.shtml |title=BBC Politics 97 |publisher=BBC  |date=18 June 1970 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref>

By 1970, the economy was showing signs of improvement, and by May that year, Labour had overtaken the Conservatives in the opinion polls.<ref>Twentieth-century Britain: a political history by W. D. Rubinstein, P.298</ref> Wilson responded to this apparent recovery in his government's popularity by calling a general election, but, to the surprise of most observers, was defeated at the polls by the Conservatives under Heath.

Wilson survived as leader of the Labour party in opposition. In the summer of 1973, holidaying on the [[Isles of Scilly]], he tried to board a motor boat from a dinghy and stepped into the sea. He was unable to get into the boat and was left in the cold water, hanging on to the fenders of the motor boat. He was close to death before he was saved by passers by. The incident was taken up by the press and resulted in some embarrassment for Wilson; his press secretary, [[Joe Haines (journalist)|Joe Haines]], tried to deflect some of the comment by blaming Wilson's dog for the problem.

Economic conditions during the 1970s were becoming more difficult for Britain and many other western economies as a result of the ending of the [[Bretton Woods Agreement]] and the [[1973 oil shock]], and the Heath government in its turn was buffeted by economic adversity and industrial unrest (notably including confrontation with the coalminers which led to the [[Three-day week]]) towards the end of 1973, and on 7 February 1974 (with the crisis still ongoing) Heath called a snap election for 28 February.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/low/dates/stories/february/7/newsid_4054000/4054793.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 7 &#124; 1974: Heath calls snap election over miners |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=26 September 2011 |date=7 February 1974}}</ref>

==Second term as Prime Minister (1974–76)==
{{see also|Labour Government 1974–79}}
Labour won more seats (though fewer votes) than the Conservative Party in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|General Election]] in February 1974, which resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. As Heath was unable to persuade the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] to form a [[coalition]], Wilson returned to [[10 Downing Street]] on 4 March 1974 as Prime Minister of a minority Labour Government. He gained a three-seat majority in [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|another election later that year]], on 10 October 1974. One of the key issues addressed during his second period in office was the referendum on British membership of the EEC (see ''[[Harold Wilson#Europe|Europe]]'', above).

===Domestic affairs===
The Second Wilson Government made a major commitment to the expansion of the British welfare state, with increased spending on education, health, and housing rents.<ref name="labour1"/>  To pay for it, it imposed controls and raised taxes on the rich. It partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top rate of tax from 90% to 75%, increasing it to 83% in the first budget from new chancellor Denis Healey, which came into law in April 1974. Also implemented was an investment income surcharge which raised the top rate on investment income to 98%, the highest level since the Second World War.

Despite its achievements in social policy, however, Wilson's government came under scrutiny in 1975 for the rise in the unemployment rate, with the total number of Britons out of work passing 1,000,000 by April of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressandstar.com/days/1950-75/1975.html |title=Those were the days |publisher=Expressandstar.com |date= |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref>

===Northern Ireland===
Wilson's earlier government had witnessed the outbreak of [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland. In response to a request from the [[Executive Committee of the Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Government of Northern Ireland]], Wilson agreed to [[Operation Banner|deploy the British Army]] in August 1969 in an effort to restore the peace.

Out of office in the autumn of 1971, Wilson formulated a 16-point, 15-year programme that was designed to pave the way for the unification of Ireland. The proposal was not adopted by the then Heath government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/72may/donoghue.htm |title=May 1972 &#124; Ireland: The View from Dublin |last=Donoghue|first= Denis |work=The Atlantic |date=31 October 2001 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |quote=Edward Heath thanked him without adopting his suggestions.}}</ref>

In May 1974, when back in office as leader of a minority government, Wilson condemned the [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionist]]-controlled [[Ulster Workers Council Strike]] as a "[[sectarianism|sectarian]] strike", which was "being done for sectarian purposes having no relation to this century but only to the seventeenth century". However he refused to pressure a reluctant [[British Army]] to face down the [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitaries who were intimidating utility workers. In a televised speech later, he referred to the loyalist strikers and their supporters as "spongers" who expected Britain to pay for their lifestyles. The strike was eventually successful in breaking the power-sharing [[Northern Ireland]] executive.

On 11 September 2008, BBC Radio Four's ''Document'' programme claimed to have unearthed a secret plan – codenamed ''Doomsday'' – which proposed to cut all of the United Kingdom's constitutional ties with Northern Ireland and transform the province into an independent dominion. ''Document'' went on to claim that the Doomsday plan was devised mainly by Wilson and was kept a closely guarded secret. The plan then allegedly lost momentum, due in part, it was claimed, to warnings made by both the then Foreign Secretary, James Callaghan, and the then Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Garret FitzGerald]] who admitted the 12,000-strong Irish army would be unable to deal with the ensuing civil war.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7610750.stm|title=Wilson had NI 'doomsday' plan|work=BBC News}}</ref>

In 1975 Wilson secretly offered Libya's dictator [[Muammar Gaddafi]] £14 million (£500 million in 2009 values) to stop arming the IRA, but Gaddafi demanded a far greater sum of money.<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/britain-offered-gaddafi-16314m-to-stop-supporting-the-ira-1797754.html "Britain offered Gaddafi £14m to stop supporting the IRA"] - ''The Independent'' (London).

===Resignation===
On 16 March 1976, Wilson announced his resignation as Prime Minister (taking effect on 5 April 1976). He claimed that he had always planned on resigning at the age of 60, and that he was physically and mentally exhausted. As early as the late 1960s, he had been telling intimates, like his doctor Sir Joseph Stone (later [[Lord Stone of Hendon]]), that he did not intend to serve more than eight or nine years as Prime Minister. Roy Jenkins has suggested that Wilson may have been motivated partly by the distaste for politics felt by his loyal and long-suffering wife, Mary.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> His doctor had detected problems which would later be diagnosed as [[colon cancer]], and Wilson had begun drinking brandy during the day to cope with stress.<ref name="guardian-19950525" /> In addition, by 1976 he might already have been aware of the first stages of early-onset [[Alzheimer's disease]], which was to cause both his formerly excellent memory and his powers of concentration to fail dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alzheimers-research.org.uk/news/article.php?type=News&id=316 |title=Latest news – The leading UK research charity for dementia |publisher=Alzheimers-research.org.uk |date=10 November 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>

[[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] came to dine at 10 Downing Street to mark his resignation, an honour she has bestowed on only one other Prime Minister, Sir [[Winston Churchill]].

Wilson's [[1976 Prime Minister's Resignation Honours|Prime Minister's Resignation Honours]] included many businessmen and celebrities, along with his political supporters. His choice of appointments caused lasting damage to his reputation, worsened by the suggestion that the first draft of the list had been written by his political secretary [[Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia Williams]] on lavender notepaper (it became known as the "Lavender List"). [[Roy Jenkins]] noted that Wilson's retirement "was disfigured by his, at best, eccentric resignation honours list, which gave peerages or knighthoods to some adventurous business gentlemen, several of whom were close neither to him nor to the Labour Party."<ref>Roy Jenkins, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/58000 'Wilson, (James) Harold, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx (1916–1995)'], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, May 2006, Retrieved 22 February 2008</ref> Some of those whom Wilson honoured included [[Joseph Kagan, Baron Kagan|Lord Kagan]], the inventor of Gannex, who was eventually imprisoned for fraud, and Sir [[Eric Miller (businessman)|Eric Miller]], who later committed suicide while under police investigation for corruption.

Six candidates stood in the first ballot to replace him, in order of votes they were: [[Michael Foot]], [[James Callaghan]], [[Roy Jenkins]], [[Tony Benn]], [[Denis Healey]] and [[Anthony Crosland]]. In the third ballot on 5 April, Callaghan defeated Foot in a parliamentary vote of 176 to 137, thus becoming Wilson's successor as Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party, and he continued to serve as Prime Minister until May 1979, when Labour lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election]] to the Conservatives and [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Britain's first female prime minister.

As Wilson wished to remain an MP after leaving office, he was not immediately given the [[peerage]] customarily offered to retired Prime Ministers, but instead was created a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]]. On leaving the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]] he was created '''Baron Wilson of Rievaulx''', after [[Rievaulx Abbey]], in the north of his native Yorkshire.

==Retirement and death (1983–95)==

Shortly after resigning as Prime Minister, Wilson was signed by [[David Frost]] to host a series of interview/chat show programmes. The pilot episode proved to be a flop as Wilson appeared uncomfortable with the informality of the format. Wilson also hosted two editions of the BBC chat show ''[[Friday Night, Saturday Morning]]''. He famously floundered in the role, and in 2000, Channel 4 chose one of his appearances as one of the 100 Moments of TV Hell. Wilson also coined the name of charity [[War on Want]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waronwant.org/about-us/our-history |title=War on Want's history |publisher=Waronwant.org |date=9 June 1952 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>

A lifelong [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] fan, in 1975, Wilson joined the Board of Trustees of the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte Trust]] at the invitation of Sir [[Hugh Wontner]], who was then the [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref>Wilson and Lloyd, p. 7</ref> At Christmas 1978, Wilson appeared on the ''[[Morecambe and Wise]]'' Christmas Special. [[Eric Morecambe]]'s habit of appearing not to recognise the guest stars was repaid by Wilson, who referred to him throughout as 'Morry-camby' (the mis-pronunciation of Morecambe's name made by [[Ed Sullivan]] when the pair appeared on his famous American television show). Wilson appeared on the show again in 1980.

Wilson was not especially active in the House of Lords, although he did initiate a debate on unemployment in May 1984.<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1984/may/09/unemployment Hansard]'' HL 5ser vol 451 cols 923–1002.</ref> His last speech was in a debate on marine pilotage in 1986, when he commented as an elder brother of [[Trinity House]].<ref>''[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1986/jun/25/marine-pilotage#S5LV0477P0_19860625_HOL_197 Hansard]'' HL 5ser vol 477 cols 389-90.</ref> In the same year, he played himself as Prime Minister in an [[Anglia Television]] drama, "Inside Story".<ref>{{IMDb title|0094486|Inside Story}}; see [http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//ITN/1986/02/12/AS120286004 ITNsource] for video.</ref>

He continued regularly attending the House of Lords until just over a year before his death; the last sitting he attended was on 27 April 1994.<ref>''LJ'' [1994] 342.</ref> Wilson died from [[Colorectal cancer|colon cancer]] and Alzheimer's disease in May 1995, aged 79. His death came mere months before the death of his predecessor, [[Alec Douglas-Home]]. His memorial service was held in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 13 July 1995. It was attended by [[Prince Charles]], former Prime Ministers [[Edward Heath]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], then Prime Minister [[John Major]] and future Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]. Wilson was buried at [[St. Mary's Old Church, St. Mary's]] on the [[Isles of Scilly]] on 6 June. His epitaph is ''{{Lang|la|Tempus Imperator Rerum}}'' (''Time the Commander of All Things'').

==Political style==
Wilson regarded himself as a "man of the people" and did much to promote this image, contrasting himself with the stereotypical aristocratic conservatives who had preceded him. Features of this portrayal included his working man's [[Gannex]] raincoat, his pipe (the British Pipesmokers' Council voted him [[Pipe Smoker of the Year]] in 1965 and Pipeman of the Decade in 1976, though in private he smoked cigars), his love of simple cooking and fondness for popular British relish [[HP Sauce]], and his support for his home town's football team, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].<ref>[http://english.ohmynews.com/articleview/article_view.asp?menu=c10400&no=340222&rel_no=1 "A 2012 Chance for David Beckham?"], OhMy News International Sports, 16 January 2007</ref> His speech showed a [[Yorkshire dialect and accent|Yorkshire accent]] at times. Eschewing continental holidays, he returned every summer with his family to the [[Isles of Scilly]]. His first general election victory relied heavily on associating these down-to-earth attributes with a sense that the UK urgently needed to modernise, after "thirteen years of Tory mis-rule&nbsp;...". These characteristics were exaggerated in ''[[Private Eye (magazine)|Private Eye's]]'' satirical column "[[Prime Minister parodies (Private Eye)|Mrs Wilson's Diary]]".

Wilson exhibited his populist touch in June 1965 when he had [[the Beatles]] honoured with the award of [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (such awards are officially bestowed by The Queen but are nominated by the Prime Minister of the day). The award was popular with young people and contributed to a sense that the Prime Minister was "in touch" with the younger generation. There were some protests by conservatives and elderly members of the military who were earlier recipients of the award, but such protesters were in the minority. Critics claimed that Wilson acted to solicit votes for the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|next general election]] (which took place less than a year later), but defenders noted that, since the minimum voting age at that time was 21, this was hardly likely to impact many of the Beatles' fans who at that time were predominantly teenagers. It cemented Wilson's image as a modernistic leader and linked him to the burgeoning pride in the 'New Britain' typified by the Beatles. The Beatles mentioned Wilson rather negatively, naming both him and his opponent Edward Heath in [[George Harrison]]'s song "[[Taxman]]", the opener to 1966's ''[[Revolver (The Beatles album)|Revolver]]''—recorded and released after the MBEs.

In 1967, Wilson had a different interaction with a musical ensemble. He sued the pop group [[the Move]] for libel after the band's manager [[Tony Secunda]] published a promotional postcard for the single "[[Flowers in the Rain]]", featuring a caricature depicting Wilson in bed with his female assistant, [[Marcia Williams]]. Gossip had hinted at an improper relationship, though these rumours were never substantiated. Wilson won the case, and all royalties from the song (composed by Move leader [[Roy Wood]]) were assigned in perpetuity to a charity of Wilson's choosing.

Wilson coined the term '[[Selsdon Man]]' to refer to the anti-interventionist policies of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[Edward Heath]], developed at a policy retreat held at the [[Selsdon]] Park Hotel in early 1970. This phrase, intended to evoke the 'primitive throwback' qualities of anthropological discoveries such as [[Piltdown Man]] and [[Homo erectus|Swanscombe Man]], was part of a British political tradition of referring to political trends by suffixing 'man'. Other memorable phrases attributed to Wilson include "the white heat of the [technological] revolution", and "a week is a long time in politics", meaning that political fortunes can change extremely rapidly. In his broadcast after the 1967 devaluation of the pound, Wilson said: "This does not mean that the pound here in Britain – in your pocket or purse – is worth any less&nbsp;...", and the phrase "the pound in your pocket" subsequently took on a life of its own.

===Reputation===
Despite his successes and one-time popularity, Harold Wilson's reputation took a long time to recover from the low ebb reached immediately following his second premiership. Some accuse him of undue deviousness, some claim he did not do enough to modernise the Labour Party's policy positions on issues such as the respective roles of the state and the market or the reform of industrial relations. This line of argument partly blames Wilson for the civil unrest of the late 1970s (during Britain's [[Winter of Discontent]]), and for the electoral success of the Conservative party and its ensuing 18-year rule. His supporters argue that Wilson's skilful management (on issues such as nationalisation, Europe and Vietnam) allowed an otherwise fractious party to stay politically united and govern. This co-existence did not long survive his leadership, and the factionalism that followed contributed greatly to the Labour Party's electoral weakness during the 1980s. The reinvention of the Labour Party would take the better part of two decades, at the hands of [[Neil Kinnock]], [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] and – electorally, most conclusively – [[Tony Blair]].

In 1964, when Wilson took office, the mainstream of informed opinion (in all the main political parties, in academia and the media, etc.) strongly favoured the type of technocratic, "[[indicative planning]]" approach that Wilson endeavoured to implement. Radical market-orientated reforms, of the kind eventually adopted by [[Margaret Thatcher]], were in the mid-1960s backed only by a 'fringe' of enthusiasts (such as the leadership of the later-influential [[Institute of Economic Affairs]]), and had almost no representation at senior levels even of the Conservative Party. Fifteen years later, disillusionment with Britain's weak economic performance and troubled industrial relations, combined with active spadework by figures such as Sir [[Keith Joseph]], had helped to make a radical market programme politically feasible for Thatcher (which was in turn to influence the subsequent Labour leadership, especially under Blair).

An opinion poll in September 2011 found that Wilson came in third place when respondents were asked to name the best post-war Labour Party leader. He was beaten only by John Smith and Tony Blair.<ref>[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/4099 More from YouGov/Sunday Times], UKPollingReport blog.

==Possible plots and conspiracy theories==
{{Main|Harold Wilson conspiracy theories}}

===MI5 plots===
In 1963, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[defector]] [[Anatoliy Golitsyn]] is said to have secretly claimed that Wilson was a [[KGB]] agent.<ref name="Mitrokhin">[[Vasili Mitrokhin]], [[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]] (2000). The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West. Gardners Books. ISBN 978-0-14-028487-4</ref>  The majority of intelligence officers did not believe that Golitsyn was credible in this and various other claims, but a significant number did (most prominently [[James Jesus Angleton]], Deputy Director of Operations for [[Counter-intelligence|Counter-Intelligence]] at the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]]) and factional strife broke out between the two groups. Former [[MI5]] officer [[Peter Wright]] claimed in his memoirs, ''[[Spycatcher]]'', that 30 MI5 agents then collaborated in an attempt to undermine Wilson.<ref>{{cite book |title=Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer |last=Wright |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Wright |first2=Paul |last2=Greengrass |year=1987 |accessdate=1 July 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Spycatcher.html?id=7ZBmHMr-LtUC}}</ref>

In March 1987, James Miller, a former agent, claimed that the [[Ulster Workers Council Strike]] of 1974 had been promoted by MI5 in order to help destabilise Wilson's government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch87.htm |title=Chronology of the Conflict 1987 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> In July 1987, Labour MP [[Ken Livingstone]] used his [[maiden speech]] to raise the 1975 allegations of a former Army Press officer in Northern Ireland, [[Colin Wallace]], who also alleged a plot to destabilise Wilson. [[Chris Mullin (politician)|Chris Mullin]], MP, speaking on 23 November 1988, argued that sources other than Peter Wright supported claims of a long-standing attempt by MI5 to undermine Wilson's government.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&STEMMER=en&WORDS=peter%20wright&ALL=&ANY=&PHRASE=%22Peter%20Wright%20%22&CATEGORIES=&SIMPLE=&SPEAKER=&COLOUR=red&STYLE=s&ANCHOR=Debate-9_spnew6&URL=/pa/cm198889/cmhansrd/1988-11-23/Debate-9.html#Debate-9_spnew6 House of Commons Handard Debates for 23 November 1988] Retrieved 1 July 2012</ref>

In 2009, '' The Defence of the Realm'', the authorised history of MI5 by [[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]], held that while MI5 kept a file on Wilson from 1945, when he became an MP – because communist civil servants claimed that he had similar political sympathies – there was no bugging of his home or office, and no conspiracy against him.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8288247.stm MI5 kept file on former PM Wilson], BBC News, 3 October 2009</ref> In 2010 newspaper reports made detailed allegations that the bugging of [[10 Downing Street]] had been omitted from the history for "wider public interest reasons". In 1963 on Macmillan's orders following the Profumo Affair, MI5 bugged the cabinet room, the waiting room, and the prime minister's study until the devices were removed in 1977 on Callaghan's orders. From the records it is unclear if Wilson or Heath knew of the bugging, and no recorded conversations were retained by MI5 so possibly the bugs were never activated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7101127.ece|title=Allegations No.10 was bugged by MI5 'removed' from official history|first=Brendan|last= Bourne|date=18 April 2010|work=The Sunday Times |location=London |accessdate=20 April 2010 }}</ref> Professor Andrew had previously recorded in the preface of the history that "One significant excision as a result of these requirements (in the chapter on The Wilson Plot) is, I believe, hard to justify" giving credence to these new allegations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1266837/Revealed-How-MI5-bugged-10-Downing-Street-Cabinet-Prime-Ministers-15-YEARS.html|title=Revealed: How MI5 bugged 10 Downing Street, the Cabinet and at least five Prime Ministers for 15 YEARS|first=Jason |last=Lewis |first2=Tom |last2=Harper|date=18 April 2010|work=Daily Mail |location=UK|accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>

===Other conspiracy theories===
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
[[Richard Hough]], in his 1980 biography of Mountbatten, indicates that [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Mountbatten]] was approached during the 1960s in connection with a scheme to install an "emergency government" in place of Wilson's administration. The approach was made by [[Cecil Harmsworth King]], the chairman of the [[IPC Media|International Publishing Corporation]] (IPC), which published the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper. Hough bases his account on conversations with the ''Mirror'''s long-time editor [[Hugh Cudlipp]], supplemented by the recollections of the scientist [[Solly Zuckerman]] and of Mountbatten's valet, William Evans. Cudlipp arranged for Mountbatten to meet King on 8 May 1968. King had long yearned to play a more central political role, and had personal grudges against Wilson (including Wilson's refusal to propose King for the hereditary earldom that King coveted). He had already failed in an earlier attempt to replace Wilson with [[James Callaghan]]. With Britain's continuing economic difficulties and industrial strife in the 1960s, King convinced himself that Wilson's government was heading towards collapse. He thought that Mountbatten, as a member of the Royal Family and a former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], would command public support as leader of a non-democratic "emergency" government. Mountbatten insisted that his friend, Zuckerman, be present (Zuckerman says that he was urged to attend by Mountbatten's son-in-law, [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]], who worried King would lead Mountbatten astray). King asked Mountbatten if he would be willing to head an emergency government. Zuckerman said the idea was treason and Mountbatten in turn rebuffed King. He does not appear to have reported the approach to [[Downing Street]].

The question of how serious a threat to democracy may have existed during these years continues to be contentious—a key point at issue being who of any consequence would have been ready to move beyond grumbling about the government (or spreading rumours) to actively taking unconstitutional action. Cecil King himself was an inveterate schemer but an inept actor on the political stage. Perhaps significantly, when King penned a strongly worded editorial against Wilson for the ''Daily Mirror'' two days after his abortive meeting with Mountbatten, the unanimous reaction of IPC's directors was to fire him with immediate effect from his position as Chairman. King's resignation was considered a serious enough matter for the BBC to have senior journalist William Hardcastle announce it in a news flash. More fundamentally, [[Denis Healey]], who served for six years as Wilson's [[Secretary of State for Defence]], has argued that actively serving senior British military officers would not have been prepared to overthrow a constitutionally elected government.

By the time of his resignation, Wilson's own perceptions of any threat may very well have been exacerbated by the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]]; his inherent tendency to chariness was undoubtedly stoked by some in his inner circle, including [[Marcia Falkender, Baroness Falkender|Marcia Williams]]. He reportedly shared with a surprised [[George H. W. Bush]], at the time the Director of the CIA, his fear that some of the portraits in 10 Downing Street (specifically including Gladstone's portrait in the Cabinet Room) concealed listening devices being used to bug his discussions.<ref>See, e.g., Financial Times obituary of Lord Hunt, the cabinet secretary at the time: 2/3 August 2008.</ref>  Files released on 1 June 2005 show that Wilson was concerned that, while on the [[Isles of Scilly]], he was being monitored by Russian ships disguised as [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]]. [[MI5]] found no evidence of this, but told him not to use a [[walkie-talkie]].

Wilson's Government took strong action against the [[Church of Scientology]] in 1967, banning foreign Scientologists from entering the country, a prohibition which remained in force until 1980. In response, [[L. Ron Hubbard]], Scientology's founder, accused Wilson of being in cahoots with [[Soviet Russia]] and an international conspiracy of [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]] and financiers. Wilson's Minister of Health, [[Kenneth Robinson]], subsequently won a libel suit against the Scientologists and Hubbard.

===Statues and other tributes===
[[File:Harold Wilson statue.jpg|thumb|Statue in St George's Square, [[Huddersfield]].]]

A portrait of Harold Wilson, painted by the famous Scottish portrait artist [[Cowan Dobson]], hangs today at University College, Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/the-right-honourable-sir-harold-wilson-19161995-lord-wils223862|title=BBC - Your Paintings - The Right Honourable Sir Harold Wilson (1916–1995), Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, Fellow, Prime Minister (1964–1970 & 1974–1976)|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Two statues of Harold Wilson stand in prominent places. The first, unveiled by the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in July 1999, stands outside [[Huddersfield railway station]] in St George's Square, Huddersfield. Costing £70,000, the statue, designed by sculptor Ian Walters, is based on photographs taken in 1964 and depicts Wilson in walking pose at the start of his first term as Prime Minister. His widow, Mary requested that the eight-foot tall monument did not show Wilson holding his famous pipe as she feared it would make the representation a caricature.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/390348.stm|title=UK PoliticsPipeless Wilson immortalised in bronze |publisher=BBC |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>

In September 2006, [[Tony Blair]] unveiled a second bronze statue of Wilson in the latter's former constituency of [[Huyton]], near [[Liverpool]]. The statue was created by Liverpool sculptor, Tom Murphy, and Blair paid tribute to Wilson's legacy at the unveiling, including the [[Open University]]. He added: "He also brought in a whole new culture, a whole new country. He made the country very, very different".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23367944-blairs-tribute-to-harold-wilson.do |title=Blair's tribute to Harold Wilson |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>

Also in 2006, a street on a new housing development in [[Tividale]], West Midlands, was named Wilson Drive in honour of Wilson. Along with neighbouring new development Callaghan drive (named after [[James Callaghan]]), it formed part of a large housing estate developed since the 1960s where all streets were named after former prime ministers or senior parliamentary figures.

==Bibliography==
{{Main|Harold Wilson bibliography}}
There is an extensive bibliography on Harold Wilson. He is the author of a number of books. He is the subject of many biographies (both light and serious) and academic analyses of his career and various aspects of the policies pursued by the governments he led. He features in many "humorous" books. He was the Prime Minister in the so-called "[[Swinging London]]" era of the 1960s, and therefore features in many of the books about this period of history.
