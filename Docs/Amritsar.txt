'''Amritsar''' ({{audio|Amritsar.ogg|pronunciation}}; {{lang-pa|ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤਸਰ}}; {{IPA-pa|əmːɾɪt̪səɾ}}), historically also known as ''Rāmdāspur'' and colloquially as ''Ambarsar'', is a city in north-western part in [[India]] and the administrative headquarters of the [[Amritsar district]] in the state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]].

According to the 2011 census, the population of Amritsar was 1,132,761. The city is situated {{convert|217|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northwest of state capital [[Chandigarh]]. It is near [[Pakistan]], with the [[Wagah Border]] being only {{convert|28|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} away. The nearest city is [[Lahore]], the second largest city in Pakistan, located {{convert|50|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} to the west.
 
[[Hinduism]] is the largest religion in Amritsar city, practised by 49.4% of the total population. It is closely followed by [[Sikhism]], which is practised by approximately 48% of the city's total population.<ref>http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-01/DDW03C-01%20MDDS.XLS</ref>

Amritsar is home to the [[Harmandir Sahib]] (commonly known as the Golden Temple), the spiritual and cultural center for the [[Sikh]] religion. This important Sikh shrine attracts more visitors than the [[Taj Mahal]] with more than 100,000 visitors on weekdays alone and is the most popular destination for [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|non-resident Indians]] (NRI) in the whole of India. The city also houses the [[Akal Takht]], the highest seat of earthly authority of the [[Khalsa]], and the [[Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee|committee]] responsible for the upkeep of [[Gurdwaras]].

The Ramtirth temple situated at Amritsar is believed to be [[Ashram]] site of Maharishi Valmiki, the writer of [[Ramayana]]. According to the [[Hindu mythology]], Goddess [[Sita]] gave birth to Luv and Kush, sons of lord [[Rama]] at Ramtirth ashram. Large number of people visit Ramtirth temple at annual fair. Nearby cities to Amritsar, [[Lahore]] and [[Kasoor]] were said to be founded by Lava and Kush, respectively. During [[Ashvamedha]] [[Yagna]] by Lord [[Rama]], Lava and Kush captured the ritual horse and tied lord [[Hanuman]] to a tree near to today's [[Durgiana Temple]]. During Navratra festivities it is considered to be auspicious by [[Hindu]] population of the city to visit that temple.<ref>[https://saanjh.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/mamas-turn-sons-into-monkeys-langoor-wala-mela-in-amritsar/]</ref>

The main commercial activities of Amritsar include tourism, carpets and fabrics, farm produce, handicrafts, service trades, and light engineering. The city is known for its rich cuisine, and culture, and for the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] in 1919 under British Rule. Amritsar is home to Central Khalsa Orphanage, which was once home to [[Udham Singh]], a prominent figure in the [[Indian independence movement]]. Gandhi Ground is the main sports complex in the city which is home to the Amritsar Games Association, (AGA).

Amritsar has been chosen as one of the heritage cities for [[HRIDAY - Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana]] scheme of Government of India.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://hridayindia.in/|website=HRIDAY official website}}</ref>

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
Amritsar is one of the largest cities of the [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] state in India. The city origin lies in the village of Tung, and was named after the lake founded by the fourth [[Sikh Guru]] [[Ram Das]] in 1574 on land bought by him for 700 rupees from the owners of the village of Tung.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amritsar.com/Golden%20Temple%20History.shtml |title=History, Harmandir Sahib, the Golden Temple, Amritsar |publisher=Amritsar Portal |accessdate=29 November 2014}}</ref> Earlier, Guru Ram Das had begun building Santokhsar Sarovar, near the village of Sultanwind in 1564 (according to one source in 1570). It could not be completed before 1588. In 1574, Guru Ram Das built his residence and moved to this place. At that time, it was known as Guru Da Chakk. (Later, it came to be known as Chakk Ram Das.)

Amritsar's central walled city has narrow streets mostly developed in the 17th and 18th century. The city is a peculiar example of an introverted planning system with unique areas called Katras. The Katras are self-styled residential units that provided unique defence system during attacks on the city.

===Jallianwala Bagh massacre===
{{main|Jallianwala Bagh massacre}}
[[File:Jallianwallah.jpg|thumb|The Jallianwalla Bagh in 1919, months after the massacre]]
[[File:BulletMarks.JPG|thumb|Bullet marks on the walls of the park premises]]
The Jallianwala Bagh massacre, involving the killing of hundreds of Indian civilians on the orders of a senior British military officer, [[Reginald Dyer|Reginald Edward Harry Dyer]], took place on 13 April 1919 in the heart of Amritsar, the holiest city of the Sikhs, on a day sacred to them as the birth anniversary of the [[Khalsa]] (Vaisakhi day).

In the Punjab, during World War I (1914–18), there was considerable unrest particularly among the Sikhs, first on account of the demolition of a boundary wall of Gurdwara Rakab Ganj at New Delhi and later because of the activities and trials of the [[Ghadarite]]s, almost all of whom were Sikhs. In India as a whole, too, there had been a spurt in political activity mainly owing to the emergence of two leaders: [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948) who after a period of struggle against the British in South Africa, had returned to India in January 1915, and [[Annie Besant]] (1847–1933), head of the Theosophical Society of India, who on 11 April 1916 established the [[Indian Home Rule Movement|Home Rule League]] with autonomy for India as its goal. In December 1916, the Indian National Congress, at its annual session held at Lucknow, passed a resolution asking the king to issue a proclamation announcing that it is the "aim and intention of British policy to confer self-government on India at an early date".<ref>''Proceedings of the Lucknow Session of the Indian National Congress, 1916,'' cited by {{cite book|last=Pasricha|first=Ashu|title=The Political Thought of Annie Besant (Encyclopaedia of Eminent Thinkers, Vol. 25)|accessdate=13 October 2013|year=2008|publisher=Concept Publishing|isbn=8180695859|page=84''}}</ref>

On 10 April 1919, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, two popular proponents of the Satyagraha movement led by Gandhi, were called to the deputy commissioner's residence, arrested and sent off by car to Dharamsetla, a hill town, now in Himachal Pradesh. This led to a general strike in Amritsar. Excited groups of citizens soon merged into a crowd of about 50,000 marching on to protest to the deputy commissioner against the arrest of the two leaders. The crowd, however, was stopped and fired upon near the railway foot-bridge. According to the official version, the number of those killed was 12 and of those wounded between 20 and 30. Evidence before an inquiry of the Indian National Congress put the number of the dead between 20 and 30.

Three days later, on 13 April, the traditional festival of Baisakhi, thousands of Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh. An hour after the meeting began as scheduled at 16:30, Dyer arrived with a group of sixty-five Gurkha and twenty-five Baluchi soldiers. Without warning the crowd to disperse, Dyer blocked the main exits and ordered his troops to begin shooting toward the densest sections of the crowd. Firing continued for approximately ten minutes. A British inquiry into the massacre placed the death toll at 379. The Indian National Congress determined that approximately 1,000 people were killed.

===Partition of 1947===
{{main|Partition of India}}
Partition of [[British India]] into [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] had a most profound effect on the demographics, economics, culture, political and social structures of Amritsar. The state of Punjab was divided between India and Pakistan and Amritsar became a border city, often on the front lines of [[India-Pakistan wars]]. Prior to partition, the Muslim league wanted to incorporate Amritsar into Pakistan because of the Amritsar's proximity to [[Lahore]] (a distance of 30 miles) and a nearly 50% Muslim population,{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} but the city became part of India. The [[Indian National Congress]] had similar aims of incorporating Lahore into India as Lahore was the cultural, economic, and political capital of undivided Punjab and Hindus and Sikhs constituted nearly 50% of the population, but Lahore became a part of Pakistan. Amritsar and Lahore experienced some of the worst communal riots during the partition of India. Muslim residents of Amritsar left the city en-masse leaving their homes and property behind because of violent anti-Muslim riots in Amritsar. Similar scenes of communal carnage against Hindus and Sikhs were witnessed in Lahore and led to their mass evacuation. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Important Muslim dominated villages in Amritsar district prior to partition include Sultanpur, Kala Afgana, Abdul Kalan, Rasheed Bal, Lahorie, Shahpur, Shahkot, Alipur, Aliwal, Allahbad, Fatehbad, Chak, Guza Chak, Jattan, Cheema.

==Transport==
The city lies on the main [[Grand Trunk Road]] (GT Road) from Delhi to Amritsar connecting to [[Lahore]] in Pakistan. The G. T. Road, built by [[Sher Shah Suri]], runs through the whole of the northern half of the Indian subcontinent, connecting [[Peshawar]], Pakistan to [[Sonargaon]], Bangladesh. The city is also connected to most other major cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta by an extensive network of rail system. The city also provides air connectivity to major Indian cities, as well as foreign cities such as Birmingham, Toronto, Dubai, Singapore, Tashkent, Ashgabat, London etc. from Guru Ramdas International Airport (formerly the Raja Sansi International Airport). The airport is being developed for increasing demand in future; a new{{when|date=April 2015}} International inbound and outbound terminal is operational, and a cargo terminal is under construction. The city is the administrative center for the Amritsar District. However, it did not become the industrial center of Punjab because of its proximity to the volatile Indo-Pakistan border.

===Air===
[[File:Amritsar Airport Entrance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport]] in Amritsar]]Amritsar's international airport, [[Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport]], has more than 250 domestic and international flights during the week with daily connections to [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]], and [[Srinagar]] etc. in India and international flights to [[London]]([[Heathrow]]), [[Birmingham]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]] via [[Delhi]]. Also it has direct flights to [[Doha]], [[Ashgabat]], [[Kuala lumpur]], [[Singapore]],  [[Tashkent]] and [[Dubai]].

[[Allama Iqbal International Airport]] is about {{convert|30|km|mi}} west of Amritsar, in [[Lahore]], Pakistan.

===Rail===
Amritsar is well connected by rail to almost all major cities in India. [[Amritsar railway station]] is the main terminal station. There is a special train ([[Samjhauta Express]]) that runs west to [[Wagah railway station|Wagah]] (Attari Border), which is the last station on the border in India before continuing on to Pakistan.

[[Indian Railways]] has proposed a high-speed rail line to serve Delhi-Amritsar via [[Ambala]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The train is to run at high speeds of 160&nbsp;km/h, second only in India to the [[Bhopal Shatabdi Express]]. It will travel the 445&nbsp;km between the two cities in 2.5 hours (compared to the current time of 5 hours). Companies from Japan, China, UK and Canada have expressed an interest in the project. The contract for building the line were to be awarded at the end of May 2008. Other lines of this kind have proposed in [[Mumbai]], [[Ahmedabad]], [[Pune]], and [[Kolkata]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Fancy_reaching_Chandigarh_from_Delhi_in_50_mins_flat/articleshow/2925479.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Rail ride to Chandigarh from Delhi in 50 mins flat? | date=4 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/News_By_Industry/Railways_invites_global_bids_for_Delhi-Amritsar_high_speed_route/articleshow/2890633.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Railways invites global bids for Delhi-Amritsar high speed route | date=23 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News_by_Industry/Speed_machines_13_states_want_Bullet_Train/articleshow/2929820.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Speed machines: 13 states want Bullet Train | date=6 April 2008}}</ref>

===Road===
[[File:ISBT Amritsar.jpg|thumb|right|Amritsar Inter State Bus Stand]]
Amritsar is located on the historic [[Grand Trunk Road]] (G.T Road), also known as [[National Highway 1 (India)|National Highway 1]], and therefore very well connected to the road network. Daily bus services run to and from [[Ambala]], [[Patiala]], [[Delhi]], Chandigarh and [[Jammu (city)|Jammu]]. Rs 450,000,000 is being spent to expand the Amritsar-[[Jalandhar]] stretch of G.T. Road to four lanes. In 2010, elevated road with four lanes connected to the National highway for better access to the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] has been started.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060401/punjab1.htm |title=The Tribune, Chandigarh, India – Punjab |publisher=Tribuneindia.com |date= |accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref>
