'''AFC Bournemouth''' is a [[professional]] [[association football|football]] club based in [[Bournemouth]], [[Dorset]], that plays in the [[Premier League]], the top tier of the [[English football league system]], Formed in 1890 as '''Boscombe St. John's Institute F.C.''', the club was reformed in 1899 as '''Boscombe F.C.'''. They changed to  '''Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic F.C.''' in 1923, before settling on their current name in 1972. Nicknamed ''The Cherries'', since 1910 Bournemouth have played their home games at [[Dean Court]]. Their home colours are red and black striped shirts, with black shorts and socks.

AFC Bournemouth have won the [[List of teams promoted from the English Football League Championship and predecessors|second]] and [[List of winners of English Football League One and predecessors|third]] tiers of English football, and were twice champions of the [[List of winners of English Football League Two and predecessors|fourth tier]]. They have also won the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], the [[Football League Trophy]], and the [[Football League Third Division South Cup]].

Currently managed by [[Eddie Howe]], the 2015–16 season is AFC Bournemouth's first ever season in England's top division.

==History==

===Boscombe F.C.===
Although the exact date of the club's foundation is not known, there is proof that it was formed in the autumn of 1899 out of the remains of the older Boscombe St. John's Lads' Institute F.C.<ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |title=AFC Bournemouth History |url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/club/club-history/ |work=AFC Bournemouth |date=12 May 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2015 | location=Bournemouth |publisher= AFC Bournemouth |postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref> The club was originally known as '''Boscombe F.C.'''. The first president was Mr. J. C. Nutt.<ref>The official Handbook of Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic Football Club; ''Golden Jubilee 1899–1949''</ref>

In their first season, 1899–1900, Boscombe F.C. competed in the Bournemouth and District Junior League. They also played in the Hants Junior Cup. During the first two seasons, they played on a football pitch in Castlemain Avenue, Pokesdown. From their third season, the team played on a pitch in [[King's Park, Boscombe|King's Park]]. In the 1905–06 season, Boscombe F.C. graduated to senior amateur football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/club/club-history/| date=24 May 2012 |title=AFCB Club History }}</ref>

In 1910, the club was granted a long lease upon some wasteland next to Kings Park as the clubs football ground by President J. E. Cooper-Dean. With their own ground, named Dean Court after the benefactor, the club continued to thrive and dominated the local football scene. Also in 1910, the club signed their first professional football player B. Penton.

Around about this time, the club obtained their nickname "The Cherries," with two foremost tales on how the club gained the nickname. First, because of the cherry-red striped shirts that the team played in and, perhaps less plausible, because Dean Court was built adjacent to the Cooper-Dean estate, which, it is erroneously assumed, encompassed numerous cherry orchards.

For the first time, during the 1913–14 season, the club competed in the [[FA Cup]]. The club's progress, however, was halted in 1914 with the outbreak of [[World War I]], and Boscombe F.C. returned to the [[Hampshire League]].

In 1920, the Third Division was formed and Boscombe were promoted to the Southern League, finding moderate success.

[[File:Deancourt 14092013 vblackpool.jpg|400px|thumbnail|right|[[Dean Court]] ]]

===Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic Football Club===
To make the club more representative of the district, the name was changed to '''Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic Football Club''' in 1923. During the same year, the club was elected to the Football League. The first league match was in [[Swindon]] on 25 August 1923, which Bournemouth lost 3–1. The first league game at Dean Court was also against Swindon, where Bournemouth gained their first league point after a 0–0 draw.

Initially, Bournemouth struggled in the Football League but eventually established themselves as a Third Division club. Bournemouth and Boscombe Athletic Football Club remain on the records as the longest continuous members of the Third Division.

As a league club, Bournemouth had to wait until after the Second World War before winning their first trophy. This was accomplished as they beat [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in the Third Division (South) Cup in the final at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]].

===AFC Bournemouth===
Under manager [[John Bond (footballer)|John Bond]], the club adopted the more streamlined '''AFC Bournemouth''' name in 1972. At the same time, the club adopted a new badge as a symbol of the club's progress. The stripes in the background were based on the club shirt, while in the foreground is the profile of a player heading the ball, in honour of [[Dickie Dowsett]], a prolific scorer for the club in the 1950s and 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cherries launch evolved crest |url=http://www.afcb.co.uk/news/article/2013-07-15-cherries-launch-evolved-crest-912766.aspx |publisher=AFC Bournemouth |accessdate=10 August 2015}}</ref>

Their red and black kit, introduced in 1971, was based on the [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] strip.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} This was the era of [[Ted MacDougall]], a prolific goalscorer who, in an FA Cup tie in November 1971, scored nine goals in an 11–0 win against [[Margate F.C.|Margate]].

===Late 20th century===
[[File:AFC Bournemouth League Performance.svg|thumb|right|300px|Chart of yearly table positions of Bournemouth in the League.]]The club recorded a famous victory over holders [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[FA Cup]] in January 1984, while they were managed by [[Harry Redknapp]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Struthers |first=Greg |title=Caught in Time: Bournemouth beat Manchester United, FA Cup, 1984 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/article786175.ece |work=[[The Times]] |date=8 January 2006 |accessdate=17 February 2008 | location=London |publisher=The Times |postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last= |first= |title=8 January 1984: Bournemouth 2 Man Utd 0 |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,626795,00.html |work=[[The Observer]] |date=6 January 2002 |accessdate=17 February 2008 | location=London |publisher= The Observer |postscript= <!--None-->}}</ref>

Redknapp took Bournemouth into the second tier of the English league for the first time in their history as Third Division champions in 1987. After comfortably surviving in their first season in Division Two, Bournemouth made a serious challenge for promotion to the top-flight in the [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89 season]]; they ultimately fell away after a poor run late in the season, but their eventual finish of 12th place remained their highest-ever Football League until the [[2013–14 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2013–14 season]].

On 5 May 1990, the final day of the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90 season]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] had the chance to win the Second Division and gain promotion into the First Division by beating Bournemouth at Dean Court. Some United fans had already caused trouble in the town during the morning and the atmosphere was tense as Leeds won the match by a single goal. Combined with the results of other matches, this meant that Leeds were promoted while Bournemouth were relegated. The violence and destruction by visitors to Bournemouth continued over the holiday weekend, causing more than £1 million worth of damage and injury to opposing fans and police officers.<ref name="archive.bournemouthecho.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://archive.bournemouthecho.co.uk/2004/5/5/67408.html |title=Bournemouth, Poole, Christchurch news, sports and jobs.

Financially, the Leeds trouble affected the club for more than a decade, as Bournemouth were prevented by local police from staging home games on Bank Holidays (traditionally a popular day for football) until a game against [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] on 21 April 2003.

Redknapp remained at the club for two more seasons, both of which ended with the club falling three points short of the play-offs. However, mounting financial pressures caused him to resign his position at the end of the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92 season]], and he subsequently rejoined former club [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] as a coach. He was replaced by [[Tony Pulis]], who built a much cheaper squad that could only manage two consecutive 17th-place finishes before Pulis walked out of the club, blaming financial pressures much as his predecessor had done.

Bournemouth went the first few months of the [[1994–95 in English football|1994–95 season]] without a permanent manager in place, and a dreadful start saw them bottom of the table for much of the first half of the season. Despite a minor upturn in form when [[Mel Machin]] was appointed as manager, they looked highly unlikely to survive, given that there were five relegation spots in Division Two for that season due to league reconstruction. However, a late run of form combined with collapses by relegation rivals [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] and [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] saw them survive on the last day of the season by just two points.

Machin ultimately remained in charge for six years, most of which were marked by unremarkable mid-table finishes. The [[1998–99 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|1998–99 season]] proved to be arguably the highlight of his tenure, with the club making a serious play-off challenge for most of the season, but ultimately falling short and finishing seventh. However, a drop to 16th place in the [[1999–2000 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|1999–2000 season]] followed by a bad start to the following season saw Machin removed from his position and given the role of director of football.

===Early 21st century===
[[Image:AFC Bournemouth.svg|200px|thumb|right|Former AFC Bournemouth crest]]
[[Sean O'Driscoll]] was promoted from the coaching staff in place of Mel Machin at the start of the [[2000–01 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2000–01 season]]. In O'Driscoll's first season as manager, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the Division Two playoffs, but were relegated a year later in the new stadium. The board kept faith in O'Driscoll and they were rewarded with promotion via the Division Three playoffs in [[2002–03 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2002–03]]. The club became the first to score five goals at the [[Millennium Stadium]] when they beat [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] 2–5 in the [[2002–03 in English football|2002–03]] Division Three play-off final with goals from [[Steve Fletcher]], [[Carl Fletcher (Welsh footballer)|Carl Fletcher]] (2), [[Stephen Purches]] and [[Garreth O'Connor]]. Under O'Driscoll, Bournemouth narrowly missed out on the play-offs for the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] and [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] seasons, and just avoided relegation in the [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] season.

Long-serving player [[James Hayter (footballer)|James Hayter]] scored the fastest league hat-trick in English Football League history during the [[2003–04 in English football|2003–04]] season. The Cherries were leading 3–0 against [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]] thanks to goals from Stephen Purches, [[Warren Cummings]] and [[Warren Feeney]] when Hayter was brought onto the field as a substitute. With 86 minutes gone, Hayter managed to net three goals in the space of two minutes and 17 seconds, making the final score 6–0 to Bournemouth.

In September 2006, with the team in eighth in the League, Sean O'Driscoll left to become manager of [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]. He was replaced by [[Kevin Bond (footballer)|Kevin Bond]].

In February 2008, Bournemouth were forced into administration, suffering a ten-point deduction which put them in relegation trouble. Bournemouth had debts of around £4 million and almost went out of business completely.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bournemouth/7233678.stm |title=Cherries go into administration |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=17 May 2010}}</ref> The off-field uncertainty continued throughout the season, with only one, ultimately unsuccessful, bid for the club accepted,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afcb.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10324~1280796,00.html |title=3 April Press conference transcript |publisher=Afcb.premiumtv.co.uk |date= |accessdate=17 May 2010}}</ref> and the club ended the season being relegated to [[League Two]].

Ahead of the [[2008–09 in English football|2008–09 season]], the team's future in the Football League was put into doubt when the league threatened to block Bournemouth's participation in League Two, due to problems with the team's continuing administration and change in ownership. It ordered both Bournemouth and [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] to demonstrate that they could fulfil all of their fixtures and find a way out of administration,<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/aug/06/rotherham.bournemouth Troubled League Two clubs on the brink] ''The Guardian'', 6 August 2008</ref> eventually allowing the club to compete with a 17-point penalty for failing to follow the Football League insolvency rules. The new company was also ordered to pay unsecured creditors the amount offered at the time of the original [[Trading while insolvent#Company voluntary agreement|C.V.A.]] (around ten pence in the pound) within two years.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/aug/07/bournemouth.leaguetwofootball Bournemouth hit by 17 point penalty] ''The Guardian'', 7 August 2008</ref>

Early into the season, manager Bond was sacked and was replaced by former player [[Jimmy Quinn (Northern Irish footballer)|Jimmy Quinn]], who would himself leave the club only a few months later.<ref>[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/4013110.QUINN_AND_CHERRIES_PART_COMPANY QUINN AND CHERRIES PART COMPANY] ''Bournemouth Daily Echo'', 31 December 2008</ref>
Former player [[Eddie Howe]] took over as manager with the club still ten points adrift at the bottom of the league and initially on a caretaker basis, becoming the youngest manager in the Football League at the age of 31.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11750_4817560,00.html |title=Howe handed permanent role |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2009 |publisher=Sky Sports}}</ref>

At the end of 2008, it was announced that local businessman Adam Murry completed the purchase of 50% of the club's shares from previous chairman Paul Baker. However, in January 2009, Murry missed the deadline to buy Baker's shares.<ref>[http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/4013023.UPDATED__CLUB_CONFIRMS_BAKER_BUY_OUT CLUB CONFIRMS BAKER BUY-OUT] ''Bournemouth Daily Echo'', 31 December 2008</ref>

In the final home game of the 2008–09 season, the Cherries guaranteed their Football League status by beating [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]] 2–1 with a winning goal ten minutes from time by Bournemouth legend Steve Fletcher, sparking wild celebrations after a fairytale ending to "The Great Escape." They finished their troubled season with their best away win in 30 years with a 0–4 victory at [[Morecambe F.C.|Morecambe]].

In June 2009, a consortium including Adam Murry finally took over AFC Bournemouth. The consortium included Jeff Mostyn, former vice-chairman Steve Sly, Neill Blake and former [[Dorchester Town]] chairman Eddie Mitchell.

Howe's first full season in charge brought success as Bournemouth finished second in League Two to earn promotion with two games to spare. Howe subsequently left the club for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] during the following season; his successor, another former Bournemouth player, [[Lee Bradbury]], led Bournemouth to the League One play-offs. The two-legged semi-final against [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] finished 3–3 after extra time, and Huddersfield went through the final by winning the penalty shoot-out 4–2. Bradbury was unable to lead Bournemouth to another promotion challenge in the [[2011–12 Football League One]], placing 11th after a season of indifferent results, and was replaced by youth team coach [[Paul Groves (footballer)|Paul Groves]] for the final games of the season.

Groves remained in charge at the start of the [[2012–13 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2012–13 season]], only to be sacked in October 2012 following a start which left the club near the bottom of the table. Eddie Howe returned as manager, and not only did he pull the club away from their early-season relegation battle, they achieved promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], returning to the second-tier of English football for the first time since 1990. The club also revealed a new club crest.<ref>[http://www.football-shirts.co.uk/fans/afc-bournemouth-launch-new-crest_21507.AFC Bournemouth Launch New Crest] ''Football-shirts.co.uk'', 15 July 2013</ref>
After a promising start to life in the Championship, the club was handed a fourth Round [[FA Cup]] tie with [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] which ended in a 2–0 loss. Bournemouth finished their first season back in the Championship in tenth place, their highest ever position in the Football League.

On 25 October 2014, Bournemouth won 0–8 away at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St. Andrew's]] against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]]. It was the first time that the Cherries had ever scored eight goals in a league game, barring a 10–0 win over [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] in September 1939 which was expunged from the records after World War II broke out the next day, and they recorded their biggest winning margin in a league fixture.<ref name="bbc 2014-10-25">{{cite web | last = BBC | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2014 | url = http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29669693 | title= Managerless Birmingham City suffered a humiliating defeat as Bournemouth scored eight goals at St Andrew's. | format = | work = | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 25 October 2014}}</ref> The club followed up this success with a 2–1 victory over [[Premier League]] side [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in the League Cup, reaching the quarter-finals of the competition for the first time. Bournemouth were again drawn against Liverpool but lost 3–1. The club spent most of the [[2014–15 A.F.C. Bournemouth season|2014–15 season]] near the top of the table, and a 0–3 win away at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] on the final day of the season was enough to clinch the Championship title and a first ever promotion to the top flight of English football.<ref>{{cite web|title=GALLERY: All the incredible pictures as Cherries are crowned champions of Football League|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/12928783.GALLERY__All_the_incredible_pictures_as_Cherries_are_crowned_champions_of_Football_League/|website=Bournemouth Echo|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>

==Colours & crest==
The team's colours have varied slightly throughout the club's history. Starting off playing in red and white stripes, Bournemouth have also played in all-red shirts, red with white sleeves, and mostly, since 1990, in red and black stripes, similar to that of [[A.C. Milan|Milan]].<ref>Redknapp, Harry (2014). "Always Managing". p. 109. Random House</ref> A predominantly red shirt was chosen for the [[2004–05 in English football|2004–05]] and [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] seasons before a return to the stripes for the [[2006–07 in English football|2006–07]] season due to fan demand.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Q&A: All you need to know about AFC Bournemouth – Journalism & News from Bournemouth University|url = http://buzz.bournemouth.ac.uk/faq-afc-bournemouth/|website = Buzz|accessdate = 2015-05-09}}</ref>
