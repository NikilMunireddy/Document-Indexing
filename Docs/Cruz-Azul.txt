'''Cruz Azul Fútbol Club, A.C''', simply called '''Cruz Azul''' ({{IPA-es|kɾus aˈsul|pron}}, "Blue Cross"), is a [[Mexican football league system]] [[association football|football]] club based in [[Mexico City]], which was originally based in the town of Jasso (now part of the "city cooperative" Ciudad Cooperativa Cruz Azul), south of [[Tula de Allende]] in the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Mexico]]. Cruz Azul plays in the top division [[Liga MX]] at its home venue the [[Estadio Azul]], located in the southwestern part of Mexico City in the Colonia Ciudad de los Deportes, adjacent the Nápoles neighborhood. The team moved there in 1996, after playing for many seasons at the [[Estadio Azteca]]. Its headquarters are in La Noria, a suburb within [[Xochimilco]] in the southern part of Mexico City.

They have been the [[Liga MX|Primera División]] champions 8 times, trailing [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]]'s 10, [[C.D. Guadalajara]]'s 11 and [[Club América]]'s 12. Cruz Azul's six titles makes it the second most successful club in the history of the [[CONCACAF Champions League]], the most prestigious international club competition in North American football, trailing Mexico City rivals, Club America.  Cruz Azul was also the first [[CONCACAF#Top clubs|CONCACAF]] team to reach the final of the [[Copa Libertadores]], the most prestigious club competition in South American football (which has invited top Liga MX clubs since 1998), losing on penalties to Argentine football giants [[Boca Juniors]] in [[2001 Copa Libertadores|2001]].  In the 1968–69 season, Cruz Azul became the first CONCACAF club (and fifth worldwide club) to complete a rare [[Treble (association football)#Continental trebles|Continental Treble]], winning the Mexican Primera División championship, the [[Copa MX|Copa México]] national tournament, and the CONCACAF Champions League.

==History==

[[File:Cruz Azul (maquina celeste).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Winning multiple championships in the 1970s earned the [[nickname]] "The Celestial Machine", comparing it with a locomotive.]]
Cruz Azul was founded under the name of '''Club Deportivo Cruz Azul''' as an amateur team on 22 May 1927. The founders were the workers of cement maker [[Cemento Cruz Azul]]; the team played in the town of Jasso (now part of the "city cooperative" [[:es:Ciudad Cooperativa Cruz Azul|Ciudad Cooperativa Cruz Azul]]) in the state of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]]. Cemento Cruz Azul was the only official sponsor until 1997, and remains a primary sponsor through modern times.
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Segundadiv.jpg|thumb|right|300px|the club playing in the [[Segunda División de México]] 1932|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 20 September 2009}}]] -->
[[Guillermo Álvarez Marcia]] and [[Carlos Garcés]] were the main force behind the effort to organize the club, and the quick success of the team led to frequently representing the state of Hidalgo in national amateur tournaments.

From 1927 to 1960, the amateur team played many times in Mexico City against the reserve squads of established professional teams such as América, [[Necaxa]], [[Atlante F.C.]], [[Asturias F.C.]] and [[Club Deportivo Marte]]. Cemento Cruz Azul changed its name to "Cooperativa Cruz Azul", and in 1960 the consistent success of the team caused the new administration of the cement company to build the [[Estadio 10 de Diciembre]] in Jasso. The team entered professional competition in the [[Segunda División de México]] for the 1960–61 season.

Hungarian coach [[Jorge Marik]] stirred the team to the Segunda División championship for the 1963–64 season, elevating them to the Primera División the following season. That season ended with an eighth-place finish. Four years later, Cruz Azul won its first Primera División league tournament, under coach [[Raúl Cárdenas]].

Betweern 1970–1980, Cruz Azul led the Primera División with six league tournament championships; four under Cárdenas and the last two under [[Ignacio Trelles]]. This powerful version of the team earned the nickname ''La Máquina Celeste'' (The Celestial Machine), which continues as one of the unofficial nicknames of the team.

The team earned its eighth and most recent championship in [[Primera División de México Invierno 1997|1997]] under coach [[Luis Fernando Tena]], beating [[Club León|León]] 2–1 on a last minute penalty kick scored by [[Carlos Hermosillo]]. This is still (2015) the quickest that a Primera División club has won eight championships, achieving the feat within 33&nbsp;years of entering the Primera División.

In April 2012, Cruz Azul changed their official name from '''Club Deportivo, Social y Cultural Cruz Azul, A.C.''' to simply '''Cruz Azul Futbol Club, A.C.'''

Cruz Azul televised matches for several years were on [[ESPN Dos]] in Mexico ([[Azteca America]] in the [[United States]]), but in the fall of 2013 they moved to [[Televisa]] in Mexico ([[Univision]] in the U.S.).{{citation needed|reason=no source to prove this|date=August 2015}}

==Copa Libertadores 2001==
{{Main|2001 Copa Libertadores|2001 Copa Libertadores Finals}}
In 2001, Cruz Azul was invited to a tournament between select Mexican and Venezuelan teams that would then compete in the Copa Libertadores, a tournament of the best South American teams. The two best teams of this qualifying tournament earned immediate placement on the roster.

Cruz Azul was one of the seeded teams and reached the 2001 Copa Libertadores final match. Cruz Azul started the tournament in Group 7 along with teams such as Sao Caetano, Defensor Sporting, and Olmedo. Cruz Azul finished as leader of the group with 13 points. In the round of 16 Cruz Azul faced [[Cerro Porteño]]. The first leg was played in Asunción and Cruz Azul lost 2–1. The second leg was played in Mexico and Cruz Azul won the game 3–1. The aggregate score was 4–3 in favor of Cruz Azul and they moved on to the quarterfinals.

In the quarterfinals Cruz Azul faced [[CA River Plate]] of [[Argentina]]. The first leg of the match was played in [[Buenos Aires]] and ended in a 0–0 draw. The second leg was played in Mexico and Cruz Azul won 3–0. Cruz Azul was having a great run and played [[Rosario Central]] in the semifinals. The first leg was played in Mexico and Cruz Azul won the game 2–0. The second leg was played in Rosario in a very exciting match which ended in a 3–3 draw in favor of Cruz Azul due to the 2–0 victory in the first leg.

Cruz Azul in the final match played against the Argentinian club Boca Juniors, Cruz Azul lost at home the first leg 1–0, but came back to win the second leg with the same score, at Boca's [[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|La Bombonera]] stadium with [[Paco Palencia]] scoring the goal. Until then, no team had ever won a Copa Libertadores final match there. After the overtime due to the tie, the championship was decided by penalty kicks, where the more experienced Boca Juniors prevailed. Still, Cruz Azul surprised everybody with the unprecedented feat of reaching the final and defeating established Argentinian teams such as Rosario Central and CA River Plate.

==2006–2007==

In the 2006 Apertura, the team started off great but in the middle of the season, they had a hard time adding points on the board. Cruz Azul recovered and finished the regular season as the points leader. They have not won a title since the championship they won against Leon in 1997. For the Apertura 2006, Cruz Azul made it to the quarterfinals and faced Chivas in the [[Estadio Jalisco]]. In the first leg, Cruz Azul played a very poor game and lost 2–0. On November 25, 2006 Cruz Azul played the second leg at Estadio Azul and played a brilliant game. Cruz Azul started off strong and put Chivas keeper [[Oswaldo Sánchez]] to the test on many occasions. In the middle of the first half, defender [[Salvador Carmona]] pushed a Chivas player in the penalty area and cost Cruz Azul a penalty.[[Ramón Morales]] had no problem and put the score 1–0 in favor of Chivas in the 39th minute. Cruz Azul kept creating opportunities and at the end of the first half, [[César Delgado]] made a great play that [[Richard Núñez]] finished with a goal to tie the game right before halftime in the 45th minute. In the second half, Chivas scored thanks to Ramón Morales again to put the score 2–1 in favor of Chivas. Cruz Azul did not give up and Miguel Sabah tied the game 2–2 in the 62nd minute. Cruz Azul played a great game and ended up tying the game 2–2 but losing 4–2 on aggregate.

In the 2007 Clausura the team had a great start, finishing among the first 8 teams in the league that went to playoffs. The team had a great quarterfinal series against the Tecos of the [[Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara]], thanks to two magnificent goals from striker [[Richard Núñez]] and moved to semifinals against Pachuca FC, the top team in the league. Pachuca beat Cruz Azul in the Estadio Azul in the first leg of the series with a strong 3–1. Cruz Azul still had a chance to overcome the adverse score, but on that same evening, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] communicated that team captain [[Salvador Carmona]] was declared ineligible with immediate and lifetime effect, because of a repeated doping indiscipline that occurred back in January 2006. The sanction was dated May 18, 2007, the very day of the first match against Pachuca. Arguing that player Salvador Carmona did play on that day for Cruz Azul, the Mexican Football Federation, aka Federacion Mexicana de Futbol sanctioned Cruz Azul by suspending the team one game from competition, under the argument of aligning an ineligible player. Many legal arguments have been raised by both the player's lawyer and Cruz Azul, but the sanction stood and Cruz Azul lost its opportunity to overcome the 3–1 and go to the final series against America. Cruz Azul had one of the best seasons of their victory against Mexiel.

==Clausura 2008==

In quarterfinals they played against Jaguares losing 1–0 in the first leg and winning 2–1 in the second leg with goals of [[Pablo Zeballos]] and [[Miguel Sabah]]. They moved to semifinals against San Luis, the first leg was played in San Luis and Cruz Azul won 0–1 with a goal of [[Miguel Sabah]]. In the second leg, Cruz Azul and San Luis played a formidable match that ended 1–1 with goals of [[Eduardo Coudet]] and [[Pablo Zeballos]]. In the final, Cruz Azul played against Santos Laguna, second place in the tournament. The first leg ended 1–2 with a victory for Santos, and in the second leg a 1–1 make Laguna team champions.

They moved to semifinals against Atlante, the first leg was played in Mexico City, and Cruz Azul won 3–1. In the second leg, Cruz Azul and Atlante played a regular match in Cancún, Quintana Roo, that ended 1–1, resulting in Cruz Azul reaching the Final for the second consecutive time in 2008. In the final, Cruz Azul played against Toluca, both teams tied on winning Mexican titles (at that time with 8 each). The first leg played in Mexico City, and ended with a dramatic 0–2 with a victory for visitors, Toluca, and in the second leg, which was played at "Estadio Nemesio Díez". Cruz Azul won 0–2, making the tie on aggregate "2–2", as the match was tied, they played "extra time" and the draw continued until going to the "Penalty&nbsp;– Shoot out", where Toluca won 7–6 over Cruz Azul, Alejandro Vela was the Cruz Azul "villain" because he failed the last "penalty shoot-out", another incident before the match went to "extra time", was a clear foul suffered by Villaluz on the Goal area, the toluca player "Jose Manuel Cruz Alta" crashed with the Cruz Azul player, making him unconscious, but the referee didn't mark the foul even though the Cruz Azul player was knocked out, he didn't even take a red card on the toluca player, (unfortunately Cruz Azul had made his 3 substitutions, so they ended the match playing with only 10 players, an unfair situation, that interfered directly on the final result of the match) this made the Toluca team becoming champions winning their 9th Mexican title, becoming the 3rd most successful of Mexican title winning teams.

==Crest==
[[File:Cruz Azul jerseys.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cruz Azul shirts from 90's and 2000's]]

The club's crest has stayed relatively consistent since its foundation in the 1920s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maquina-azul.com/ |title=Cruz Azul crest history |publisher=Maquina-azul.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref> with a blue cross in a white circle surrounded by a red square, with the club's name above and below. As years went by and titles were won, the crest was modified to proclaim Cruz Azul's achievements, adding a larger blue circle/frame after the [[1971–72 Mexican Primera División season|1971–72 season]] showing three stars for each Liga MX championship win (showing eight stars since the end of the [[Primera División de México Invierno 1997|1997]] season).

==Nicknames==

[[File:Polarhase 1 1997-08-04.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[hare]] is the animal that is used to represent the team.]]
Cruz Azul has a rich variety of nicknames over its history, listed chronologically:

* Cementeros (cement workers): As a result of affiliation with Cruz Azul Cement, the first name refers directly to the employees of the company, as the team originally was formed with them. Over the years, the concept is extended not only to those who worked in the cooperative, but the construction workers in general.
* Liebres ([[hares]]): When the team was promoted to the Primera División in the mid-1960s, the club played a fast and physical game.  These characteristics, coupled with their mostly white uniforms, led fans to compare the players of those years with the hares which abound in the town.  The nickname took hold, and an [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] hare is often used as a mascot and icon to represent Cruz Azul. While some modern fans believe that the mascot is a rabbit, the club's board has officially declared that it is a hare.
* La Máquina (the machine, the [[locomotive]]): This nickname is fed by several sources of inspiration.  One is based on a railway that brought the cement from the Cruz Azul plant, in the former village of Jasso (south of [[Tula de Allende]]), to Mexico City. After moving to Mexico City, Cruz Azul was the most dominant club in Mexico during the 1970s, reinforcing the nickname as a comparison to the image of a locomotive sweeping through their opponents. The name may have been borrowed from the similarly nicknamed [[History of Club Atlético River Plate#1940s: "La Máquina"|River Plate]] club that motored through its opponents in the [[Argentine Primera División]] in the 1940s. It has been suggested that reporter Rugama Angel Fernandez was the first to publish an article with the name La Máquina for Cruz Azul. The nickname has some variations, including The Celestial Machine, The Blue Machine and The Cement Machine.

==The Cheerleaders (Las Celestes)==
The club has its official cheerleading club, which were included as part of the institution since 2004, since then, act as [[cheerleader]]s in the proceedings of the club in their home games before and at halftime.
From its appearance of "Las Celestes" have formed part of the tradition of the club. And the only Mexican team that has as part of their group at their official cheerleaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.resultados-futbol.com/porristas-celestes-rf_36441.jpg |title=Resultados-futbol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref>

==Popularity and rivalries==

===Popularity===
Since its inception, the team had supporters, mainly workers of the cement. After promotion to the Primera División in the 1960s, more people began to follow the team. In the 1970s when the team managed six of their eight titles even more people joined the group of supporters of the team, until now that in this 21st century according to various surveys{{which|date=May 2013}} is the third team with the most supporters in Mexico,{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} behind the Club Guadalajara and América respectively, above the club UNAM.
