'''David''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|eɪ|v|ɪ|d}}; {{Hebrew Name|דָּוִד|David|Dāwîḏ}};<small>[[ISO 259-3]]</small> ''Dawid''; {{lang-grc|Δαυίδ}}; {{lang-la|Davidus, David}}) was the second king of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Kingdom of Israel and Judah]], reigning c.1010-970 BCE.{{sfn|Halpern|2000|p=318}} According to the [[New Testament]], he was an ancestor of [[Jesus]].

Depicted as a valorous warrior of great renown, and a poet and musician credited for composing many of the psalms contained in the [[Book of Psalms]], King David is widely viewed as a righteous and effective king in battle and civil and criminal justice. He is described as a man after [[Yahweh|God]]'s own heart in {{bibleref2|1 Samuel|13:14}} and {{bibleref2|Acts|13:22}}.

==The story of David==
[[File:Samuel e david.jpg|left|thumb|[[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] anoints David, [[Dura Europos]], [[Syria]], 3rd century CE]]
{{anchor|childhood|Jesse|Bethlehem}}

[[Saul]], chosen by God to be king over all Israel, is rejected when he disobeys a divine instruction to slaughter the Amalekites to the last man, woman and child. God sends Samuel to choose a new king from among the sons of [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]]. He find David, the youngest, tending the flocks, and God says, "Rise and anoint him, for this is the one."

Saul is tormented by an evil spirit from the Lord. His courtiers recommend that he send for David, son of Jesse, a man skillful on the lyre and brave in battle. David enters Saul's service, and so pleases the king that he is made one of the royal armour-bearers. When war comes between Israel and the [[Philistines]] the giant [[Goliath]] challenges to the Israelites to send out a champion to face him in single combat. David, sent by his father to bring provisions to his brothers serving in the army, hears the challenge and says that he can defeat Goliath. Refusing the king's offer of the royal armour, he kills Goliath with his [[Sling (weapon)|sling]] and carries his head to Jerusalem. Saul inquires the name of the young hero and David replies that he is the son of [[Jesse]].

Saul fears David's popularity and plots his death, but Israel loves him. Saul's son [[Jonathan (1 Samuel)|Jonathan]] warns David of his father's schemes and David flees, becoming a vassal of the Philistine king [[Achish]] of Gath. When Achish marches against the Israelites his nobles question David's loyalty, and so he is left behind to guard the camp. Jonathan and Saul are killed at [[Mount Gilboa]] and David travels to [[Hebron]], where he is [[Anointing|anointed]] king over Judah. In the north, Saul's son [[Ish-Bosheth]] is anointed king of Israel, and war ensues until Ish-Bosheth is murdered. The assassins bring the head to  David hoping for a reward, but David executes them for their crime. With the death of Saul's son, the elders of Israel come to [[Hebron]] and David is anointed king over all Israel. He conquers  [[Jerusalem]], previously a [[Jebusite]] fortress, and makes it his capital. He brings the [[Ark of the Covenant]] to the city intending to build a temple for God, but the prophet [[Nathan (Prophet)|Nathan]] forbids it, prophesying that the temple would be built by one of his sons. Nathan also prophesies that God has made a covenant with the house of David: "Your throne shall be established forever." David wins more victories over the Philistines, and the [[Moabites]] and [[Hadadezer]] of [[Zobah]] pay tribute.

David seduces [[Bathsheba]], the wife of [[Uriah the Hittite]], and encompasses the death of Uriah "but the thing that David had done displeased the Lord." Nathan prophesies the punishment that shall fall upon him:  "the sword shall never depart from your house," "the son born to you will die," and God will "take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will sleep with your wives in broad daylight." The infant born to Bathsheba dies as Nathan has prophesied. The remaining parts of the prophecy follow. David's son [[Absalom]] rebels, David flees Jerusalem, and Absalom has a tent pitched on the palace roof in which he takes his father's consorts. The rebellion ends at the battle of the [[Wood of Ephraim]]: Absalom's forces are routed, and Absalom is caught by his hair in the branches of a tree and killed by Joab, the commander of David's army. David is grief-stricken and laments, "O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! Would I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!"

When David is old and bedridden, [[Adonijah]], his eldest surviving son and natural heir, declares himself king. Bathsheba and Nathan go to David and obtain his agreement to crown Bathsheba's son [[Solomon]] as king, and so the revolt of Adonijah is put down. David dies at the age of 80, after reigning 40 years, and on his deathbed he counsels Solomon to walk in the ways of God and to kill his father's enemies.

1 Samuel makes David the youngest of the eight sons of [[Jesse]] of Bethlehem. When the story was retold in 1 Chronicles (4th century BCE) he was made the youngest of seven sons and given two sisters, [[Zeruiah]] and [[Abigail (mother of Amasa)|Abigail]]. The [[Book of Ruth]] (possibly also 4th century BCE) traces his ancestry back to [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]] the Moabite. His mother is not named in any book of the Bible, but the [[Talmud]] identifies her as [[Nitzevet]] daughter of Adael.<ref>Talmud Tractate Bava Batra 91a</ref>

David cemented his relations with various political and national groups through marriage.<ref name=Lemaire>Lemaire, Andre. in ''Ancient Israel'', (Hershel Shanks, ed.), Biblical Archaeology Society; Revised edition (1999), ISBN 978-1880317549</ref> He had eight [[King David's wives|wives]]: [[Michal]], the second daughter of [[King Saul]]; [[Ahinoam]] the Jezreelite; [[Abigail]] the Carmelite, previously wife of [[Nabal]]; [[Maachah]], daughter of [[Talmai]], king of [[Geshur]]; [[Haggith]]; [[Abital]]; [[Eglah]]; and [[Bathsheba]].

The [[Book of Chronicles]] lists his sons by various wives and [[concubine]]s. In [[Hebron]], David had six sons: [[Amnon]], by [[Ahinoam]]; [[Daniel (son of David)|Daniel]], by [[Abigail]]; [[Absalom]], by [[Maachah]]; [[Adonijah]], by [[Haggith]]; [[Shephatiah]], by [[Abital]]; and [[Ithream]], by [[Eglah]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|1 Chronicles|3:1–3|NIV}}</ref> By Bathsheba, his sons were [[Shammua]], Shobab, [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] and [[Solomon]]. David's sons born in Jerusalem by other wives included [[Ibhar]], [[Elishua]], [[Eliphelet]], [[Nogah]], [[Nepheg]], Japhia, [[Elishama]] and Eliada.<ref>{{Bibleref2|2 Samuel|5:14–16|NIV}}</ref> [[Jerimoth]], who is not mentioned in any of the genealogies, is mentioned as another of his sons in {{Bibleref2|2 Chronicles|11:18|NIV}}. His daughter [[Tamar (2 Samuel)|Tamar]], by Maachah, is a key character in the incident of her rape by one of her half-brothers.

==Historicity==
[[Image:Tel dan inscription.png|thumb|The [[Tel Dan Stele]]]]

===Archaeology===

The [[Tel Dan Stele]], an [[Arameans|Aramean]] victory [[stele]] (a freestanding, inscribed stone) discovered in 1993 at [[Dan (ancient city)|Tel Dan]] and dated to the late 9th/early 8th centuries BCE, contains the Hebrew phrase {{Hebrew|ביתדוד}} (''bytdwd''), which the majority of scholars translate as "House of David".{{sfn|Pioske|2015|p=180}} The [[Mesha Stele]] from [[Moab]], dating from approximately the same period, may also contain the name David in two places, although this is less certain than the mention in the Tel Dan inscription.{{sfn|Pioske|2015|p=210,fn.18}} Nevertheless, the Tel Dan stele is not evidence that the biblical David was an historical figure.{{sfn|Pfoh|2016|p=100}} His reign is dated the early 10th entury BCE, but the [[Books of Samuel|Book of Samuel]] was probably begun during the  late 7th century and completed a century or more later.{{sfn|Coogan|2007|p=512}}{{sfn|Brettler|2007|p=311}} Separated from the events they describe by at least 300 years, it is difficult to see what reliable knowledge the Biblical authors could have drawn on. Their intention was not, in any case, to record history, but to promote David's reign as inevitable and desirable.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|p=233}} For these reasons there is little about David that is concrete and undisputed.{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=232}}

The archaeological evidence indicates that in the 10th century, the time of David, [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] was sparsely inhabited and that  Jerusalem was no more than a small village; over the following century it slowly evolved from a highland chiefdom to a kingdom, but always overshadowed by the older and more powerful [[kingdom of Israel]] to the north.{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2007|p=26-27}} The Biblical evidence likewise indicates that David's Judah was something less than a full-fledged monarchy: he is often called ''negid'', for example, meaning prince or chief, rather than ''melek'', meaning king, he sets up none of the complex bureaucracy that a kingdom needs(even his army is made up of volunteers), and his followers are largely related to him and from his small home-area around [[Hebron]].{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=220-221}}

===Academic views on the biblical account===
The biblical account about David comes from the [[Books of Samuel]] and the [[Books of Chronicles]]. Chronicles merely retells Samuel from a different theological vantage point, and contains little (if any) information not available there, and the biblical evidence for David is therefore dependent almost exclusively on the material contained in the chapters from 1 Samuel 16 to 1 Kings 2.

Since [[Martin Noth]] put forward his analysis of the [[Deuteronomistic history]], biblical scholars have accepted that these two books form part of a continuous history of Israel, compiled no earlier than the late 7th century BCE, but incorporating earlier works and fragments. Samuel's account of David "seems to have undergone two separate acts of editorial slanting". The original writers show a strong bias against Saul, and in favour of David and Solomon. Many years later the Deuteronomists edited the material in a manner that conveyed their religious message, inserting reports and anecdotes that strengthened their monotheistic doctrine. Some of the materials in Samuel I and II—notably the boundary, allotment and administrative lists—are believed to be very early, since they correspond closely to what we know of the territorial conditions of the late Davidic-early Solomonic period.<ref>Norman K. Gottwald, ''Tribes of Yahweh: A Sociology of the Religion of Liberated Israel, 1250–1050 BCE,'' Continuum 1999 pp.156–157, p.162.</ref>

Beyond this, the full range of possible interpretations is available. The late [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]], in his ''History of Israel'' takes Samuel at face value. [[Donald B. Redford]], however, thinks all reconstructions from biblical sources for the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|United Monarchy]] period are examples of "academic wishful thinking".<ref>Donald B. Redford, ''Egypt, Canaan, and Israel in Ancient Times,'' Princeton University Press, 1992 pp.301–307, p.301.</ref> [[Thomas L. Thompson]] rejects the historicity of the biblical narrative, "The history of Palestine and of its peoples is very different from the Bible's narratives, whatever political claims to the contrary may be. An independent history of Judea during the Iron I and Iron II periods has little room for historicizing readings of the stories of I-II Samuel and I Kings."<ref>{{cite web|author=Thompson TL|title=A view from Copenhagen: Israel and the History of Palestine|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/copenhagen.shtml}}</ref> [[Amihai Mazar]] however, concludes that based on recent archeological findings, like those in [[City of David]], [[Khirbet Qeiyafa]], [[Tel Dan]], [[Tel Rehov]], [[Khirbet en-Nahas]] and others "the deconstruction of United Monarchy and the devaluation of Judah as a state in 9th century is unacceptable interpretation of available historic data". According to Mazar, based on archeological evidences, [[United Monarchy]] can be described as a "state in development".<ref>{{cite book|author=Mazar A|title=Archaeology and the Biblical Narrative: The Case of the United Monarchy|url=http://www.rehov.org/Rehov/publications/Mazar%20-%20The%20United%20%20Monarchy-BZAW2010.pdf}}</ref>

Some studies of David have been written: [[Baruch Halpern]] has pictured David as a lifelong vassal of [[Achish]], the Philistine king of Gath;<ref>Baruch Halpern, "David's Secret Demons", 2001.[http://www.bookreviews.org/pdf/1551_3721.pdf Review of Baruch Halpern's "David's Secret Demons"].</ref> [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman]] have identified as the oldest and most reliable section of Samuel those chapters which describe David as the charismatic leader of a band of outlaws who captures Jerusalem and makes it his capital.<ref>Finkelstein and Silberman, "David and Solomon", 2006. See review [http://www.archaeology.org/0601/reviews/kings.html "Archaeology" magazine].</ref> Steven McKenzie, Associate Professor of the Hebrew Bible at [[Rhodes College]] and author of ''King David: A Biography'', states the belief that David actually came from a wealthy family, was "ambitious and ruthless" and a tyrant who murdered his opponents, including his own sons.<ref name="McKenzie_on_David" />
[[File:Rosselli Triunfo David.jpeg|thumbnail| [[Matteo Rosselli]], The triumphant David. ]]
Critical Bible scholarship holds that the biblical account of David's rise to power is a political apology—an answer to contemporary charges against him, of his involvement in murders and regicide.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baden |first=Joel |date=2014-07-29 |title=The Historical David: The Real Life of an Invented Hero |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=9780062188373 |access-date=2015-03-02}}</ref>

Israel Finkelstein  and Neil Asher Silberman reject the idea that David ruled over a united monarchy, suggesting instead that he ruled only as a chieftain over the southern kingdom of Judah, much smaller than the northern kingdom of Israel at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Finkelstein|first1=Israel|last2=Silberman|first2=Neil Asher|title=The Bible Unearthed.

Jacob L. Wright, Associate Professor of Hebrew Bible at Emory University, has written that the most popular legends about David, including his killing of Goliath, his affair with Bathsheba, and his ruling of a United Kingdom of Israel rather than just Judah, are the creation of those who lived generations after him, in particular those living in the late Persian or Hellenistic period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/07/wri388001.shtml|title=The Bible and Interpretation|work=bibleinterp.com}}</ref>

==David as Psalmist==
While almost half of the [[Psalms]] are headed "A Psalm of David" (though the phrase can also be translated as "to David" or "for David") and tradition identifies several with specific events in David’s life (e.g., [[Psalm 3|Psalms 3]], [[Psalm 7|7]], [[Psalm 18|18]], [[Psalm 34|34]], [[Psalm 51|51]], [[Psalm 52|52]], [[Psalm 54|54]], [[Psalm 56|56]], [[Psalm 57|57]], [[Psalm 59|59]], [[Psalm 60|60]], [[Psalm 63|63]] and [[Psalm 142|142]]),<ref>Commentary on II Samuel 22, The Anchor Bible, Vol. 9. ''II Samuel''. P. Kyle McCarter, Jr., 1984. New York: Doubleday. ISBN 0-385-06808-5</ref> the headings are late additions and no psalm can be attributed to David with certainty.<ref name="McKenzie_on_David">[http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/McKensie_020301.shtml Steven McKenzie, Associate Professor Rhodes College, Memphis, Tennessee].</ref>

Psalm 34 is attributed to David on the occasion of his escape from the Abimelech (king) [[Achish]] by pretending to be insane.<ref>Psalm 34, ''Interlinear NIV Hebrew-English Old Testament.'' Kohlenberger, J.R, 1987. Grand Rapids, Michigan:Zondervan Publishing House  ISBN 0-310-40200-X</ref> According to the narrative in 1 Samuel 21, instead of killing the man who had exacted so many casualties from him, Abimelech allows David to depart, exclaiming, "Am I so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me? Must this man come into my house?"<ref>{{bibleref2|1 Samuel|21:15|NIV}}</ref>

==Rabbinic Judaism==
David is an important figure in [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Many legends have grown around the figure of David. According to one Rabbinic tradition, David was raised as the son of his father Jesse and spent his early years herding his father's sheep in the wilderness while his brothers were in school. Only at his anointing by Samuel—when the oil from Samuel's flask turned to diamonds and pearls—was his true identity as Jesse's son revealed.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

David's adultery with Bathsheba was only an opportunity to demonstrate the power of repentance, and the Talmud states that it was not adultery at all, quoting a Jewish practice of divorce on the eve of battle. Furthermore, according to Talmudic sources, the death of Uriah was not to be considered murder, on the basis that Uriah had committed a capital offense by refusing to obey a direct command from the King.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=82&letter=D#260|title=DAVID - JewishEncyclopedia.com|work=jewishencyclopedia.com}}</ref> However, in tractate Sanhedrin, David expressed remorse over his transgressions and sought forgiveness.  God ultimately forgave David and Bathsheba but would not remove their sins from Scripture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin|pages=107a}}</ref>

According to [[midrashim]], [[Adam]] gave up 70 years of his life for the life of David.<ref>Zohar Bereishis 91b</ref> Also, according to the [[Talmud Yerushalmi]], David was born and died on the Jewish holiday of [[Shavuot]] (Feast of Weeks). His piety was said to be so great that his prayers could bring down things from Heaven.

The concept of the Messiah is important in Christianity. Originally an earthly king ruling by divine appointment ("the anointed one", as the title [[Messiah]] had it), the "son of David" became in the last two pre-Christian centuries the apocalyptic and heavenly one who would deliver Israel and usher in a new kingdom. This was the background to the concept of Messiahship in early Christianity, which interpreted the career of Jesus "by means of the titles and functions assigned to David in the mysticism of the Zion cult, in which he served as priest-king and in which he was the mediator between God and man".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/152497/David "David"] article from ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online''</ref> The early Church believed that "the life of David [foreshadowed] the life of Christ; [[Bethlehem]] is the birthplace of both; the shepherd life of David points out Christ, [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|the Good Shepherd]]; the five stones chosen to slay Goliath are [[Typology (theology)|typical]] of the [[Holy Wounds|five wounds]]; the betrayal by his trusted counsellor, [[Ahitophel|Achitophel]], and the passage over the [[Kidron Valley|Cedron]] remind us of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|Sacred Passion]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], "[[Charlemagne]] thought of himself, and was viewed by his court scholars, as a 'new David'.

In European [[Christian culture]] of the [[Middle Ages]], David was made a member of the [[Nine Worthies]], a group of heroes encapsulating all the ideal qualities of [[chivalry]]. His life was thus proposed as a valuable subject for study by those aspiring to chivalric status. This aspect of David in the Nine Worthies was popularised firstly through literature, and was thereafter adopted as a frequent subject for painters and sculptors.

David was considered as a model ruler and a symbol of the God-ordained monarchy throughout medieval Western Europe and Eastern Christendom.

{{Main|David in Islam}}
David ([[Arabic]] داود, ''Dāwūd'') is a highly important figure in [[Islam]] as one of the major [[prophet]]s sent by [[God]] to guide the [[Israelites]]. David is mentioned several times in the [[Quran]], often with his son [[Solomon]]. The actual Arabic equivalent to the Hebrew Davīd is Dawūd. In the Qur'an: David killed Goliath (2:251), Goliath was a powerful king who used to invade random kingdoms and villages. Goliath was spreading evil and corruption. When David killed Goliath, God granted him kingship and wisdom and enforced it (38:20). David was made God's "[[vicegerent]] on earth" (38:26) and God further gave David sound judgment (21:78; 37:21–24, 26) as well as the [[Psalms]], regarded as books of divine wisdom (4:163; 17:55). The birds and mountains united with David in uttering praise to God (21:79; 34:10; 38:18), while God made iron soft for David ([http://quran.com/34/10, 34:10]), God also instructed David in the art of fashioning chain-mail out of iron ([http://quran.com/21/80 21:80]); an indication of the first use of [[Wrought iron]], this knowledge gave David a major advantage over his [[bronze]] and [[cast iron]]-armed opponents, not to mention the cultural and economic impact. Together with Solomon, David gave judgment in a case of damage to the fields (21:78) and David judged the matter between two disputants in his prayer chamber (38:21–23). Since there is no mention in the Qur'an of the wrong David did to [[Uriah the Hittite|Uriah]] nor any reference to [[Bathsheba]], [[Muslim]]s reject this narrative.<ref>A-Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism, Wheeler, ''David''</ref>

Muslim [[tradition]] and the ''[[hadith]]'' stress David's zeal in daily prayer as well as in [[fasting]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Dawud''</ref> Qur'an commentators, historians and compilers of the numerous ''[[Stories of the Prophets]]'' elaborate upon David's concise Qur'anic narratives and specifically mention David's gift in singing his Psalms as well as his musical and vocal talents. His voice is described as having had a captivating power, weaving its influence not only over man but over all beasts and nature, who would unite with him to praise God.<ref>''Stories of the Prophets'', Ibn Kathir, ''Story of David''</ref>

==Modern art and literature==
<!--(In chronological order)-->

===Literature===
Literary works about David include:
* '''1681-82''' [[John Dryden|Dryden]]'s long poem ''[[Absalom and Achitophel]]'' is an allegory that uses the story of the rebellion of [[Absalom]] against King David as the basis for his satire of the contemporary political situation, including events such as the [[Monmouth Rebellion]] (1685), the [[Popish Plot]] (1678) and the [[Exclusion Crisis]].
* '''1893''' [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] used the story of David and Bathsheba as the main structure for the [[Sherlock Holmes]] story ''[[The Adventure of the Crooked Man]]''. The betrayal of the Crooked Man is paralleled with David's betrayal of Uriah the Hittite, carried out in order to win Bathsheba.
* '''1928''' [[Elmer Davis]]'s novel ''Giant Killer'' retells and embellishes the Biblical story of David, casting David as primarily a poet who managed always to find others to do the "dirty work" of heroism and kingship. In the novel, [[Elhanan son of Jair|Elhanan]] in fact killed Goliath but David claimed the credit; and [[Joab]], David's cousin and general, took it upon himself to make many of the difficult decisions of war and statecraft when David vacillated or wrote poetry instead.
* '''1936''' [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[Absalom, Absalom!]]'' refers to the story of Absalom, David's son; his rebellion against his father and his death at the hands of David's general, Joab. In addition it parallels Absalom's vengeance for the rape of his sister Tamar by his half-brother, Amnon.
* '''1939''' In [[Agatha Christie]]'s novel/play ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' (also known as ''Ten Little Indians''), one character compares his own predicament to the story of David and Uriah.
* '''1946'''  [[Gladys Schmitt]]'s novel ''David the King'' was a richly embellished biography of David's entire life. The book took a risk, especially for its time, in portraying David's relationship with Jonathan as overtly [[homoerotic]], but was ultimately panned by critics as a bland rendition of the title character.
* '''1966''' [[Juan Bosch]], a Dominican political leader and writer, wrote ''David: Biography of a King'', as a realistic portrayal of David's life and political career.
* '''1970''' [[Dan Jacobson]]'s ''The Rape of Tamar'' is an imagined account, by one of David's courtiers Yonadab, of the rape of Tamar by Amnon.
* '''1972''' [[Stefan Heym]] wrote ''The King David Report'', a work of fiction depicting the writings of the Bible historian Ethan, upon King Solomon's orders, of a true and authoritative report on the life of David, Son of Jesse.
* '''1974''' In [[Thomas Burnett Swann]]'s Biblical fantasy novel ''How are the Mighty Fallen'', David and Jonathan are explicitly stated to be lovers. Moreover, Jonathan is a member of a winged semi-human race (possibly [[nephilim]]), one of several such races coexisting with humanity but often persecuted by it.
* '''1980''' [[Malachi Martin]]'s [[Faction (literature)|factional]] novel ''King of Kings: A Novel of the Life of David'' relates the life of David, Adonai's champion in his battle with the Philistine deity Dagon.
* '''1984''' [[Joseph Heller]] wrote a novel based on David called ''[[God Knows (novel)|God Knows]]'', published by Simon & Schuster. Told from the perspective of an aging David, the humanity—rather than the heroism—of various biblical characters is emphasized. The portrayal of David as a man of flaws such as greed, lust, selfishness, and his alienation from God, the falling apart of his family is a distinctly 20th-century interpretation of the events told in the Bible.
* '''1993''' [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''Certain Women'' explores family, the Christian faith, and the nature of God through the story of King David's family and an analogous modern family's saga.
* '''1995''' [[Allan Massie]] wrote ''King David'', a novel about David's career that portrays the king's relationship to Jonathan as sexual.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Kane|first1=Martin|editor1-last=Exum|editor1-first=Jo Cheryl|title=Beyond the Biblical Horizon: The Bible and the Arts|page=86|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AUd28eEXGfoC&lpg=PA80&dq=%22allan%20massie%22%20%22king%20david%22&pg=PA86#v=onepage&q=massie%20jonathan&f=false|accessdate=15 August 2015|chapter=The Biblical King David and His Artistic and Literary Afterlives|isbn=9004112901|year=1999}}</ref>
* '''2007''', '''2010''' "Occupation Duty," a short [[alternate history]] story by [[Harry Turtledove]], published in ''Time Twisters'', (eds. [[Jean Rabe]] and [[Martin H. Greenberg]]), and in ''Atlantis and Other Places'', is set in modern times in a world in which Goliath defeated David, resulting in the state of "Philistinia" having the same function in that world as the [[State of Israel]] has in ours.
* '''2015''' [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning author [[Geraldine Brooks (writer)|Geraldine Brooks]] published a novel about King David, ''[[The Secret Chord]]''.<ref name=Gilbert>{{cite news|last1=Gilbert|first1=Matthew|title=‘The Secret Chord’ by Geraldine Brooks|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2015/10/03/book-review-the-secret-chord-geraldine-brooks/5XqipZWUj40EQVoerjtQmO/story.html|accessdate=4 October 2015|publisher=Boston Globe|date=3 October 2015}}</ref>
