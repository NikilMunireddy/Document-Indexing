'''Imperial War Museums''' ('''IWM''') is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[national museum]] organisation with branches at five locations in [[England]], three of which are in [[London]]. Founded as the Imperial War Museum in 1917, the museum was intended to record the civil and military war effort and sacrifice of Britain and [[British Empire|its Empire]] during the [[First World War]]. The museum's remit has since expanded to include all conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces have been involved since 1914. As of 2012, the museum aims 'to provide for, and to encourage, the study and understanding of the history of modern war and "wartime experience"'.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/corporate |title=About us |author=Imperial War Museums |work=iwm.org.uk |accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref>

Originally housed in [[the Crystal Palace]] at [[Sydenham Hill]], the museum opened to the public in 1920. In 1924 the museum moved to space in the [[Imperial Institute]] in [[South Kensington]], and finally in 1936 the museum acquired a permanent home which was previously the [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] in [[Southwark]]. The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] saw the museum expand both its collections and its terms of reference, but in the post-war period the museum entered a period of decline. The 1960s saw the museum redevelop its Southwark building, now referred to as Imperial War Museum London, which serves as the organisation's corporate [[headquarters]]. During the 1970s the museum began to expand onto other sites. The first, in 1976, was a historic airfield in [[Cambridgeshire]] now referred to as [[Imperial War Museum Duxford|IWM Duxford]]. In 1978 the [[Royal Navy]] cruiser {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}} became a branch of the museum, having previously been preserved for the nation by a private trust. In 1984 the [[Cabinet War Rooms]], an underground wartime command centre, was opened to the public. From the 1980s onwards the museum's Bethlem building underwent a series of multimillion-pound redevelopments, completed in 2000. Finally, 2002 saw the opening of [[Imperial War Museum North|IWM North]] in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]], the fifth branch of the museum and the first in the north of England. In 2011 the museum rebranded itself as IWM, standing for 'Imperial War Museums'.

The museum's collections include [[archives]] of personal and official documents, [[photographs]], [[film]] and [[video]] material, and [[oral history]] recordings; an extensive [[library]], a large [[art]] collection, and examples of military vehicles and aircraft, equipment and other artefacts.

The museum is funded by government grants, charitable donations and revenue generation through commercial activity such as retailing, licensing, and publishing. Admission is free to IWM London and IWM North, but an admission fee is levied at the other branches. The museum is an [[exempt charity]] under the Charities Act 1993 and a [[non-departmental public body]] under the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]. As of January 2012 the Chairman of the Trustees is [[Francis Richards (diplomat)|Sir Francis Richards]]. Since October 2008, the museum's Director General has been [[Diane Lees]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://museu.ms/museum/details/436/imperial-war-museum-london|title = Imperial War Museum London|date = |access-date = |website = Museums - The World Museums Network|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

==History==

===Establishment: 1917–1924===
[[File:Alfred Mond.jpg|alt=Head and shoulders shot of a bald, moustached man looking into the camera.|thumb|Sir Alfred Mond, photographed between 1910 and 1920.]]
On 27 February 1917 [[Alfred Mond, 1st Baron Melchett|Sir Alfred Mond]], a Liberal MP and First Commissioner of Works, wrote to the Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] to propose the establishment of a National War Museum. This proposal was accepted by the [[War cabinet#United Kingdom|War Cabinet]] on 5 March 1917 and the decision announced in [[The Times]] on 26 March. A committee was established, chaired by Mond, to oversee the collection of material to be exhibited in the new museum.<ref>{{cite journal |issn=0022-0094 |author=Kavanagh, Gaynor |journal=[[Journal of Contemporary History]] |title=Museum as Memorial: The origins of the Imperial War Museum |volume=23 |issue=1 |date=January 1988 |jstor=260869 |pages=77–97 [81] |doi=10.1177/002200948802300105}}</ref><ref>'National War Museum. The Collection of Relics And Souvenirs', ''The Times'', 26 March 1917  Issue 41436, page 5 column C</ref>

This National War Museum Committee set about collecting material to illustrate Britain's war effort by dividing into subcommittees examining such subjects as the Army, the Navy, the production of [[munitions]], and [[Women's roles in the World Wars|women's war work]].<ref>Kavanagh 1988 p.82</ref> There was an early appreciation of the need for exhibits to reflect personal experience in order to prevent the collections becoming dead relics. [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|Sir Martin Conway]], the Museum's first Director General, said that exhibits must 'be vitalised by contributions expressive of the action, the experiences, the valour and the endurance of individuals'.<ref>Kavanagh 1988 p.83</ref> The museum's first [[curator]] and secretary was [[Charles ffoulkes]], who had previously been curator of the [[Royal Armouries]] at the [[Tower of London]].<ref>James Mann, ‘ffoulkes, Charles John (1868–1947)’, rev. William Reid, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Oct 2006 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33120, accessed 22 June 2009]</ref> In July 1917 Mond made a visit to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in order to study how best to organise the museum's growing collection. While in France he met French government ministers, and [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Field Marshal Haig]], who reportedly took great interest in his work.<ref>'The War Museum. Sir Alfred Mond's visit to the front', ''The Times'', 24 July 1917, Issue 41538, page 3 column C</ref> In December 1917 the name was changed to the ''Imperial'' War Museum after a resolution from the India and Dominions Committee of the museum.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=v76LEm-Tc2wC&pg=PA145&dq=history+of++Imperial+War+Museum#v=onepage&q=Interim%20Report%20Crawford%20Committee&f=false |title=Museums and the First World War |page=137 |author=Kavanagh, Gaynor |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=1994|isbn=0-7185-1713-X |accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref>

The museum was opened by [[George V|The King]] at [[the Crystal Palace]] on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond addressed the King on behalf of the committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one who took part in the war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice'.<ref>'The Greatest War Memorial. Opening by the King. Human Interest at the Crystal Palace'. ''The Times'', 10 June 1920, Issue 42433, page 11 column D</ref> Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].<ref name="iwm1920"/> While the Act was being debated, some [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliamentarians]] felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and [[Joseph Kenworthy, 10th Baron Strabolgi|Commander Joseph Kenworthy]] MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a penny of public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War'.<ref>Hansard, 12 April 1920 ''Imperial War Museum Bill'' HC Deb 12 April 1920 vol 127 cc1465-9 [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1920/apr/12/imperial-war-museum-bill Hansard 1803–2005] Accessed 22 March 2009.</ref> On the [[August Bank Holiday]] 1920, the first public holiday since the museum's opening, 94,179 visitors were received,<ref name="tpyf">{{cite web |url=http://www.theirpast-yourfuture.org.uk/upload/pdf/Imperial_War_Museum_-_HN.pdf |title=Learning Resources for Teaching History – Key Stages 3 and 4 – The Imperial War Museum |author=Their Past Your Future |date= |work= |publisher=Imperial War Museum |accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref> and by November 1921, 2,290,719 had visited the museum.<ref>'Public And Crystal Palace. Full Benefit Later', ''The Times'', 15 November 1921, Issue 42878, page 5 column D</ref>

===Relocation 1924–1936===
In 1924 the museum moved to the [[Imperial Institute]] building (demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to make way for [[Imperial College]]) in South Kensington. While this location was more central and in a prestigious area for museums, the accommodation itself proved cramped and inadequate<ref>'The Imperial War Museum: Lack of Accommodation',''The Times'' 25 August 1933 Issue 46532, page 13 column E</ref> and in 1936 a new permanent location was found south of the [[River Thames]] in Southwark.

[[File:Imperial Institute.jpg|thumb|left|The Imperial Institute, South Kensington, where the museum was located from 1924–1936]]

The building, designed by [[James Lewis (architect)|James Lewis]]<ref>Peter Leach, ‘Lewis, James (1750/51–1820)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37672 Accessed 12 March 2009]</ref> was the former Bethlem Royal Hospital which had been vacated following the hospital's relocation to Beckenham in Kent. The site was owned by [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]], who had originally intended to demolish the building entirely in order to provide a public park in what was a severely overcrowded area of London. Eventually the central portion of the hospital building was retained while its two extensive wings were removed and the resulting space named [[Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park]], after Lord Rothermere's mother. Sir Martin Conway described the building as '...a fine building, really quite noble building, with a great portico, a distinguishing dome, and two great wings added to it for the accommodation of lunatics no longer required. This particular building can be made to contain our collection admirably, and we shall preserve from destruction quite a fine building which otherwise will disappear'.<ref>Conway was addressing the [[House of Lords]] and his words recorded in [[Hansard]].

===Second World War and after: 1939–1966===
With the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict.<ref>’Imperial War Museum: Collection of war relics’, ''The Times'' 14 May 1940 Issue 48615, page 4 column F</ref> In November 1939, during the so-called '[[Phoney War]]', the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the [[GPO Film Unit]] production ''The First Days'', in which children are seen playing on some of the museum's German artillery pieces captured during the First World War.<ref>{{cite web

The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from [[HMS Lance (1914)|HMS ''Lance'']] (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by [[Victoria Cross]]-winning boy seaman [[Jack Cornwell]].<ref name="charman103">{{cite book |last1=Charman |first1=Terry |title=''A Museum of Man's Greatest Lunatic Folly: The Imperial War Museum and its Commemoration of the Great War 1917–2008'' in A Part of History: Aspects of the British Experience of the First World War |year=2008 |publisher=Continuum  |location=London |isbn=978-0-8264-9813-7 |page=103}}</ref> The museum initially remained open but was closed for the duration of the war in September 1940 with the onset of [[the Blitz]]. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a [[Luftwaffe]] bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a [[Short Type 184|Short Seaplane]], which had flown at the [[Battle of Jutland]], was destroyed.<ref name="IWMLguide2">''Imperial War Museum London'' (guidebook), (London: Imperial War Museum, 2009) pp. 2 ISBN 978-1-904897-95-8</ref> While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school.<ref>{{cite web

These included the submarine fuel pipeline [[Operation Pluto|PLUTO]], the fog dispersal method [[Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation|FIDO]], and flame weapons such as the [[Churchill Crocodile]] and Wasp [[Universal Carrier]].<ref>'Petroleum Warfare Exhibition: Secrets Of Crocodile And Wasp', ''The Times'', 5 October 1945, Issue 50265, page 7 column D</ref> However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946.<ref name="IWMLguide2"/><ref name="Imperial War Museum page 7">'Imperial War Museum: Memorial and Record Of Deeds In Two World Wars', ''The Times'' 31 January 1953 Issue 52534, page 7 column E</ref> A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949.<ref>'New Exhibits In War Museum Galleries Reopened',''The Times'',  31 August 1948, Issue 51164, page 6 column E</ref><ref>‘Relics Of Two World Wars Museum Wing Reopened’, ''The Times'', 23 February 1949, Issue 51313, page 6 column E</ref>

In 1953, with Commonwealth forces engaged in [[Korean war|Korea]] and [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya]] the museum began its current policy of collecting material from all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were involved.<ref name="IWMLguide2"/> However, despite this expansion of remit, the early postwar period was a period of decline for the museum. Dr Noble Frankland, the museum's Director from 1960 to 1982, described the museum's galleries in 1955 as appearing 'dingy and neglected [and in a] dismal state of decay' the museum's 'numerous stunning exhibits' notwithstanding.<ref>Frankland, Noble (1998) ''History at War: The Campaigns of an Historian'' (London: Giles de la Mare) p. 160 ISBN 978-1-900357-10-4</ref>

===Redevelopment and expansion: 1966–2012===
[[File:15inchgunsatImperialWarMuseumLondon.jpg|thumb|15-inch guns outside the museum; the nearer gun from [[HMS Ramillies (07)|HMS ''Ramillies'']], the other from [[HMS Roberts (F40)|HMS ''Roberts'']].]]
In 1966 the Museum's Southwark building was extended to provide collections storage and other facilities, the first major expansion since the Museum had moved to the site. The development also included a purpose-built cinema.<ref>'Cinema For War Films Opens', ''The Times'', 2 November 1966, Issue  56778, page 16 column B</ref> In 1967 the museum acquired a pair of [[BL 15 inch Mk I naval gun|15-inch naval guns]]. One had been mounted on the [[Royal Navy]]'s [[HMS Ramillies (07)|HMS ''Ramillies'']] and the other on both [[HMS Resolution (09)|HMS ''Resolution'']] and [[HMS Roberts (F40)|HMS ''Roberts'']]. Both had been fired in action during the Second World War. They went on permanent display outside the museum in May 1968.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.2492 |title=Naval guns, 15-inch |author=Imperial War Museum |date= |work=archive.iwm.org.uk |publisher= |accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref> The acquisition of these guns, representative of the [[dreadnought]] era of British [[battleship]]s, led the museum to seek to acquire a [[BL 6 inch Mk XXIII naval gun|6-inch]] triple turret that would be representative of a number of classes of British [[cruiser]]s.<ref name="Wingate101">{{cite book |title=In Trust for the Nation: HMS Belfast 1939–1972 |last=Wingate |first=John |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2004 |publisher=Imperial War Museum |location=London |isbn=1-901623-72-6 |page=101}}</ref> This would eventually lead to the preservation of the Royal Navy [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Belfast|C35|6}}, which became a branch of the museum in 1978.<ref>Wingate 2004, p.101–102</ref>

Later in 1968 on 13 October the Museum was attacked by an [[arsonist]], Timothy John Daly, who claimed he was acting in protest against the exhibition of [[militarism]] to children. He caused damage valued at approximately £200,000, not counting the loss of irreplaceable books and documents. On his conviction in 1969 he was sentenced to four years in prison.<ref>Marshall, Rita 'War museum damaged by arson', ''The Times'' 14 October 1968, Issue no. 57381, p. 1</ref><ref>'Museum fire youth gets four years', ''The Times'', 23 January 1969, Issue 57466, page 3 column G</ref>

In 1969 RAF Duxford, a [[Royal Air Force]] fighter airfield in [[Cambridgeshire]] was declared surplus to requirements by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. Needing further space, the museum duly requested permission to use part of the site as temporary storage. The entire site was later transferred to the museum in February 1976 and Duxford, now referred to as [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]] became the museum's first branch.<ref name=Frankland>{{cite book | last = Frankland | first = Noble | title = History at War | publisher = Giles de la Mare | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-1-900357-10-4 | pages = 205–208 }}</ref> Also during the 1970s the government raised the possibility of the museum taking over the historic [[Cabinet War Rooms]] in [[Whitehall]]. The museum was reluctant due to its new commitments related to Duxford and HMS ''Belfast'', but agreed in 1982.<ref name="Holmes"/>

By 1983 the museum was again looking to redevelop the Southwark site and approached engineering firm [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] to plan a phased programme of works that would expand the building's exhibition space, provide appropriate environmental controls to protect collections, and improve facilities for visitors. The following year, in April 1984, the Cabinet War Rooms were opened to the public as a branch of the museum.

The first phase of the works to the Southwark building started in 1986 and were completed in 1989, during which time the museum was closed to the public. The work included the conversion of what was previously the hospital's courtyard into a centrepiece Large Exhibits Gallery. This gallery featured a strengthened ground floor (to support the weight of very heavy exhibits), a first floor [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] and second storey viewing balcony. Into this space were placed tanks, artillery pieces, vehicles, ordnance and aircraft from the First World War to the [[Falklands War]].<ref name=arupjournal>{{cite journal

The second stage of the redevelopment of the Southwark building, during which the museum remained open to the public, was completed in 1994.<ref name=arupjournal/> During the 1990s, while these works were going on, the museum was also seeking to open a branch in the north of England. Seventy-one sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils and in January 1999 the then [[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]] [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]] formally launched a project to construct a new branch of the museum, [[Imperial War Museum North]], in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]].<ref name=Glancey>Glancey, Jonathan (22 April 2002) [[The Guardian]] [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/critic/feature/0,1169,688710,00.html War and peace and quiet].

The following year, 2000, the final phase of the Southwark redevelopment was completed. The development included the installation of the museum's ''Holocaust Exhibition'' which was opened by the Queen on 6 June 2000. This was the first permanent exhibition dedicated to the [[Holocaust]] in a UK museum; its development had taken five years at a cost of £5 million.<ref>For details of the development process of the Holocaust Exhibition see {{cite journal |last1=Bardgett |first1=Suzanne |last2= |first2= |date=June 2000 |title=Exhibiting Hatred |journal=History Today |volume=50 |issue=6 |pages=18–21 |publisher= |doi= |issn=0018-2753 |url= |accessdate= }}.</ref> Two years later, in July 2002, Imperial War Museum North was opened.

====Architecture and layout====
[[File:BethlemSteelEngraving1828.png|thumb|A view of [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] in 1828]]
The museum has occupied the former Bethlem Royal Hospital on [[Lambeth Road]] since 1936. The hospital building was designed by the hospital surveyor, James Lewis, from plans submitted by [[John Peter Gandy|John Gandy]] and other architects, and construction completed in October 1814. The hospital consisted of a range of buildings 580 feet long with a basement and three storeys, parallel to [[Lambeth Road]], with a central entrance under a [[portico]].<ref name=britishhistoryonline/>

The building was substantially altered in 1835 by architect [[Sydney Smirke]]. In order to provide more space, he added blocks at either end of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the [[Lambeth Road]] gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central [[cupola]] was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the [[chapel]] beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.<ref name=britishhistoryonline>

The building remained substantially unchanged until vacated by the hospital in 1930. After the [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] was purchased by [[Lord Rothermere]], the wings were demolished to leave the original central portion (with the dome now appearing disproportionately tall) and Smirke's later wings. When the museum moved into the building in 1936 the ground floor of the central portion was occupied by the principal art gallery, with the east wing housing the Naval gallery and the west wing the Army gallery. The Air Force gallery was housed in the former theatre. The first floor comprised further art galleries (including rooms dedicated to [[William Orpen]] and [[John Lavery]]), a gallery on [[Women's roles in the World Wars|women's war work]], and exhibits relating to transport and signals. The first floor also housed the museum's photograph collection. The second floor housed the museum's library in its west wing, and in the east wing the [[map]] collection and stored pictures and drawings.<ref>'War Museum in Its New Home – Arrangement of the Exhibits', ''The Times'' 16 June 1936, Issue 47402, page 14 column B</ref> This division of exhibits by service, and by civil or military activity, persisted until a wide-ranging redisplay of the galleries from the 1960s onwards. In September 1972 the building received Grade II [[listed building]] status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1385640 |title=Building Details: Imperial War Museum |author=[[English Heritage]] |date= |work=Listed Buildings Online |publisher= |accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>

The original hospital building is now largely occupied by corporate offices. The 1966 extension houses the library, art store, and document archives while the 1980s redevelopments created exhibition space over five floors. The first stage created 8,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of gallery space of which 4,600&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> was new, and the second provided a further 1,600&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=arupjournal/> The final phase, the Southwest Infill, was partly funded by a £12.6 million grant from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]]<ref>Heritage Lottery Fund – [http://www.hlf.org.uk/NR/rdonlyres/B85BA647-2141-45B9-9E64-6797848763E2/0/10WW2FACTSHEET.pdf Second World War 60 Years On: remembering, learning, commemorating] Accessed 10 March 2009.</ref> and provided 5,860m<sup>2</sup> of gallery space and educational facilities over six floors.<ref>Duncan, Sue (29 November 2001) ''The Architects' Journal'' [http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/home/sensitive-choices/185822.article Sensitive choices]. Retrieved 14 July 2009</ref> Before the 2013-14 redevelopment, the basement was occupied by permanent galleries on the First and Second World Wars, and of conflicts after 1945. The ground floor comprised the atrium, cinema, temporary exhibition spaces, and visitor facilities. The first floor included the atrium mezzanine, education facilities, and a permanent gallery, ''Secret War'', exploring [[special forces]], [[espionage]] and [[covert operation]]s. The second floor included the atrium viewing balcony, two art galleries, a temporary exhibition area and the permanent ''Crimes against Humanity'' exhibition. The third floor housed the permanent ''Holocaust Exhibition'', and the fourth floor, a [[vault (architecture)|vaulted]] roof space, accommodated the Lord Ashcroft Gallery. Opened in November 2010 the gallery exhibits the museum's [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) and [[George Cross]] collection, alongside the private VC collection amassed by [[Michael Ashcroft, Baron Ashcroft|Michael Ashcroft]], 241 medals in total.<ref name=arupjournal/><ref>Imperial War Museum (2009) [http://london.iwm.org.uk/upload/pdf/IWML_Floorplan_August_09.pdf Imperial War Museum London map] Accessed 12 April 2010.</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/war+%26+conflict/art312514 |title=Extraordinary stories revealed as the Imperial War Museum opens The Lord Ashcroft Gallery |first=Richard |last=Moss |date=9 November 2010 |publisher=[[Culture24]] |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>

====All Saints Annexe====
In 1989 the museum acquired the All Saints Annexe, a former hospital building in Austral Street off [[West Square]]. The 1867 building, which backs onto [[Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park]], was originally an orphanage opened by local [[philanthropist]] [[Charlotte Sharman]], then later used as a hospital. It houses the museum's photographic, film and sound archives, and offices.<ref>Archives in London and the M25 Area [http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=11830&inst_id=118&nv1=search&nv2= All Saints Hospital].

The site accommodates a number of [[British Army]] regimental museums, including those of the [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] and the [[Royal Anglian Regiment]].

Based on the historic [[Duxford Aerodrome]], the site was originally operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF)  during the [[First World War]]. During the [[Second World War]] Duxford played a prominent role during the [[Battle of Britain]] and was later used by [[United States Army Air Forces]] fighter units in support of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|daylight bombing]] of Germany. Duxford remained an active RAF airfield until 1961. Many of Duxford's original buildings, such as [[hangar]]s used during the Battle of Britain, are still in use. A number of these buildings are of architectural or historic significance and over thirty have [[listed building]] status.<ref name=IWMDhistoric>Imperial War Museum Duxford (2009) [http://duxford.iwm.org.uk/server/show/ConWebDoc.5713 Historic Duxford]. Retrieved 15 September 2009.</ref> The site also features a number of purpose-built exhibition buildings, such as the [[Stirling Prize]]-winning American Air Museum, designed by [[Norman Foster (architect)|Sir Norman Foster]]. The site remains an active airfield and is used by a number of civilian flying companies, and hosts regular [[air show]]s. The site is operated in partnership with [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] and the Duxford Aviation Society, a charity formed in 1975 to preserve [[civil aircraft]] and promote appreciation of British civil aviation history.

===HMS ''Belfast''===
{{Main|HMS Belfast (C35)}}
[[File:Hms belfast.jpg|thumb|left|HMS ''Belfast'' at her berth in the [[Pool of London]]]] HMS ''Belfast'', a [[Town class cruiser (1936)|Town class cruiser]], was launched in 1938 and served throughout the [[Second World War]], participating in the December 1943 [[Battle of North Cape]] and firing some of the first shots of [[Operation Overlord]], the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. She saw further combat in the [[Korean War]]. Expected to be disposed of as scrap after she was decommissioned in 1963, in 1967 efforts were initiated to preserve ''Belfast'' as a museum ship. A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum, the [[National Maritime Museum]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (UK)|Ministry of Defence]] was established, and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical. In 1971 the government decided against preservation, prompting the formation of the private HMS ''Belfast'' Trust to campaign for her to be saved for the nation. The Trust was successful in its efforts, and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971. Brought to London, she was moored on the [[River Thames]] near [[Tower Bridge]] in the [[Pool of London]]. Opened to the public in October 1971 ''Belfast'' became a branch of the Imperial War Museum on 1 March 1978, being acknowledged by the then [[Secretary of State for Education and Science]], [[Shirley Williams]], as 'a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology'.<ref>

The Cabinet War Rooms is an underground complex that served as a British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] building in the [[Whitehall]] area of [[Westminster]], the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the [[surrender of Japan]]. Their historical value was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the War Rooms could be admitted.<ref name=Holmes>Holmes, Richard (2009) ''Churchill’s Bunker: The Secret Headquarters at the Heart of Britain’s Victory'' (London: Profile Books Ltd) p. 193 ISBN 978-1-84668-225-4</ref> The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982,<ref name=Holmes/> a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]]. Thatcher opened the War Rooms in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million.<ref>Kennedy, Maev (9 April 2003) ''[[The Guardian]]'' [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/apr/09/arts.past Restored underground apartments opened to public].

The Imperial War Museum North was opened in [[Trafford]], [[Greater Manchester]] in 2002. It was the first branch of the museum outside southeast England, and the first to be purpose-built as a museum. Designed by [[architect]] [[Daniel Libeskind]], Imperial War Museum North was his first building in Britain. Libeskind’s building, overlooking the [[Manchester Ship Canal]] at [[Salford Quays]], was based on the concept of a [[globe]] shattered by conflict into shards and reassembled.

The museum's Director-General is answerable to the trustees and acts as accounting officer. Since 1917 the museum has had six directors. The first was [[Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington|Sir Martin Conway]], a noted art historian, [[mountaineer]] and explorer. He was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom#Knighthood|knighted]] in 1895 for his efforts to map the [[Karakoram]] mountain range of the [[Himalayas]], and was [[Felix Slade|Slade]] Professor of Fine Arts at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 1901 to 1904. Conway held the post of Director until his death in 1937, when he was succeeded by Leslie Bradley. Bradley had served in the First World War in the [[Middlesex Regiment]] before being invalided out in 1917. He later became acquainted with Charles ffoulkes, who invited him to join the museum where he was initially engaged in assembling the museum's poster collection.<ref>'Mr L. R. Bradley: Former Director of Imperial War Museum' (obituary) ''The Times'' 30 January 1968 p. 8</ref> Bradley retired in 1960 and was succeeded by Dr [[Noble Frankland]]. Frankland had served as a [[navigator]] in [[RAF Bomber Command]], winning a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. While a Cabinet Office official historian he co-authored a controversial official history of the [[Strategic bombing during World War II|RAF strategic air campaign]] against Germany. Frankland retired in 1982 and was succeeded by Dr [[Alan Borg]] who had previously been at the [[Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts]]. In 1995 Borg moved to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and was succeeded by Sir [[Robert Crawford (historian)|Robert Crawford]], who had originally been recruited by Frankland as a research assistant in 1968. Upon Crawford's retirement in 2008 he was succeeded by [[Diane Lees]], previously Director of the [[V&A Museum of Childhood]].
