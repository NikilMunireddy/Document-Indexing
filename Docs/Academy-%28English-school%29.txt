'''Academy schools''' are [[State-funded schools (England)|state-funded schools]] in [[England]] which are directly funded by the [[Department for Education]] and independent of [[local authority]] control. The terms of the arrangements are set out in individual Academy Funding Agreements.<ref name="IndividualFundingAgreements">{{cite web|title=Academy Funding Agreements|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/performance/academiesfa.html|website=School and college performance tables|publisher=DfE|accessdate=20 March 2016}}</ref>

Most academies are [[secondary school]]s. However, some [[primary school]]s, as well as some of the remaining [[first school|first]], [[middle school|middle]] and [[high school]]s, are also academies.

Academies are self-governing [[non-profit]] [[Charitable trusts in English law|charitable trusts]] and may receive additional support from personal or corporate sponsors, either financially or in kind.<ref name=CharityCommission>{{cite web|title=Charities and charity trustees: an introduction for school governors|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Charity_requirements_guidance/Specialist_guidance/Education/introduction_for_school_governors.aspx|work=Charity Commission website|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>  They do not have to follow the [[National Curriculum for England|National Curriculum]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/types-of-school/academies|title=Types of school - Academies|accessdate=16 March 2016}}</ref> but do have to ensure that their curriculum is broad and balanced,<ref name="AcademiesAct2010Section1">{{cite web|title=Academies Act 2010, Section 1|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/32/section/1|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref> and that it includes the core subjects of mathematics and English.<ref name="AcademyFundingAgreement">{{cite web|title=Academy and Free School Master Funding Agreement|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/388471/Academy_and_free_school_-_master_funding_agreement.pdf|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref>  They are subject to inspection by [[Ofsted]].

==Types of academy==
The following are all types of academy:<ref name=AcademyTypes>{{cite web|title=Types of academy|url=http://www.ssatuk.co.uk/ssat/support/academies/about-academies/types-of-academy/|work=SSAT Website|publisher=Specialist Schools and Academies Trust|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

* '''Sponsored academy''': A formerly [[maintained school]] that has been transformed to academy status as part of a government intervention strategy.  They are consequently run by a Government-approved sponsor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Academy sponsorship|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/academy-sponsorship|work=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> They are sometimes referred to as '''traditional academies'''.<ref name=schoolTypes>{{cite web|title=Comparison of Different School Type|url=http://www.newschoolsnetwork.org/sites/default/files/files/pdf/Differences%20across%20school%20types.pdf|work=NSN website|publisher=New Schools Network|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>
* '''Converter academy''': A formerly [[maintained school]] that has ''voluntarily'' converted to academy status. It is not necessary for a converter academy to have a sponsor.<ref name=conversionProcess>{{cite web|title=Academy conversion process|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/academy-conversion-process|work=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>
* '''[[Free school (England)|Free school]]''': Free schools are new academies established since 2011 via the Free School Programme.<ref name=FreeSchoolDefn>{{cite web|title=Education Terms: Free Schools|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/vocabularies/educationtermsandtags/7123|work=DfE Website|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> From May 2015, usage of the term was also extended to new academies set up via a Local Authority competition.<ref name=FreeSchoolPresumption>{{cite web|title=The free school presumption|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/451377/Academy_and_free_school_presumption_departmental_advice_2.pdf|website=Gov.uk|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> The majority of free schools are similar in size and shape to other types of academy. However, the following are distinctive sub-types of free school:<ref name="AcademyTypes"/>

An academy trust that operates more than one academy is known as an '''Academy Chain''', although sometimes the terms '''Academy Group''' or '''Academy Federation''' are used instead.  An Academy Chain is a group of schools working together under a shared academy structure that is either an '''Umbrella Trust''' or a '''Multi-Academy Trust (MAT)'''.<ref name=SSATChains>{{cite web|title=Academy Chains|url=http://www.ssatuk.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Academy-Chains-and-Groups.pdf|work=SSAT UK website|publisher=Specialist Schools and Academies Trust|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=BecomeAcademyDfe>{{cite web|title=Become an academy: information for schools|url=https://www.gov.uk/become-an-academy-information-for-schools|work=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>

An academy with an official [[Faith school|faith designation]] is sometimes referred to as a '''Faith Academy'''.<ref name=FaithAcademy1>{{cite web|title='Faith' academy faces criticism|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4360467.stm|work=BBC News website|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=TelegraphFaithAcademy>{{cite news|last=Ward|first=Victoria|title=Test case could dictate admissions policy in faith schools|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/9681719/Test-case-could-dictate-admissions-policy-in-faith-schools.html|accessdate=4 May 2014|date=15 Nov 2012}}</ref>

==Features of an academy==
All academies are expected to follow a broad and balanced curriculum but many have a particular focus on, or formal [[Specialist schools programme|specialism]] in, one or more areas, such as science; arts; business and enterprise; computing; engineering; mathematics; modern foreign languages; performing arts; sport; or technology.  Although academies are required to follow the [[National Curriculum for England|National Curriculum]] in the core subjects of maths, English and science,<ref name="bedell" /> they are otherwise free to innovate, although they still participate in the same [[Key Stage 3]] and [[GCSE]] exams as other English schools (which effectively means they teach a curriculum very similar to [[maintained school]]s, with small variations).

Like other state funded schools, academies are required to adhere to the National Admissions Code.<ref name=admissionsCode>{{cite web|title=School admissions code|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-admissions-code|work=gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>

In terms of their governance, academies are established as [[companies limited by guarantee]] with a Board of Directors that acts as a Trust.  The '''Academy Trust''' has [[exempt charity]] status, regulated by the Department for Education.<ref name="CharityCommission" /> The trustees are legally, but not financially, accountable for the operation of the academy. The Trust serves as the legal entity of which the school is part.  The trustees oversee the running of the school, sometimes delegating responsibility to a local governing body which they appoint. The day-to-day management of the school is, as in most schools, conducted by the [[Head teacher|Head Teacher]] and their senior management team.

In '''Sponsored Academies''', the sponsor is able to influence the process of establishing the school, including its [[curriculum]], [[ethos]], specialism and building (if a new one is built). The sponsor also has the power to appoint [[school governors|governors]] to the academy's governing body.

==History==
The [[Blair administration|Labour Government under Tony Blair]] established academies through the [[Learning and Skills Act 2000]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2000/00021--i.htm#130 |title=Learning and Skills Act 2000 (c. 21) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> which amended the section of the [[Education Act 1996]] relating to [[City Technology College]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1996/96056-cc.htm |title=Education Act 1996 (c. 56) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> They were first announced in a speech by [[David Blunkett]], then [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills]], in 2000.<ref name=announcement>{{cite news|last=Carvel|first=John|title=Blunkett plans network of city academies|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/mar/15/schools.news|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 Mar 2000}}</ref><ref name=TESAnnouncement>{{cite news|title=Blessed be the school sponsor|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=332257|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=Times Educational Supplement|date=17 Mar 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/925378.stm |title=EDUCATION &#124; 'City academies' to tackle school failure |publisher=BBC News |date=15 September 2000 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> He said that their aim was "to improve pupil performance and break the cycle of low expectations."

The chief architect of the policy was [[Andrew Adonis]] (now Lord Adonis, formerly Secretary of State at the [[Department for Transport]]) in his capacity as education advisor to the Prime Minister in the late 1990s.<ref name="indie_faq">

Academies were known as '''City Academies''' for the first few years, but the term was changed to '''Academies''' by an [[law|amendment]] in the [[Education Act 2002]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2002/20032--j.htm |title=Education Act 2002 (c. 32) |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date=17 August 2011 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref>  The term '''Sponsored Academies''' was applied retrospectively to this type of academy, to distinguish it from other [[Academy (English school)#Types of Academy|types of academy]] that were enabled later.

Sponsored Academies originally needed a ''private'' sponsor who could be an individual (such as [[Sir David Garrard]], who sponsors [[Business Academy Bexley]]) or an organisation (such as the [[United Learning Trust]] or [[Amey plc]]). These sponsors were expected to bring "the best of private-sector best practice and innovative management" to academies, "often in marked contrast to the lack of leadership experienced by the failing schools that academies have replaced" (known as '''predecessor schools''').<ref name=PYB2008>{{cite web|title=BSF — HOW TO SPONSOR AN ACADEMY OR A SPECIALIST SCHOOL. A GUIDE FOR SPONSORS|url=http://www.parliamentaryyearbook2008.co.uk/CP/how-to-sponsor-an-academy.html|work=Parliamentary Year Book 2008|publisher=Blakes|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>  They were originally required to contribute 10% of the academy's capital costs (up to a maximum of £2m).   The remainder of the capital and running costs were met by the state in the usual way for UK state schools through grants funded by the local authority.

The Government later removed the requirement for financial investment by a private sponsor in a move to encourage successful existing schools and charities to become sponsors.

Sponsored Academies typically replaced one or more existing schools, but some were newly established.  They were intended to address the problem of entrenched failure within English schools with low academic achievement, or schools situated in communities with low academic aspirations. Often these schools had been placed in "[[special measures]]" after an Ofsted inspection. They were expected to be creative and innovative because of their financial and academic freedoms, in order to deal with the long-term issues they were intended to solve.<ref name=CH4faqs>{{cite web|title=Q&A: city academies|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/society/education/qa+city+academies/1071547.html|work=Channel 4 News website|publisher=Channel 4|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>

Originally all Sponsored Academies had to have a curriculum specialism within the English [[specialist school|Specialist Schools Programme (SSP)]].<ref name="Standards Site">{{cite web

By May 2010 there were 203 Sponsored Academies in England.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/education/10161371.stm |title=Q&A: Academies and free schools |newspaper=BBC News |date=26 May 2010}}</ref>

The [[Academies Act 2010]] sought to increase the number of academies.  It enabled all maintained schools to convert to academy status, known as '''Converter Academies''' and enabled new academies to be created via the [[Free school (England)|Free School Programme]].

At the same time the new Conservative-led Coalition Government announced that they would redirect funding for school Specialisms [i.e. Technology College Status] into mainstream funding.<ref name=SpecialismChanges>{{cite web|title=Specialist schools programme: Michael Gove announces changes|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/specialist-schools-programme-michael-gove-announces-changes|work=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>   This meant that Secondary Schools would no longer directly receive ring-fenced funds of c£130K from Government for each of their specialisms.<ref name=EveStandSpecialisms>{{cite news|last=Waugh|first=Paul|title=Michael Gove signals end for specialist schools|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/michael-gove-signals-end-for-specialist-schools-6527122.html|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=19 Oct 2010}}</ref>  One way to regain some direct control over their finances was to become a Converter Academy and receive all of their funding direct from Government, with the possibility of buying in services at a cheaper rate.<ref name=BBCFAQ>{{cite web|title=Q&A: Academies|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-13274090|work=BBC News website|publisher=BBC|accessdate=4 May 2014}}</ref>  This, along with some schools wanting more independence from [[local authority]] control, meant that many state secondary schools in England converted to academy status in subsequent years.<ref>"Huge increase in academies takes total to more than 2300", Dept. for Education Press Notice, Sept. 7 2012.

By April 2011, the number of academies had increased to 629, and by August 2011, reached 1070.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/academies/a0069811/schools-submitting-applications-and-academies-that-have-opened-in-201011 |title=Open academies and academy projects in development – The Department for Education |publisher=Education.gov.uk |date=19 August 2011 |accessdate=29 August 2011}}</ref> By July 2012 this number reached 1957, double that of the previous year.<ref name="education.gov.uk">http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/leadership/typesofschools/academies/b00208569/open-academies</ref> and, at 1 November 2013, it stood at 3,444.<ref name="education.gov.uk"/> In March 2016 it was announced that all of England's state schools would become academies by 2022.<ref name="BBCAllSchoolsAcademiesPlan">{{cite news|last1=Sellgren|first1=Katherine|title=Budget sets out academies plan and longer school day|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-35815023|accessdate=18 March 2016|work=BBC News Website|publisher=BBC|date=16 March 2016}}</ref>

There are no academies in Wales, where education policy is devolved to the [[Welsh Assembly]]. To date [2013], the Welsh Government has followed a policy of having no academy-status schools in the country.

The [[Education Funding Agency]] monitors financial management and governance of academies. In March 2016 the [[Perry Beeches The Academy|Perry Beeches The Academy Trust]] multi-academy trust was found to have deleted financial records for £2.5 million of free school meal funding, and that the chief executive was being paid by sub-contractors as well as by the trust. Its schools are likely to be taken over by a new trust.<ref name=guardian-20160328>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/28/perry-beeches-academy-chain-stripped-schools-critical-finance-report |title=Lauded academy chain to be stripped of schools after finances inquiry |author=Richard Adams |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 March 2016 |accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref>

In an article in ''[[The Observer]]'', that regarded many of the Government's claims for academies with scepticism, journalist [[Geraldine Bedell]] conceded that:

The article singles out the cited academy, [[Mossbourne Community Academy]] in [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], as "apparently the most popular [school] in Britain – at least with politicians" and "the top school in the country for value-added results".<ref name="bedell" />

==Criticism of and opposition to the academies scheme==

The introduction of academy schools was opposed, notably by teachers' trade unions and some high-profile members within the Labour Party, such as former party leader [[Neil Kinnock|Lord Kinnock]].<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/mar/23/schools.newschools Teachers' leader slams academy school plan], ''[[The Observer]]'', 23 March 2008.</ref><ref name="Kinnock criticises city academies">{{cite news | title=Kinnock criticises city academies | date=18 April 2006 | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4917808.stm |work=BBC News | accessdate =29 November 2009 }}</ref>

The [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Education & Skills Select Committee]] reported in March 2005 that it would have been wiser to limit the programme to 30 or 50 academies in order to evaluate the results before expanding the programme, and that "the rapid expansion of the Academy policy comes at the expense of rigorous evaluation".<ref>{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmeduski/86/8605.htm#a2 |title=House of Commons – Education and Skills – Fifth Report |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> The Select Committee was concerned that the promising results achieved by some academies may be due to increased exclusions of harder-to-teach pupils. They noted that two [[Middlesbrough]] academies had expelled 61 pupils, compared to just 15 from all other secondary schools in the borough.<ref name="parkinson" />

The programme of creating academies has also been heavily criticised by some for handing schools to private sector entrepreneurs who in many cases have no experience of the education sector – most infamously, the Evangelical Christian car dealer, Sir [[Peter Vardy (businessman)|Peter Vardy]], who has been accused of promoting the teaching of [[creationism]] alongside [[macroevolution]] in his [[Emmanuel Schools Foundation]] academies.<ref name="bedell" /><ref name="harris" /> This is also linked to the wider debate in the education sector as to the benefits or otherwise of the growing role of religion in the school system being promoted by the New Labour government in general, and Tony Blair in particular, with many<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/3901679.stm |title=Education &#124; Faith groups back more academies |publisher=BBC News |date=17 July 2004 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Gaby Hinsliff, political editor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/aug/07/schools.newschools |title=City schools could be front for evangelists &#124; UK news &#124; The Observer |work=The Guardian  |date= 8 August 2005|accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}</ref> academies (one estimate puts it at "more than half"<ref>[http://richarddawkins.net/articles/106 "Root of All Evil?

Former leader of the Labour Party Neil Kinnock has criticised the academies scheme saying that they were a "distortion of choice" and risked creating a "seller's market" with "schools selecting parents and children instead of parents selecting schools".<ref name="Kinnock criticises city academies"/>

The Richard Rose Central Academy in [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], sponsored by Eddie Stobart owner [[Andrew Tinkler]], and local businessman Brian Scowcroft opened in September 2008. By January 2009, there were protests by parents and pupils regarding poor quality education and school facilities. The school was found to be failing<ref name=RoseOfsted/> and was placed in special measures, with the headmaster and chief executive being immediately replaced.<ref name=RosePressRelease>{{cite web | title=Richard Rose Central Academy: Press Release | url=http://www.richardroseacademies.org/central/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=75&Itemid=81 | accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>

The original '''City Academy''' programme was attacked for its expense: it cost on average £25m<ref name="parkinson"/> to build an academy under this scheme, much of which was taken up by the costs of new buildings. Critics contend that this is significantly more than it costs to build a new local authority school.<ref>{{cite web |last=Behr |first=Rafael |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200409200021 |title=How car dealers can run state schools |work=New Statesman  |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> Some [[#Operators|operators]] are paying senior staff six-figure salaries, partly funded by central government.<ref name="guardian pay gbp200k salaries">{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/nov/14/academies-pay-200k-salaries |title=Academies pay £200k salaries |work=The Guardian  |date=14 November 2011 |accessdate=15 November 2011 |author=Shepherd, Jessica |quote=Charities that run chains of academy schools are using public funds to pay senior staff six-figure salaries, with some on £240,000 or more. |location=London}}</ref>

In 2012, the academy scheme was applied to primary schools.  The government began transforming some schools that had been graded Satisfactory or lower by [[Ofsted]] into academies, in some cases removing existing governing bodies and Head Teachers. An example was Downhills Primary School in Haringey, where the Head resisted turning the school into an academy. Ofsted were called in to assess the school, and placed it in [[Special measures|Special Measures]]. The head and the Governing Body were removed and replaced with a Government-appointed board. There was opposition from the school and parents.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-17385311 |work=BBC News |title=Academy row school governors sacked by Michael Gove |date=15 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haringeyindependent.co.uk/news/9592486.Protesting_parents__disgusted__with_Downhills_governors__removal/ |title=Protesting Tottenham parents 'disgusted' with Downhills Primary School governors' removal |deadurl=no |accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref>

A parliamentary report in 2015, entitled "Free Schools and Academies", recommends that "In the meantime the Government should stop exaggerating the success of academies and be cautious about firm conclusions except where the evidence merits it. Academisation is not always successful nor is it the only proven alternative for a struggling school".<ref>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmeduc/258/258.pdf</ref>

==Party policies, and developments since the end of the Labour Government==

The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] has supported the academy proposal from its inception but wants the scheme to go further.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4236354.stm |title=Education &#124; Parents back academies says Blair |publisher=BBC News |date=12 September 2005 |accessdate=21 August 2011}}</ref> This accord was reflected in a remark made by Conservative spokesman [[David Willetts]] in 2006:

In 2004, the [[Liberal Democrats]] were reported as being "split" on the issue and so decided that academies should not be mentioned in the party's education policy.<ref name="libdem_2004">{{cite news|author=Hélène Mulholland in Bournemouth |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/sep/21/libdems2004.liberaldemocrats3 |title=Lib Dems split over city academies &#124; Politics |work=The Guardian |date= 21 September 2004|accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}</ref> The position of [[Phil Willis]], the education spokesman at the time, was summarised as:

{{quote|… there [are] no plans to abolish either city academies or specialist schools if the Lib Dems came to power, though "they would be brought under local authority control".|[[Phil Willis]]|<ref name="libdem_2004" />}}

In 2005, Willis' successor, [[Ed Davey]], argued that academies were creating a "two-tier education system"<ref name="davey">{{cite news|author=Matthew Taylor, education correspondent |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2005/oct/31/uk.newschools |title=City academies accused of deserting poor &#124; Politics |work=The Guardian  |date= 31 October 2005|accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}</ref> and called for the academy programme to be halted until "a proper analysis can be done".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/doubts-grow-over-city-academies-492357.html |title=Doubts grow over city academies – Education News, Education |work=The Independent  |date=28 May 2005 |accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

Academies are supported by all three main political parties,<ref>{{cite news|author=Polly Curtis, education editor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/aug/30/newschools.gcses |title=As 51 academy schools prepare for first day, GCSEs show work still to be done &#124; Education |work=The Guardian  |date= 30 August 2008|accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}</ref> with a further cross-party initiative to extend the programme into primary schools currently being considered.<ref>{{cite news|author=Polly Curtis, education editor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2008/jul/16/schools.newschools |title=Education: Expand academy model into primary sector, says thinktank &#124; Education |work=The Guardian  |date= 16 July 2008|accessdate=21 August 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

In 2010 the [[First Cameron ministry|Conservatives and Liberal Democrats coalition government]] announced plans to expand the academy programme with the [[Academies Act 2010]]. In May 2010 the then Education secretary [[Michael Gove]] wrote to all state schools in England inviting them to opt out of Local Authority control and convert to Academy status. Gove also stated that some academies could be created in time for the new Academic year in September 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10817537 |title=Michael Gove defends academy schools list |author=Angela Harrison |publisher=BBC |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100806162208/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10817537| archivedate= 6 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> By 23 July 2010, 153 schools in England had applied for academy status, lower than the prediction that more than 1,000 would do so.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Shepherd | first = Jessica | last2 = Wintour | first2 = Patrick | title = Michael Gove's academy plan under fire as scale of demand emerges |work=The Guardian  | date = 29 July 2010 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/jul/29/michael-gove-academies-schools-claims | accessdate =31 July 2010 | location=London| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100801033245/http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2010/jul/29/michael-gove-academies-schools-claims| archivedate= 1 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In spite of the expanding Academy programme, in August 2010 Gove announced that 75 existing academy rebuild projects were likely to be scaled back.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10893024 |title=Rebuild plans for 75 schools scaled back |author=Hannah Richardson |publisher=BBC |date=6 August 2010 |accessdate=7 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100806191754/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-10893024| archivedate= 6 August 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Nevertheless, by September 2012, the majority of state secondary schools in England had become Academies.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/apr/05/academies-majority-state-secondary-schools|title=Academies to become a majority among state secondary schools |author=Jessica Shepherd |publisher=Manchester Guardian |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2014| deadurl= no}}</ref> Monthly updated information on existing academies and free schools, and applications in process, is published by the Department for Education.<ref>{{cite web|title=Open academies and academy projects in development|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-academies-and-academy-projects-in-development|work=Gov.uk|publisher=Department for Education|accessdate=21 Feb 2016}}</ref>

==Comparisons==
The city academy programme was originally based on the programme of [[City Technology College]]s (CTCs) created by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government under [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1980s, which were also business-sponsored.

Currently, the Government is encouraging CTCs to convert to academies; several have already done so (for example, Djanogly CTC is now [[Djanogly City Academy]]).

Academies differ from CTCs in several ways; most notably, academies cannot select more than 10% of pupils by ability, whereas CTCs can.

Academies have been compared to US [[charter school]]s,<ref name="smithers">Rebecca Smithers, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 6 July 2005, [http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,5500,1522109,00.html "Hedge fund charity plans city academies"]</ref> which are publicly funded schools largely independent of state and federal control.

=={{visible anchor|Operators}} of academies==
A number of private and charitable organisations run groups of academies. These major operators include [[Absolute Return for Kids|ARK Schools]], [[Academies Enterprise Trust]], [[E-ACT]] (formerly Edutrust Academies Charitable Trust), [[Emmanuel Schools Foundation]], [[Harris Federation]], [[Oasis Trust]], [[Ormiston Academies Trust]], LSSAT Academies Trust and [[United Learning Trust]].
