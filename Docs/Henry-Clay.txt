{{Henry Clay Series}}
'''Henry Clay, Sr.''' (April 12, 1777&nbsp;– June 29, 1852) was an American lawyer and planter, politician, and skilled orator who represented [[Kentucky]] in both the [[United States Senate]] and [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. He served three non-consecutive terms as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] and served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[John Quincy Adams]] from 1825 to 1829. Clay ran for the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]], [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832]] and [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844]], while also seeking the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] nomination in [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840]] and [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848]]. However, he was unsuccessful.

Clay was a dominant figure in both the [[First Party System|First]] and [[Second Party System|Second Party]] systems. As a leading [[war hawk]] in 1812, he favored war with Britain and played a significant role in [[Origins of the War of 1812|leading the nation into]] the [[War of 1812]].<ref name="Eaton25">{{Cite book |title=Henry Clay and the Art of American Politics |last=Eaton |first=Clement |year=1957 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston, MA |page=25}}</ref> In 1824 he ran for president and lost, but maneuvered House voting in favor of [[John Quincy Adams]], who appointed him as Secretary of State. Opposing candidate [[Andrew Jackson]] denounced the actions of Clay and Adams as part of a [[Corrupt Bargain#Election of 1824|"corrupt bargain."]] Clay ran for president again, and lost the general election in 1832, as the candidate of the [[National Republican Party]], and in 1844 as the candidate of the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. He was a strong proponent of the [[American System (economic plan)|American System]], fighting for an increase in tariffs to foster industry in the United States, the use of federal funding to build and maintain infrastructure, and a strong national bank. He opposed the annexation of Texas and "[[Manifest Destiny]]" policy of Democrats, fearing it would inject the slavery issue into politics. This cost him votes in the close [[United States presidential election, 1844|presidential election of 1844]]. Clay later opposed the [[Mexican-American War]].

Known as "The Great Compromiser", Clay brokered important agreements during the [[Nullification Crisis]] and on the [[American slavery|slavery issue]]. As part of the "[[Great Triumvirate]]" or "Immortal Trio," along with his colleagues [[Daniel Webster]] and [[John C. Calhoun]], he was instrumental in formulating the [[Missouri Compromise of 1820]], the [[Tariff of 1833|Compromise Tariff of 1833]], and the [[Compromise of 1850]] to ease sectional tensions. He was viewed as the primary representative of Western interests in this group, and was given the names "Henry of the West" and "The Western Star."<ref>{{Cite book |title=Henry Clay and the Art of American Politics |last=Eaton |first=Clement |year=1957 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston, MA |pages=22, 26}}</ref> As a plantation owner, Clay held slaves during his lifetime, but freed them in his will.<ref name="Biography.com on Henry Clay" />

[[Abraham Lincoln]], the Whig leader in Illinois, was a great admirer of Clay, saying he was "my ideal of a great man." Lincoln wholeheartedly supported Clay's economic programs.<ref>Shearer Davis Bowman, "Comparing Henry Clay and Abraham Lincoln," ''Register of the Kentucky Historical Society''. 106 (Summer–Autumn 2008), 495–512.</ref> In 1957, a Senate Committee selected Clay as one of the five greatest U.S. Senators, along with [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C.

==Early life and education==

===Childhood===
Henry Clay was born on April 12, 1777, at the Clay homestead in [[Hanover County, Virginia]], in a story-and-a-half [[frame house]]. It was an above-average home for a "common" Virginia planter of that time. At the time of his death, Clay's father owned more than 22 slaves, making him part of the [[Planter (American South)|planter class]] in Virginia (those men who owned 20 or more slaves).<ref name="Eaton5">{{Cite book |title=Henry Clay and the Art of American Politics |last=Eaton |first=Clement |authorlink= |year=1957 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston, MA |page=5}}</ref>

Henry was the seventh of nine children of the Reverend John Clay and Elizabeth (née Hudson) Clay.<ref>Van Deusen, 4.</ref> His father, a [[Baptist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] nicknamed "Sir John," died four years after the boy's birth (1781).<ref name="Eaton5"/> The father left Henry and his brothers two slaves each, and his wife 18 slaves and {{convert|464|acre|ha}} of land.<ref name="Eaton6">{{Cite book |title=Henry Clay and the Art of American Politics |last=Eaton |first=Clement |authorlink= |year=1957 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston, MA |page=6}}</ref> Henry Clay was a second cousin of [[Cassius Marcellus Clay (politician)|Cassius Marcellus Clay]], who became a politician and an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] in Kentucky.

The widow Elizabeth Clay married Capt. Henry Watkins, who was an affectionate stepfather. Henry Watkins moved the family to [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of World Biography">[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/henry-clay/ "Henry Clay"], ''Encyclopedia of World Biography''.</ref> Elizabeth had seven more children with Watkins, bearing a total of sixteen.<ref name="Eaton6"/>

===Education===
His stepfather secured Clay employment in the office of the [[Virginia Court of Chancery]], where the youth displayed an aptitude for law. There he became friends with [[George Wythe]]. Hampered by a crippled hand, Wythe chose Clay as his secretary.<ref name="Eaton7">{{Cite book |title=Henry Clay and the Art of American Politics |last=Eaton |first=Clement |authorlink= |year=1957 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston, MA |page=7}}</ref>  After Clay was employed as Wythe's [[amanuensis]] for four years, the chancellor took an active interest in Clay's future; he arranged a position for him with the Virginia attorney general, [[Robert Brooke (Virginia)|Robert Brooke]]. Clay [[reading law|read law]] by working and studying with Wythe, Chancellor of the Commonwealth of Virginia (also a mentor to Thomas Jefferson and John Marshall, among others), and Brooke. Clay was admitted to the bar to practice law in 1797.<ref>{{cite book |title=Henry Clay, Volume 1 |last=Schurz |first=Carl |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYVLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=8–9 |year=1915 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref>

===Marriage and family===
[[File:HenryClayLucretiaHartClay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Henry Clay and his wife, Lucretia (née Hart)]]
After beginning his law career, on April 11, 1799, Clay married Lucretia Hart at the Hart home in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. One of her brothers was [[Nathaniel G. S. Hart]], who later served as a captain in the [[War of 1812]] and was killed in the [[Massacre of the River Raisin]].<ref name="Eaton12"/>

Clay and his wife had eleven children (six daughters and five sons): Henrietta (1800–1801), Theodore (1802–1870), Thomas (1803–1871), Susan (1805–1825), Anne (1807–1835), Lucretia (1809–1823), [[Henry Clay, Jr.|Henry, Jr.]] (1811–1847), Eliza (1813–1825), Laura (1815–1817), [[James Brown Clay]] (1817–1864), and [[John Morrison Clay]] (1821–1887).

Seven of Clay's children died before him. By 1835 all six daughters had died of varying causes, two when very young, two as children, and the last two as young women: from [[whooping cough]], [[yellow fever]], and complications of [[childbirth]], respectively. Henry Clay, Jr. was killed during the [[Mexican–American War]] at the [[Battle of Buena Vista]].

Lucretia Hart Clay survived her husband, dying in 1864 at the age of 83. She is interred with her husband in the vault of his monument at the Lexington Cemetery. Henry and Lucretia Clay were great-grandparents of the [[suffragette]] [[Madeline McDowell Breckinridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.womeninkentucky.com/site/reform/m_breckinridge.html|title=Madeline McDowell Breckenridge (Women in Kentucky – Reform)|publisher=Kentucky Commission on Women |accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref>

==Early law and political career==

===Legal career===
[[File:Henry Clay's law office.jpg|thumb|left|View of Henry Clay's law office (1803-1810), Lexington, Kentucky]]
In November 1797, Clay relocated to [[Lexington, Kentucky]], the growing town near where his parents and siblings then resided in [[Woodford County, Kentucky|Woodford County]]. He soon established a reputation for his legal skills and courtroom oratory.<ref>"Death of Henry Clay: Sketch of His Life and Public Career", ''New York Times''. June 30, 1852, p. 1.</ref> Some of his clients paid him with horses and others with land. Clay came to own town lots and the Kentucky Hotel.

By 1812, Clay owned a productive {{convert|600|acre|adj=on}} [[plantations in the American South|plantation]], which he called "Ashland," and numerous slaves to work the land.<ref name="Biography.com on Henry Clay">[http://www.biography.com/articles/Henry-Clay-9250385 Henry Clay Biography: The Great Compromiser], Biography.com.</ref> He held 60 slaves at the peak of operations, and likely produced [[tobacco]] and [[hemp]], the two chief commodity crops of the [[Bluegrass Region]].

One of Clay's clients was his father-in-law, Colonel Thomas Hart, an early settler of Kentucky and a prominent businessman.<ref name="Eaton12">{{Cite book |title=Henry Clay and the Art of American Politics |last=Eaton |first=Clement |authorlink= |year=1957 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston, MA |page=12}}</ref> Clay's most notable client was [[Aaron Burr]] in 1806, after the US [[United States District Attorney|District Attorney]] [[Joseph Hamilton Daveiss]] indicted him for planning an expedition into [[New Spain|Spanish Territory]] west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Clay and his law partner [[John Allen (soldier)|John Allen]] successfully defended Burr.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kinkead |first=Elizabeth Shelby |title=A history of Kentucky |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zfETAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA111#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=111 |year=1896 |publisher=American book company |accessdate=September 4, 2011}}</ref> Some years later [[Thomas Jefferson]] convinced Clay that Daveiss had been right in his charges. Clay was so upset that many years later, when he met Burr again, Clay refused to shake his hand.<ref name="Eaton15">{{Cite book |title=Henry Clay and the Art of American Politics |last=Eaton |first=Clement |authorlink= |year=1957 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston, MA |page=15}}</ref>

===State legislator===
In 1803, although not old enough to be elected, Clay was appointed a representative of [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] in the [[Kentucky General Assembly]].<ref>Jerry Hensley, ''Henry Clay: Compromise and Ambition'', Outskirts Press, 2013, page 79</ref> As a legislator, Clay advocated a liberal interpretation of the state's constitution and the gradual emancipation of slavery in Kentucky. The political realities of the time forced him to abandon that position, as slaveholders formed the elite in Kentucky.<ref name="Biography.com on Henry Clay" /> Clay also advocated moving the state capitol from [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] to [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]. He defended the Kentucky Insurance Company, which he saved from an attempt in 1804 by [[Felix Grundy]] to repeal its monopolistic charter.<ref>David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Henry Clay: The Essential American''. (2010), pp 48–51.</ref>

===First Senate appointment and eligibility===
Clay's influence in Kentucky state politics was such that in 1806 the Kentucky legislature elected him to the [[United States Senate|Senate seat]] of [[John Breckinridge (U.S. Attorney General)|John Breckinridge]], who had resigned when appointed as US Attorney General. The legislature first chose [[John Adair]] to complete Breckinridge's term, but he had to resign over his alleged role in the [[Burr Conspiracy]].<ref>Smucker, Isaac. [https://books.google.com/books?id=7xcXAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA462&ots=KahQ1ZSt_K&dq=Adair%20appointed%20%22Henry%20Clay%22%20unexpired&pg=PA462#v=onepage&q=Adair%20appointed%20%22Henry%20Clay%22%20unexpired&f=false "Kentucky – Early History"], ''National Magazine: A Monthly Journal of American History'', Volume 12, page 462.</ref> On December 29, 1806, Clay was sworn in as senator, serving for slightly more than two months that first time.<ref name=Schurz />

When elected by the legislature, Clay was below the [[Article One of the United States Constitution|constitutionally required age of thirty]]. His age did not appear to have been noticed by any other Senator, and perhaps not by Clay.<ref name=Schurz>Schurz, Carl.

===Speaker of the State House and duel with Humphrey Marshall===
When Clay returned to Kentucky in 1807, he was elected as the [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the state [[Kentucky House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].<ref name="Online Biography of Henry Clay">[http://www.onlinebiographies.info/cele/clay-h.htm Henry Clay – Famous American Biographies].</ref> On January 3, 1809, Clay introduced a resolution to require members to wear [[Spinning (textiles)|homespun]] suits rather than those made of imported British [[broadcloth]]. Two members voted against the measure. One was [[Humphrey Marshall (Senator)|Humphrey Marshall]], an "aristocratic lawyer who possessed a sarcastic tongue," who had been hostile toward Clay in 1806 during the trial of [[Aaron Burr]].<ref name="Eaton17"/>

On January 4, 1809 Clay and Marshall nearly came to blows on the Assembly floor, and Clay challenged Marshall to a [[duel]]. It was still used as a method of settling disputes of honor. It took place on January 19. Apparently to keep any blood from being spilled in their home state of Kentucky,<ref>Remini (1991), page 55</ref> they had chosen a dueling ground in Indiana, directly across the [[Ohio River]] from what was then [[Shippingport, Kentucky]] and near the mouth of [[Silver Creek (Indiana)|Silver Creek]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Samuel Scott (New Albany Rotary Club) |title=New Albany Suburb Famous Field of Honor in Early Days |url=http://nafclibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/fieldofhonor.pdf |year=c. 1950s |work= |publisher=New Albany Floyd County Public Library |accessdate=April 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Duels at Silver Creek (Historical Series of New Albany)|url=http://nafclibrary.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/3.08-Duels-at-Silver-Creek.pdf|work=Historical Series of New Albany (Volume III,  No. 8)|publisher=New Albany Floyd County Public Library (originally broadcast on Radio Station WLRP/WOW/WHEL)|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Papers of Henry Clay, Volume 1 (1797–1814)|year=1959|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|page=613|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76bJUn8VJWIC&pg=PA613#v=onepage&q&f=false|editor=James F.

They each had three turns to shoot. Clay grazed Marshall once, just below the chest. Marshall hit Clay once in the thigh.

===Second Senate appointment===
In 1810, United States Senator [[Buckner Thruston]] resigned to serve as a judge on the [[United States Circuit Court]], and Clay was again selected by the legislature to fill his seat.

==Speaker of the House==
[[File:Henry Clay.JPG|thumb|Portrait by [[Matthew Harris Jouett]], 1818|right|220px]]

===Early years===
In the summer of 1811, Clay was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]]. He was chosen [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] on the first day of his first session, something never done before or since (except for the [[1st United States Congress|first ever session of Congress back in 1789]]). During the fourteen years following his first election, Clay was re-elected five times to the House and to the speakership.<ref name="Eaton23">{{Cite book |title=Henry Clay and the Art of American Politics |last=Eaton |first=Clement |authorlink= |year=1957 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston, MA |page=23}}</ref> Like other Southern Congressmen, Clay took domestic [[slaves]] to Washington, DC to support his household. They included Aaron and [[Charlotte Dupuy]], their son Charles, and daughter Mary Ann.<ref name=Hathaway>[http://www.hathawaymuseum.org/dupuy.html "Aaron and Charlotte Dupuy"], Isaac Scott Hathaway Museum of Lexington, Kentucky.</ref>

==== Changes as Speaker ====
Before Clay's election as Speaker of the House, the position had been that of a rule enforcer and mediator. Clay made the position one of political power second only to the President of the United States. He immediately appointed members of the [[War Hawk]] faction (of which he was the "guiding spirit")<ref name="Eaton25" /> to all the important committees, effectively giving him control of the House. This was a singular achievement for a 34-year-old House freshman. During his early House service, Clay strongly opposed the creation of a [[First Bank of the United States|National Bank]], in part because of his personal ownership in several small banks in his hometown of Lexington. Later he changed his position. When he was seeking the presidency, Clay gave strong support for the [[Second Bank of the United States]].

==== War Hawks ====
The War Hawks, mostly from the South and the West, strongly supported war against [[Great Britain]] due to British violations of United States maritime rights and impressment of U.S. sailors, while also fearing British designs on U.S. territory in the Old Northwest and wishing to expand. <ref name="Eaton24">{{Cite book |title=Henry Clay and the Art of American Politics |last=Eaton |first=Clement |authorlink= |year=1957 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston, MA |page=24}}</ref> As the Congressional leader of the Democratic-Republican Party, Clay took charge of the agenda, especially as a "[[War Hawk]]." Later, as one of the peace commissioners, Clay helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Ghent]] and signed it on December 24, 1814.<ref name="Biography.com on Henry Clay" /> In 1815, while still in Europe, he helped negotiate a commerce treaty with Great Britain.

==== Work in Liberia ====
Henry Clay helped establish and became president in 1816 of the [[American Colonization Society]], a group that wanted to establish a colony for free American blacks in Africa; it founded [[Monrovia]], in what became [[Liberia]], for that purpose. The group was made up of both abolitionists from the North, who wanted to end slavery, and slaveholders, who wanted to deport [[free people of color|free blacks]] to reduce what they considered a threat to the stability of slave society. On the "amalgamation" of the black and white races, Clay said that "The God of Nature, by the differences of color and physical constitution, has decreed against it."<ref>Eaton (1957) p. 133.</ref> Clay presided at the founding meeting of the ACS on December 21, 1816, at the Davis Hotel in [[Washington, D.C.]] Attendees included [[Robert Finley]], [[James Monroe]], [[Bushrod Washington]], [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Francis Scott Key]], and [[Daniel Webster]].

===The "American System"===
{{Main|American System (economic plan)}}
Henry Clay and [[John C. Calhoun]] helped to pass the [[Tariff of 1816]] as part of the national economic plan Clay called "The [[American System (economic plan)|American System]]," which is rooted in Alexander Hamilton's [[American School (economics)|American School]]. Described later by [[Friedrich List]], it was designed to allow the fledgling American manufacturing sector, largely centered on the eastern seaboard, to compete with British manufacturing through the creation of tariffs.

After the conclusion of the War of 1812, British factories were overwhelming American ports with inexpensive goods. To persuade voters in the western states to support the tariff, Clay advocated federal government support for [[internal improvements]] to infrastructure, principally roads and canals. These internal improvements would be financed by the tariff and by sale of the public lands, prices for which would be kept high to generate revenue. Finally, a national bank would stabilize the currency and serve as the nexus of a truly national financial system.

===Foreign policy===
In foreign policy, Clay was the leading American supporter of independence movements and revolutions in [[Latin America]] after 1817. Between 1821 and 1826, the U.S. recognized all the new countries, except [[Uruguay]] (whose independence was debated and recognized only later). When in 1826 the U.S. was invited to attend the [[Congress of Panama|Columbia Conference]] of new nations, opposition emerged, and the American delegation never arrived. Clay supported the [[Greece|Greek]] independence revolutionaries in 1824 who wished to separate from the [[Ottoman Empire]], an early move into European affairs.

Clay also strongly desired the office of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] in the administration of [[James Monroe]], who was [[United States presidential election, 1824|elected president]] in 1816. When Monroe, largely in an effort to placate New England Federalists, gave the office to [[John Quincy Adams]] instead, Clay became so bitter that he declined Monroe's offer for him to become [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], refused to allow Monroe's inauguration to take place in the House Chamber, and subsequently did not attend Monroe's outdoor inauguration.<ref name="Remini">Remini (1991), 150-151</ref>

===The Missouri Compromise and 1820s===
In 1820 a dispute erupted over the extension of slavery in Missouri Territory. Clay helped settle this dispute by gaining Congressional approval for a plan called the "[[Missouri Compromise]]". It brought in [[Maine]] as a free state and [[Missouri]] as a slave state (thus maintaining the balance in the Senate, which had included 11 free and 11 slave states), and it forbade slavery north of 36° 30' (the northern boundary of [[Arkansas]] and the latitude line) except in Missouri.

==Presidential Election of 1824 and Secretary of State==
{{Main|Election of 1824}}
[[File:Clay-standing.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of Henry Clay]]
By 1824, the unparalleled success of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] had driven all other parties from the field. Four major candidates-Adams, [[Andrew Jackson]], [[William H. Crawford]], and Clay-sought the office of president. Because of the unusually large number of candidates receiving electoral votes, no candidate secured a majority of votes in the [[electoral college]]. According to the terms of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the top three electoral vote-getters advanced to the runoff in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Having finished fourth, Clay was eliminated from contention; the top three were Jackson, Adams, and Crawford. Clay, who was [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], supported Adams, and his endorsement ultimately secured Adams' win in the House.

Clay used his political clout to secure the victory for Adams, who he felt would be both more [[sympathy|sympathetic]] to Clay's political views and more likely to appoint Clay to a cabinet position. When Clay was appointed [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], his maneuver was called a "[[corrupt bargain]]" by many of Jackson's supporters and tarnished Clay's reputation.<ref>Hogan, Margaret. [http://millercenter.org/president/biography/jqadams-campaigns-and-elections John Quincy Adams: Campaigns and Elections: The Campaign and Election of 1824] ''Miller Center.'' Retrieved 30 December 2015.</ref> It also marked the beginning of an intense personal rivalry between Clay and Jackson.

===Slave freedom suit===
{{Main|Charlotte Dupuy}}

As Secretary of State, Clay lived with his family and slaves in [[Decatur House]] on [[Lafayette Square Historic District (Washington, D.C.)|Lafayette Square]]. As he was preparing to return to Lexington in 1829, his slave Charlotte Dupuy sued Clay for her freedom and that of her two children, based on a promise by an earlier owner. Her legal challenge to slavery preceded the more famous [[Dred Scott]] case by 27 years. The "[[freedom suit]]" received a fair amount of attention in the press at the time. Dupuy's attorney gained an order from the court for her to remain in DC until the case was settled, and she worked for wages for 18 months for [[Martin Van Buren]], Clay's successor as Secretary of State and the Decatur House. Clay returned to [[Ashland, the Henry Clay estate|Ashland]] with Aaron, Charles and Mary Ann Dupuy.<ref name="Charlotte Dupuy" /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gy8O2xY8mCUC&pg=PA217#v=onepage&q&f=false David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''Henry Clay: The Essential American''], New York: Random House: 2010, pp. 217–218, accessed 12 May 2011.</ref>

The jury ruled against Dupuy, deciding that any agreement with her previous master Condon did not bear on Clay. Because Dupuy refused to return voluntarily to Kentucky, Clay had his agent arrest her. She was imprisoned in Alexandria, Virginia, before Clay arranged for her transport to [[New Orleans]], where he placed her with his daughter and son-in-law Martin Duralde. Mary Ann Dupuy was sent to join her mother, and they worked as domestic slaves for the Duraldes for another decade.<ref name="Charlotte Dupuy" />

In 1840 Henry Clay finally gave Charlotte and her daughter Mary Ann Dupuy their freedom. He kept her son Charles Dupuy as a personal servant, frequently citing him as an example of how well he treated his slaves. Clay granted Charles Dupuy his freedom in 1844.<ref name="Charlotte Dupuy">[http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/southern-region/decatur-house/charlotte-dupuy.html "Charlotte Dupuy"], 'Half Had Not Been Told Me': African American History of Lafayette Square (1795–1965), National Trust for Historic Preservation, Retrieved 21 April 2009.</ref> While no deed of [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] has been found for Aaron Dupuy, in 1860 he and Charlotte were living together as free black residents in Fayette County, Kentucky. He may have been freed or "given his time" by one of Clay's sons, as Dupuy continued to work at Ashland, for pay.<ref name="Hathaway" />

Today, [[Decatur House]], in Washington, DC, is a [[National Historic Landmark]] and museum on Lafayette Square near the [[White House]] and has exhibits on urban slavery and Charlotte Dupuy's freedom suit against Henry Clay.<ref name="Charlotte Dupuy" />

==Senate career==

===The Nullification Crisis===
{{Main|Nullification Crisis}}
After the passage of the [[Tariff of 1828]], dubbed the "tariff of abominations" which raised tariffs considerably in an attempt to protect fledgling factories built under previous tariff legislation, [[South Carolina]] declared its right to nullify federal tariff legislation and stopped assessing the tariff on imports. It threatened to [[secession#United States|secede]] from the Union if the Federal government tried to enforce the tariff laws. Furious, President Jackson threatened to lead an army to South Carolina and hang any man who refused to obey the law.

The crisis worsened until 1833. Clay was by that time a U.S. Senator again, having been re-elected by [[Kentucky]] in 1831. His return to the U.S. Senate, after 20 years, 8 months, 7 days out of office, marks the fourth longest gap in service to the chamber in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2013/12/04/bob-smith-and-the-12-year-itch/ |title=Bob Smith and the 12-Year Itch |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=December 4, 2013}}</ref>

In 1833, Clay helped to broker a deal in Congress to lower the tariff gradually, known as the [[Compromise Tariff of 1833]].<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/Nullification.html Nullification Proclamation] ''Library of Congress.'' Retrieved May 21, 2016.</ref> This measure helped to preserve the supremacy of the Federal government over the states, but the crisis was indicative of the developing conflict between the northern and southern United States over economics and slavery.

===Opposition to Jackson and creation of Whig Party===
[[File:Clay.png|thumb|Portrait of Henry Clay]]
After the election of [[Andrew Jackson]], Clay led the opposition to Jackson's policies. His supporters included the [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]], who were beginning to identify as "Whigs" in honor of ancestors during the Revolutionary War. They opposed the "tyranny" of Jackson, as their ancestors had opposed the tyranny of [[King George III]]. Clay strongly opposed Jackson's refusal to renew the charter of the [[Second Bank of the United States]], and advocated passage of a resolution to censure Jackson for his actions.

Clay's American System ran into strong opposition from President Jackson's administration. A key point of contention between the two men was over the [[Maysville Road]]. It would authorize federal funding for a project to construct a road linking Lexington and the Ohio River; however all of the road would be inside Kentucky. Jackson vetoed it because he felt that it did not constitute interstate commerce, and he feared it would fund corruption. Jackson opposed using the federal government to promote economic modernization, thereby appealing to his agrarian base that wanted rural expansion but distrusted cities.<ref>Carter Goodrich, "The Revulsion Against Internal Improvements," ''Journal of Economic History'' 10#2 (1950) pp. 145-169 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2113517 in JSTOR]</ref>

===Presidential campaigns===
In [[United States presidential election, 1832|1832]] the [[National Republicans]] unanimously [[U.S. presidential election, 1832|nominated Clay for the presidency]], while the [[United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] nominated the sitting President Jackson. The main issue was the policy of continuing the Second Bank of the United States. Clay lost by a wide margin to the highly popular Jackson (55% to 37%).<ref>Samuel Rhea Gammon, ''The presidential campaign of 1832'' (1922) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=70mTAAAAIAAJ  online free]</ref>

In [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840]], Clay was a candidate for the Whig nomination, but he was defeated at the party convention by supporters of war hero [[William Henry Harrison]]. Harrison was chosen because his war record was attractive, and he was seen as more likely to win than Clay.

In [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844]], Clay was nominated by the Whigs against [[James K. Polk]], the Democratic candidate. Polk won by 170 to 105 electoral votes, carrying 15 of the 26 states. Polk's populist stances on territorial expansion figured prominently—particularly his opinion on US control over the entire [[Oregon Country]] and his support for the annexation of [[Texas]]. Clay opposed annexing Texas on the grounds that it would once again bring the issue of slavery to the forefront of the nation's political dialog and would draw the ire of Mexico, from which Texas had declared its independence in 1836. Despite Polk's populism, the election was close; [[New York]]'s 36 electoral votes proved the difference, and went to Polk by a slim 5,000 vote margin. [[Liberty Party (United States, 1840)|Liberty Party]] candidate [[James G. Birney]] won slightly more than 15,000 votes in New York and likely attracted votes that might have gone to Clay. Clay's warnings about Texas proved prescient. The US annexation of Texas led to the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846–1848) (in which his namesake son died). The North and South came to increased tensions during Polk's Presidency over the extension of slavery into Texas and beyond.<ref>David Zarefsky,  "Henry Clay and the Election of 1844: the Limits of a Rhetoric of Compromise." ''Rhetoric & Public Affairs'' 6#.1 (2003): 79-96. [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v006/6.1zarefsky.html online]</ref>

==Return to the Senate==
After losing the Whig Party presidential nomination to General [[Zachary Taylor]] in [[United States presidential election, 1848|1848]], Clay decided to retire to his Ashland estate in Kentucky. Retired for less than a year, he was in 1849 again elected to the U.S. Senate from Kentucky. During his term, the controversy over the expansion of slavery in new lands had reemerged with the addition of the lands ceded to the United States by [[Mexico]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] at the conclusion of the [[Mexican–American War]]. In 1846, [[David Wilmot]], a Pennsylvania congressman, had proposed preventing the extension of slavery into any of the new territory in a failed proposal referred to as the "[[Wilmot Proviso]]."<ref name="Infoplease - Compromise of 1850">[http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/history/A0813116.html Infoplease: Compromise of 1850].</ref>

===The Compromise of 1850===
{{Main|Compromise of 1850}}
Clay played a central role in designing a compromise in 1850 between North and South to resolve the increasingly dangerous slavery question.  He acquired the help of Illinois Senator [[Stephen Arnold Douglas]], a Democrat, to help guide the measures through Congress and thus prevent civil war.<ref name="Remini (2010)">Remini (2010)</ref>

On January 29, 1850, Clay proposed a series of resolutions, which he considered to reconcile Northern and Southern interests, what would widely be called the [[Compromise of 1850]]. Clay originally intended the resolutions to be voted on separately, but at the urging of southerners he agreed to the creation of a Committee of Thirteen to consider the measures. The committee was formed on April 17. On May 8, as chair of the committee, Clay presented an [[omnibus bill]] linking all of the resolutions.<ref>Eaton (1957) pp. 188–192. Remini (1991) pp. 732–750.</ref><ref>Robert R. Russel, "What was the Compromise of 1850?." ''Journal of Southern History'' 22.3 (1956): 292-309.</ref>  The resolutions included:
* Admission of [[California]] as a free state, ending the balance of free and slave states in the senate.
* Organization of the [[Utah Territory|Utah]] and [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]] territories without any slavery provisions, giving the right to determine whether to allow slavery to the territorial populations.<ref name="Infoplease - Compromise of 1850" />
* Prohibition of the slave trade, not the ownership of slaves, in the [[District of Columbia]].<ref name="Infoplease - Compromise of 1850" />
* A more stringent [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref name="Infoplease - Compromise of 1850" />
* Establishment of boundaries for the state of [[Texas]] in exchange for federal payment of Texas's ten million dollar debt.<ref name="Infoplease - Compromise of 1850" />
* A declaration by Congress that it did not have the authority to interfere with the interstate slave trade.<ref>[[William Y. Thompson]], ''Robert Toombs of Georgia'' ([[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]: [[Louisiana State University Press]], 1966), p. 61.</ref>

The bill was opposed for different reasons by hardliners on both sides. Senator [[John C. Calhoun]], Clay's former ally, composed a speech arguing against the compromise and warning of the possibility of disunion. Calhoun was too ill to read the speech, and Virginia Senator [[James Murray Mason]] did so for him on March 4. Many of the more anti-slavery northerners, such as New York Senator [[William H. Seward]], opposed the compromise as well.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.org/education/history/biographies/william-h-seward.html William H. Seward] ''Civil War Trust.'' Retrieved March 28, 2016.</ref> However, on March 7, [[Daniel Webster]] gave a speech in which he argued in favor of the compromise.<ref>[https://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/mar18.html Today in History: March 18 (John C. Calhoun)] ''Library of Congress.'' Web. Retrieved March 27, 2016.</ref>

The omnibus bill, despite Clay's efforts, failed in a crucial vote on July 31 with the majority of his Whig Party and many Southern Democrats opposed. He announced on the Senate floor the next day that he intended to persevere and pass each individual part of the bill. Clay was physically exhausted; the [[tuberculosis]] that would eventually kill him began to take its toll. Clay left the Senate to recuperate in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], [[Rhode Island]]. Douglas separated the bills and guided them through the Senate.<ref>Eaton (1957) p. 192–193. Remini (1991) pp. 756–759.</ref> President [[Millard Fillmore]], a Whig who took office following the death of Taylor, who had not supported the compromise, signed the bills into law.<ref>[http://millercenter.org/president/biography/fillmore-life-in-brief Millard Fillmore: Life in Brief] ''The Miller Center.'' Web. Retrieved March 27, 2016.</ref>

Clay was given much of the credit for the Compromise's success. It quieted the controversy between Northerners and Southerners over the expansion of slavery, and delayed secession and civil war for another decade. Senator [[Henry S. Foote]] of Mississippi, who had suggested the creation of the Committee of Thirteen, later said, "Had there been one such man in the Congress of the United States as Henry Clay in 1860–'61 there would, I feel sure, have been no civil war."<ref>Remini (1991) pp. 761–762.</ref>

==Death and estate==

Clay continued to serve both the Union and his home state of Kentucky. On June 29, 1852, he died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], at the age of 75.

He was buried in [[Lexington Cemetery]], and [[Theodore Frelinghuysen]], Clay's vice-presidential candidate in the election of 1844, gave the eulogy.<ref>{{cite news |title=Henry Clay.

[[Ashland, the Henry Clay estate|Ashland]], named for the many ash trees on the property, was Clay's plantation and mansion for many years. He held as many as 60 slaves at the peak of the plantation operations. It was there he introduced the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] livestock breed to the United States.

By the time of his death, his only surviving children were sons Theodore, Thomas, [[James Brown Clay]] and [[John Morrison Clay]], who inherited the estate and took portions for use. For several years (1866–1878), James Clay allowed the mansion to be used as a residence for the regent of Kentucky University, forerunner of the [[University of Kentucky]] and present-day [[Transylvania University]]. The mansion and estate were later rebuilt and remodeled by Clay's descendants. John Clay designated his portion of the estate as Ashland Stud, which he devoted to breeding thoroughbred horses.

Maintained and operated as a museum, today Ashland includes {{convert|17|acre}} of the original estate grounds. It is located on Richmond Road ([[U.S. Route 25 in Kentucky|US 25]]) in Lexington. It is open to the public (admission charged).

Henry Clay is credited with introducing the [[mint julep]] drink to Washington, D.C., at the [[Willard Hotel]] during his residence as a senator in the city.<ref>[http://washington.intercontinental.com/washa/dining_03.html "Round Robin Bar"], Willard InterContinental Washington<!-- Bot generated title -->.</ref>
