[[Sri Lankabhimanya]] '''Sir Arthur Charles Clarke''', [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Royal Astronomical Society|FRAS]] <!--<ref>The award of Knight Bachelor carries the title of "Sir" and no [[post-nominal letters]] (see {{cite web| url=http://www.honours.gov.uk/honours/chivalry.aspx |title=Orders of Chivalry |publisher=British Government |accessdate=30 August 2007}}) meaning that the previous post-nominals, "CBE" are also still used.</ref>--> (16 December 1917&nbsp;– 19 March 2008) was a British [[science fiction writer]], science writer and [[futurist]],<ref name=Adams/> inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host.

He is perhaps most famous for being co-writer of the screenplay for the movie ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', widely considered to be one of the most influential films of all time.<ref>Ranked #15 by the [[American Film Institute]]. {{cite web | title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies – 10th Anniversary Edition | url=http://www.afi.com/100years/movies10.aspx | accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref><ref>Ranked #6 by the [[British Film Institute]]. {{cite journal | url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/news/50-greatest-films-all-time | title= The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time |issue= September 2012 |date= 1 August 2012 |journal= [[Sight & Sound]] | accessdate=20 September 2014 | editor-link= Ian Christie (film scholar) | editor-first= Ian | editor-last= Christie}}</ref> His other science fiction writings earned him a number of [[Hugo award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula award|Nebula]] awards, which along with a large readership made him one of the towering figures of science fiction. For many years Clarke, [[Robert A.

Clarke was a lifelong proponent of [[Human spaceflight|space travel]]. In 1934, while still a teenager, he joined the [[British Interplanetary Society]]. In 1945, he proposed a [[satellite]] communication system,<ref>{{cite journal | title= Extra-Terrestrial Relays | author= Clarke, Arthur C. | journal= Wireless World | volume=51 | number= 10 | date= October 1945 | publisher= Iliffe and sons, Ltd. | pages= 305–308 | url= http://lakdiva.org/clarke/1945ww}}</ref> an idea which won him the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Stuart Ballantine Medal]]<ref>{{cite web | title= Arthur C.

Clarke was a science writer, who was both an avid populariser of space travel and a futurist of uncanny ability.  On these subjects he wrote over a dozen books and many essays, which appeared in various popular magazines.  In 1961 he was awarded the [[Kalinga Prize]], an award which is given by [[UNESCO]] for popularizing science. These along with his science fiction writings eventually earned him the moniker "Prophet of the Space Age".<ref>{{cite journal | author= Reddy, John | title= Arthur Clarke: Prophet of the Space Age | journal= Reader's Digest | volume= 9 | number= 564 | date= April 1969}}</ref>

Clarke immigrated to [[Sri Lanka]] in 1956, largely to pursue his interest in [[scuba diving]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.natureseychelles.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=326&Itemid=106 | title = Remembering Arthur C.

Clarke augmented his fame later on in the 1980s, from being the host of several television shows such as ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]''.

He lived in Sri Lanka until his death.<ref>Mintowt-Czyz, Lech and Bird, Steve (18 March 2008) {{wayback |df=yes|title= Science fiction author Arthur C.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Clarke was born in [[Minehead]], [[Somerset]], England,<!--citation needed--> and grew up in nearby [[Bishops Lydeard]]. As a boy, he grew up on a farm enjoying [[astronomy|stargazing]] and reading old American science fiction [[pulp magazine]]s. He received his secondary education at [[Richard Huish College, Taunton|Huish]] [[Grammar school]] in [[Taunton]]. In his teens, he joined the Junior Astronomical Association and contributed to ''Urania'', the society's journal, which was edited in Glasgow by Marion Eadie. At Clarke's request, she added an Astronautics Section, which featured a series of articles by him on spacecraft and space travel. Clarke also contributed pieces to the Debates and Discussions Corner, a counterblast to a ''Urania'' article offering the case against space travel, and also his recollections of the Walt Disney film ''Fantasia''.  He moved to London in 1936 and joined the [[Board of Education]] as a pensions auditor.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=34321|startpage=5798|date=8 September 1936|accessdate=19 March 2008}}</ref>

===World War II===
During [[World War II]] from 1941 to 1946 he served in the [[Royal Air Force]] as a radar specialist and was involved in the [[early-warning radar]] defence system, which contributed to the RAF's success during the [[Battle of Britain]]. Clarke spent most of his wartime service working on [[ground-controlled approach]] (GCA) radar, as documented in the semi-autobiographical ''[[Glide Path]]'', his only non-science-fiction novel. Although GCA did not see much practical use during the war, it proved vital to the [[Berlin Airlift]] of 1948–1949 after several years of development. Clarke initially served in the ranks, and was a [[corporal#United Kingdom|corporal]] instructor on radar at No. 2 Radio School, [[RAF Yatesbury]] in [[Wiltshire]]. He was commissioned as a [[pilot officer]] (technical branch) on 27 May 1943.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=36089|supp=yes|startpage=3162|endpage=3163|date=9 July 1943|accessdate=19 March 2008}}</ref> He was promoted [[flying officer]] on 27 November 1943.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=36271|supp=yes|startpage=5289|date=30 November c1943|accessdate=19 March 2008}}</ref> He was appointed chief training instructor at [[RAF Honiley]] in Warwickshire and was [[Demobilization|demobilised]] with the rank of [[flight lieutenant]].

===Postwar===
After the war he attained a [[first-class degree]] in mathematics and physics from [[King's College London]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Arthur C Clarke 1917–2008|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/news_details.php?news_id=757&year=2008|work=News archive 2008|publisher=Kings College London|accessdate=11 March 2011}}</ref> After this he worked as assistant editor at ''[[Physics Abstracts]]''. Clarke then served as chairman of the [[British Interplanetary Society]] from 1946 to 1947<ref>[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]] Vol 6 (1946)</ref> and again from 1951 to 1953.<ref>Parkinson, B. (2008) (Ed.)'Interplanetary – A History of the British Interplanetary Society', p.93</ref>

Although he was not the originator of the concept of [[geostationary satellite]]s, one of his most important contributions in this field may be his idea that they would be ideal telecommunications relays. He advanced this idea in a paper privately circulated among the core technical members of the British Interplanetary Society in 1945. The concept was published in ''[[Wireless World]]'' in October of that year.<ref name="etrelays">{{cite web |url=http://www.lsi.usp.br/~rbianchi/clarke/ACC.ETRelaysFull.html |title=Arthur C.

The most notable of these may be ''Interplanetary Flight'' (1950), ''The Exploration of Space'' (1951) and ''The Promise of Space'' (1968). In recognition of these contributions, the [[geostationary orbit]] {{convert|36000|km}} above the equator is officially recognised by the [[International Astronomical Union]] as a [[Clarke Orbit]].<ref name="foundation">{{cite web |url=http://www.clarkefoundation.org/acc/biography.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725175711/http://www.clarkefoundation.org/acc/biography.php |archivedate=25 July 2011 |title=Clarke Foundation Biography |accessdate=19 March 2008 }}</ref>

On 20 July 1969 Clarke appeared as a commentator for [[CBS]] for the [[Apollo 11]] moon landing.<ref>{{youtube|xMAmk5Rp1tk|Mondo Cult Presents Walter Cronkite Apollo 11 Interview with Robert A.

====Sexuality====
On a trip to [[Florida]] in 1953<ref name=pegasos/> Clarke met and quickly married Marilyn Mayfield, a 22-year-old American divorcee with a young son. They separated permanently after six months, although the divorce was not finalised until 1964.<ref name="McAleer">McAleer, Neil. "Arthur C. Clarke: The Authorized Biography", Contemporary Books, Chicago, 1992. ISBN 0-8092-3720-2</ref><!-- pp. 93-100 --> "The marriage was incompatible from the beginning", said Clarke.<ref name="McAleer"/><!-- p. 100 --> Clarke never remarried, but was close to a Sri Lankan man, Leslie Ekanayake, whom Clarke called his "only perfect friend of a lifetime", in the dedication to his novel ''[[The Fountains of Paradise]]''.<ref>Full dedication reads: "To the still unfading memory of LESLIE EKANAYAKE (13 JuIy 1947 – 4 July 1977) only perfect friend of a lifetime, in whom were uniquely combined Loyalty, Intelligence and Compassion. When your radiant and loving spirit vanished from this world, the light went out of many lives."</ref> Clarke is buried with Ekanayake, who predeceased him by three decades, in [[Colombo]]'s central cemetery. In his biography of [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[John Baxter (author)|John Baxter]] cites Clarke's homosexuality as a reason why he relocated, due to more tolerant [[LGBT rights in Sri Lanka|laws with regard to homosexuality in Sri Lanka]].<ref>

In an interview in the July 1986 issue of ''Playboy'' magazine, when asked if he had had a bisexual experience, Clarke stated "Of course. Who hasn't?"<ref>{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20110606222725 |url=http://www.playboy.com/articles/arthur-clarke-playboy-interview/index.html?page=2 |title=Clarke's interview in ''Playboy'' magazine }}</ref> In his obituary, Clarke's friend [[Kerry O'Quinn]] wrote: "Yes, Arthur was gay&nbsp;... As [[Isaac Asimov]] once told me, 'I think he simply found he preferred men.' Arthur didn't publicize his sexuality—that wasn't the focus of his life—but if asked, he was open and honest."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tobyjohnson.com/arthurcclarke.html | title = In honor of Sir Arthur C. Clarke | accessdate =18 March 2008}}</ref>

Clarke maintained a vast collection of manuscripts and personal memoirs, maintained by his brother Fred Clarke in Taunton, Somerset, England, and referred to as the "Clarkives". Clarke said that some of his private diaries will not be published until 30 years after his death. When asked why they were sealed, he answered, "Well, there might be all sorts of embarrassing things in them."<ref name=Adams>{{cite web | last= Adams | first= Tim | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/1999/sep/12/sciencefictionfantasyandhorror.arthurcclarke | title= Man on the moon | date= 12 September 1999 | publisher= The Guardian | accessdate= 15 December 2014}}</ref>

===Sri Lanka===
Clarke lived in Sri Lanka from 1956 until his death in 2008, having immigrated there when it was still called [[Ceylon]], first in [[Unawatuna]] on the south coast, and then in [[Colombo]].<ref name=obitnyt/> The Sri Lankan government offered Clarke resident guest status in 1975;<ref name="Arthur C Clark Foundation">{{cite web |title = Sir Arthur Clarke dies at age 90|url=http://www.clarkefoundation.org/news/031808.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509083835/http://www.clarkefoundation.org/news/031808.php |archivedate=9 May 2008 |accessdate=21 March 2012 |publisher=Arthur Clark Foundation|date=19 March 2012 }}</ref> he was so influential that the [[Sri Lanka Air Force]] provided a helicopter to take a visiting Robert Heinlein around the country.<ref name="pournelle198204">{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1982-04/1982_04_BYTE_07-04_Human_Factors_Engineering#page/n213/mode/2up | title=The Osborne 1, Zeke's New Friends, and Spelling Revisited | work=BYTE | date=April 1982 | accessdate=October 19, 2013 | author=Pournelle, Jerry | pages=212}}</ref>

[[File:ABC Clarke predicts internet and PC.ogv|thumb|1974 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] interview with Clarke in which he describes a future of ubiquitous, internet-enabled, personal computers.]]
In the early 1970s Clarke signed a three-book publishing deal, a record for a science-fiction writer at the time. The first of the three was ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' in 1973, which won all the main genre awards<ref name=SFAwards/> and spawned sequels that along with the ''2001'' series formed the backbone of his later career.

In a 1974 taped interview with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], the interviewer asked Clarke how he believed the computer would change the future for the everyday person, and what life would be like around the year 2001. Clarke accurately predicted many things that became reality, including [[online banking]], [[online shopping]], and other now commonplace things. Responding to a question about how the interviewer's son's life would be different, Clarke responded: "He will have, in his own house, not a computer as big as this, [points to nearby computer], but at least, a console through which he can talk, through his local computer and get all the information he needs, for his everyday life, like his bank statements, his theatre reservations, all the information you need in the course of living in our complex modern society, this will be in a compact form in his own house&nbsp;... and he will take it as much for granted as we take the telephone."<ref>{{YouTube|OIRZebE8O84|Arthur C. Clarke Predicts the Internet & PC}}</ref>

In 1986 Clarke was named a [[Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award|Grand Master]] by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]].<ref>{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20110605121120 |url=http://www.sfwa.org/awards/grand.htm |title=SFWA Grand Masters}}</ref>

In 1988 he was diagnosed with [[post-polio syndrome]], having originally contracted [[polio]] in 1962, and needed to use a wheelchair most of the time thereafter.<ref name=obitnyt/> Clarke was for many years a Vice-Patron of the [[British Polio Fellowship]].<ref>[http://www.britishpolio.org.uk/ British Polio Fellowship – Home<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In the 1989 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] Clarke was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) "for services to British cultural interests in Sri Lanka".<ref name=CBE>{{London Gazette|issue=51772|supp=yes|startpage=16|date=16 June 1989|accessdate=19 March 2008}}</ref> The same year he became the first Chancellor of the [[International Space University]], serving from 1989 to 2004.  He also served as Chancellor of [[Moratuwa University]] in Sri Lanka from 1979 to 2002.

In 1994, Clarke appeared in a [[science fiction film]]; he portrayed himself in the telefilm ''[[Without Warning (1994 film)|Without Warning]]'', an American production about an apocalyptic alien first-contact scenario presented in the form of a faux newscast.

Clarke also became active in promoting the protection of gorillas and became a patron of the [[Digit Fund|Gorilla Organization]] which fights for the preservation of [[gorilla]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gorillas.org/arthur_c_clarke |title= Gorilla Organization mourns loss of patron Sir Arthur C Clarke – a true champion for gorillas |date= 27 March 2008 |publisher= Gorilla Organization |location= London |accessdate=5 May 2010}}</ref> When [[tantalum]] mining for cell phone manufacture threatened the gorillas in 2001, he lent his voice to their cause.<ref>{{Wayback |df=yes|date=20110605061229 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-4626572-details/Campaign+for+gorilla-friendly+mobiles/article.do |title=Campaign for gorilla-friendly mobiles - News - This is London<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref>

===Television series host===
In the 1980s Clarke became well known to many for his television programmes ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]'', ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers]]'' and ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe]]''.

===Knighthood===
On 26 May 2000 he was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] "for services to literature" at a ceremony in Colombo.<ref name=BBCknighted /><ref name=LP>[[Letters Patent]] were issued by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] on 16 March 2000 to authorise this.

===Later years===
Although he and his home were unharmed by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] [[tsunami]], his "Arthur C. Clarke Diving School" at [[Hikkaduwa]] was destroyed. He made humanitarian appeals, and the Arthur C. Clarke Foundation worked towards better disaster notification systems.<ref>{{Cite news |author= Sir Arthur C.

Because of his post-polio deficits, which limited his ability to travel and gave him halting speech, most of Clarke's communications in his last years were in the form of recorded addresses. In July 2007, he provided a video address for the [[Heinlein Centennial|Robert A. Heinlein Centennial]] in which he closed his comments with a goodbye to his fans. In September 2007, he provided a video greeting for [[NASA]]'s [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini probe]]'s flyby of [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]] (which plays an important role in the book of ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'').<ref>[http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/videos/video-details.cfm?videoID=160 Video greeting to NASA JPL by Arthur C.

Just hours before Clarke's death a massive [[gamma-ray burst]] (GRB) reached Earth. Known as [[GRB 080319B]], the burst set a new record as the farthest object that could be seen from Earth with the [[naked eye]].<ref name="nasa1">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/brightest_grb.html|title=NASA Satellite Detects Naked-Eye Explosion Halfway Across Universe

==Science fiction writer==
[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1951spr n2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Clarke's novella "The Road to the Sea" was originally published in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1951 as "Seeker of the Sphinx"]]
[[File:If 195305.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Clarke's novelette "[[Jupiter Five]]" was cover-featured on the May 1953 issue of ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'']]
[[File:If 195806.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Clarke's novelette "[[The Songs of Distant Earth]]", the cover story for the June 1958 issue of ''[[If (magazine)|If]]'', was expanded to novel length almost three decades later]]

===Beginnings===
While Clarke had a few stories published in [[fanzine]]s, between 1937 and 1945, his first professional sale appeared in ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' in 1946: "[[Loophole (short story)|Loophole]]" was published in April, while "[[Rescue Party (short story)|Rescue Party]]", his first sale, was published in May.{{efn|[[ISFDB]] catalogues one "Letter" to ''Amazing Stories'' published in 1935, ten more nonfiction items ("Essays") published 1938 to 1945, and five "Shortfiction" published 1937 to 1942.<ref name=isfdb/>}} Along with his writing Clarke briefly worked as assistant editor of ''[[Science Abstracts]]'' (1949) before devoting himself in 1951 to full-time writing.

Clarke began carving out his reputation as a "scientific" science fiction writer with his first science fiction novel, ''[[Against the Fall of Night]]'', published as a novella in 1948. It was very popular and considered ground-breaking work for some of the concepts it contained. Clarke revised and expanded the novella into a full novel which was published in 1953. Clarke would later rewrite and expand this work a third time to become ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' in 1956, which rapidly became a definitive must-read in the field. His third science fiction novel, ''[[Childhood's End]]'' was also published in 1953, cementing his popularity. Clarke capped the first phase of his writing career with his sixth novel ''[[A Fall of Moondust]]'' in 1961, which is also an acknowledged classic of the time period.

During this time, Clarke corresponded with [[C. S. Lewis]] in the 1940s and 1950s and they once met in an Oxford pub, [[Eastgate Hotel|The Eastgate]], to discuss science fiction and space travel. Clarke voiced great praise for Lewis upon his death, saying that the [[The Space Trilogy|Ransom trilogy]] was one of the few works of science fiction that should be considered literature.<ref>{{cite web|title=C.S. Lewis and Arthur C. Clarke|url=http://www.shawnsmallstories.com/tomes-of-lewis/c-s-lewis-and-arthur-c-clarke/|publisher=Shawn Small Stories|accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>

==="The Sentinel"===
[[File:Arthur C, Clarke Amazing 5306.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Clarke as depicted in ''Amazing Stories'' in 1953]]
In 1948 he wrote "[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]" for a [[BBC]] competition. Though the story was rejected, it changed the course of Clarke's career. Not only was it the basis for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', but "The Sentinel" also introduced a more cosmic element to Clarke's work. Many of Clarke's later works feature a technologically advanced but still-prejudiced mankind being confronted by a superior alien intelligence. In the cases of ''[[The City and the Stars]]'' (and its original version, ''Against the Fall of Night''), ''[[Childhood's End]]'', and the ''2001'' series, this encounter produces a conceptual breakthrough that accelerates humanity into the next stage of its evolution. In Clarke's authorised biography, Neil McAleer writes that: "many readers and critics still consider [''Childhood's End''] Arthur C. Clarke's best novel."<ref name="McAleer"/><!-- p. 88 -->

Almost all of his short stories can be found in the book ''[[The Collected Stories of Arthur&nbsp;C. Clarke]]'' (2001).

A collection of early essays was published in ''[[The View from Serendip]]'' (1977), which also included one short piece of fiction, "[[When the Twerms Came]]". Clarke also wrote short stories under the pseudonyms of E.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;O'Brien and Charles Willis.<ref>http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/clarke_arthur_c</ref>

===The "Big Three"===
For much of the later 20th century, Clarke, [[Isaac Asimov]] and [[Robert Heinlein]] were informally known as the "Big Three" of science fiction writers.<ref name=bigthree /> Clarke and Heinlein began writing to each other after ''The Exploration of Space'' was published in 1951, and first met in person the following year. They remained on cordial terms for many years, including visits in the United States and Sri Lanka. In 1984, Clarke testified before Congress against the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI).<ref>The Hard SF Renaissance David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer 2002 novel text/html ISBN 0-312-71129-8 PDF en None None Copyright 2002 by David G. Hartwell and Kathryn Cramer</ref> Later, at the home of [[Larry Niven]] in California, a concerned Heinlein attacked Clarke's views on United States foreign and space policy (especially the SDI), vigorously advocating a strong defence posture. Although the two later reconciled formally, they remained distant until Heinlein's death in 1988.<ref name="McAleer"/><!-- pages 81, 290, 326–329 -->

Clarke and Asimov first met in New York City in 1953, and they traded friendly insults and gibes for decades. They established a verbal agreement, the "Clarke–Asimov Treaty", that when asked who was best, the two would say Clarke was the best science fiction writer and Asimov was the best science writer. In 1972, Clarke put the "treaty" on paper in his dedication to ''Report on Planet Three and Other Speculations''.<ref name="McAleer"/><!-- pages 265–269 --><ref>{{cite web |author= Edward Seiler and John H. Jenkins |title= Isaac Asimov FAQ |work= Isaac Asimov Home Page |year= 1994–2009 |url= http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#others5 |accessdate=26 January 2010}}</ref>

===2001 series of novels===
''2001: A Space Odyssey'', Clarke's most famous work, was extended well beyond the 1968 movie as the [[Space Odyssey]] series. In 1982, Clarke wrote a sequel to ''2001'' titled ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]'', which was [[2010 (film)|made into a film]] in 1984. Clarke wrote two further sequels that have not been adapted into motion pictures: ''[[2061: Odyssey Three]]'' (published in 1987) and ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' (published in 1997).

''2061: Odyssey Three'' involves a visit to [[Halley's Comet]] on its next plunge through the [[Inner Solar System]] and a spaceship crash on the Jovian moon Europa. The whereabouts of astronaut Dave Bowman (the "Star Child"), the artificial intelligence [[HAL 9000]], and the development of native life on Europa, protected by the alien [[monolith (Space Odyssey)|Monolith]], are revealed.

Finally, in ''3001: The Final Odyssey'', [[Frank Poole (astronaut)|astronaut Frank Poole]]'s [[freeze-dried]] body, found by a spaceship beyond the orbit of [[Neptune]], is revived by advanced [[medical science]]. The novel details the threat posed to humanity by the alien monoliths, whose actions are not always as their builders had intended.

===''2001: A Space Odyssey''===

Clarke's first venture into film was the [[Stanley Kubrick]] directed ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. Kubrick and Clarke had met in New York City in 1964 to discuss the possibility of a collaborative film project. As the idea developed, they decided to loosely base the story on Clarke's short story, ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'', written in 1948 as an entry in a BBC short story competition. Originally, Clarke was going to write the screenplay for the film, but Kubrick suggested during one of their [[brainstorming]] meetings that before beginning on the actual script, they should let their imaginations soar free by writing a novel first, on which they would base the film. "This is more or less the way it worked out, though toward the end, novel and screenplay were being written simultaneously, with feedback in both directions. Thus I rewrote some sections after seeing the movie rushes—a rather expensive method of literary creation, which few other authors can have enjoyed."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-clarke19mar19,1,1990610,full.story| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604222033/http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-clarke19mar19,1,1990610,full.story| archivedate=4 June 2011 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Dennis | last=McLellan | title=Arthur C. Clarke, 90; scientific visionary, acclaimed writer of '2001: A Space Odyssey' | date=19 March 2008}}</ref> The novel ended up being published a few months after the release of the movie.

Due to the hectic schedule of the film's production, Kubrick and Clarke had difficulty collaborating on the book. Clarke completed a draft of the novel at the end of 1964 with the plan to publish in 1965 in advance of the film's release in 1966. After many delays the film was released in the spring of 1968, before the book was completed. The book was credited to Clarke alone. Clarke later complained that this had the effect of making the book into a [[Novelization|novelisation]], that Kubrick had manipulated circumstances to downplay Clarke's authorship. For these and other reasons, the details of the story differ slightly from the book to the movie. The film contains little explanation for the events taking place. Clarke, on the other hand, wrote thorough explanations of "cause and effect" for the events in the novel. [[James Randi]] later recounted that upon seeing the premiere of ''2001'', Clarke left the theatre at the intermission in tears, after having watched an eleven-minute scene (which did not make it into general release) where an astronaut is doing nothing more than jogging inside the spaceship, which was Kubrick's idea of showing the audience how boring space travels could be.<ref name="jamesrandionclarke">{{cite web |url=http://itricks.com/randishow/?p=21 |title= Randi shares some stories regarding his friend Arthur C.

In 1972, Clarke published ''The Lost Worlds of 2001'', which included his accounts of the production, and alternate versions of key scenes. The "special edition" of the novel ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|A Space Odyssey]]'' (released in 1999) contains an introduction by Clarke in which he documents the events leading to the release of the novel and film.

===''2010: Odyssey Two''===
In 1982 Clarke continued the ''2001'' epic with a sequel, ''[[2010: Odyssey Two]]''. This novel was also made into a film, ''[[2010 (film)|2010]]'', directed by [[Peter Hyams]] for release in 1984. Because of the political environment in America in the 1980s, the film presents a [[Cold War]] theme, with the looming tensions of [[nuclear warfare]] not featured in the novel. The film was not considered to be as revolutionary or artistic as ''2001'', but the reviews were still positive.

Clarke's email correspondence with Hyams was published in 1984.<ref>Arthur C. Clarke and Peter Hyams. [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_KPAAAACAAJ&dq=The+odyssey+file The Odyssey File]. Ballantine Books, 1984.</ref><ref>[http://www.davidrothman.com/jungle.html Excerpt from ''The Odyssey File''.]</ref> Titled ''The Odyssey File: The Making of 2010'', and co-authored with Hyams, it illustrates his fascination with the then-pioneering medium of email and its use for them to communicate on an almost daily basis at the time of planning and production of the film while living on opposite sides of the world. The book also included Clarke's personal list of the best science-fiction films ever made.

Clarke appeared in the film, first as the man feeding the pigeons while [[Heywood R. Floyd|Dr. Heywood Floyd]] is engaged in a conversation in front of the White House. Later, in the hospital scene with [[David Bowman (Space Odyssey)|David Bowman]]'s mother, an image of the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' portrays Clarke as the American President and Kubrick as the Soviet Premier.

===''Rendezvous with Rama''===
Clarke's award-winning novel ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'' (1972) was [[option (filmmaking)|optioned for filmmaking]] decades ago, but this motion picture is in "[[development hell]]" as of 2014. In the early 2000s, the actor [[Morgan Freeman]] expressed his desire to produce a movie based on ''Rendezvous with Rama''. After a drawn-out development process – which Freeman attributed to difficulties in getting financing – it appeared that in 2003 this project might be proceeding, but this is very dubious.<ref>{{cite web

==Science writer==
During his life Clarke published a number of non-fiction books with essays, speeches, addresses, etc. Several of his non-fiction books are composed of chapters that can stand on their own as separate essays.

===Space travel===
In particular, Clarke was a populariser of the concept of space travel. In 1950 he wrote ''[[Interplanetary Flight]]'', a book outlining the basics of space flight for laymen. Later books about space travel included ''The Exploration of Space'' (1951), ''The Challenge of the Spaceship'' (1959), ''Voices from the Sky'' (1965), ''The Promise of Space'' (1968, rev. ed. 1970) and ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) among others.

===Futurism===
His books on space travel usually included chapters about other aspects of science and technology, such as computers and bioengineering.  He predicted telecommunication satellites (albeit serviced by astronauts in space suits, who would replace the satellite's [[vacuum tube]]s as they burned out).<ref>{{cite book | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dTwIDun4MroC&pg=PA604&lpg=PA604&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage | title= Handbook of Space Engineering, Archaeology, and Heritage | editor= Darrin, Ann; O'Leary, Beth L. | publisher= CRC Press | date= 26 June 2009 | page= 604}}</ref>

His many predictions culminated in 1958 when he began a series of magazine essays that eventually became ''Profiles of the Future,'' published in book form in 1962.
<ref name="profiles">''Profiles of the Future'' (1962, rev. eds. 1973, 1983, and 1999, Millennium edition with a new preface)</ref> A timetable<ref name="digitallantern">{{cite web |url=http://www.digitallantern.net/McLuhan/course/spring96/profiles.gif |title=Chart of the Future |accessdate=8 February 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070224092756/http://www.digitallantern.net/mcluhan/course/spring96/profiles.gif| archivedate= 24 February 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> up to the year 2100 describes inventions and ideas including such things as a "global library" for 2005. The same work also contained "Clarke's First Law" and text that became [[Clarke's three laws]] in later editions.<ref name="McAleer"/><!-- p. 169 -->

In a 1959 essay Clarke predicted global satellite TV broadcasts that would cross national boundaries indiscriminately and would bring hundreds of channels available anywhere in the world. He also envisioned a "personal transceiver, so small and compact that every man carries one." He wrote: "the time will come when we will be able to call a person anywhere on Earth merely by dialling a number." Such a device would also, in Clarke's vision, include means for global positioning so that "no one need ever again be lost." Later, in ''Profiles of the Future'', he predicted the advent of such a device taking place in the mid-1980s.<ref name="profiles"/>

An extensive selection of Clarke's essays and book chapters (from 1934 to 1998; 110 pieces, 63 of them previously uncollected in his books) can be found in the book ''Greetings, Carbon-Based Bipeds!'' (2000), together with a new introduction and many prefatory notes. Another fine collection of essays, all previously collected, is ''By Space Possessed'' (1993). Clarke's technical papers, together with several essays and extensive autobiographical material, are collected in ''Ascent to Orbit: A Scientific Autobiography'' (1984).

==Geostationary communications satellite==
[[File:Geostat.gif|thumb|[[Geostationary orbit]]]]
{{Main|Geostationary orbit}}
Clarke contributed to the popularity of the idea that [[geostationary satellite]]s would be ideal telecommunications relays.  He first described this in a letter to the editor of ''[[Wireless World]]'' in February 1945<ref>'Clarke, A. C. (1945) V2 for Ionosphere Research? Wireless World, (February), p. 45</ref> and elaborated on this concept in a paper titled ''Extra-Terrestrial Relays – Can Rocket Stations Give Worldwide Radio Coverage?'', published in ''Wireless World'' in October 1945.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Arthur C.

It is not clear that this article was actually the inspiration for the modern telecommunications satellite. According to [[John R. Pierce]], of [[Bell Labs]], who was involved in the [[Echo satellite]] and [[Telstar]] projects, he gave a talk upon the subject in 1954 (published in 1955), using ideas that were "in the air", but was not aware of Clarke's article at the time.<ref>{{cite web |last= Pierce |first= John R. |authorlink= John R.

Though different from Clarke's idea of telecom relay, the idea of communicating with satellites in geostationary orbit itself had been described earlier. For example, the concept of geostationary satellites was described in [[Hermann Oberth]]'s 1923 book ''Die Rakete zu den Planetenräumen'' (''The Rocket into Interplanetary Space'') and then the idea of radio communication with those satellites in [[Herman Potočnik]]'s (written under the pseudonym Hermann Noordung) 1928 book ''Das Problem der Befahrung des Weltraums&nbsp;– der Raketen-Motor ([http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4026/contents.html The Problem of Space Travel&nbsp;—&nbsp;The Rocket Motor])'', sections: ''Providing for Long Distance Communications and Safety''{{efn|name=a}} and (possibly referring to the idea of relaying messages via satellite, but not that 3 would be optimal) ''Observing and Researching the Earth's Surface'' published in Berlin.<ref name="celestrak">{{cite web |url=http://celestrak.com/columns/v04n07/ |title=Basics of the Geostationary Orbit |accessdate=8 February 2007 |last=Kelso |first=Dr. T.

==Undersea explorer==
Clarke was an avid scuba diver and a member of the [[Underwater Explorers Club]]. In addition to writing, Clarke set up several diving-related ventures with his business partner Mike Wilson.  In 1956, while scuba diving, Wilson and Clarke uncovered ruined masonry, architecture and idol images of the sunken original Koneswaram temple – including carved columns with flower insignias, and stones in the form of elephant heads – spread on the shallow surrounding seabed.<ref name="reluctant">{{cite journal |last1= E Greig|first1=Doreen|year=1987 |title=The reluctant colonists: Netherlanders abroad in the 17th and 18th centuries |location= USA |publisher=Assen, The Netherlands ; Wolfeboro, NH, USA |issn=|oclc=14069213|page=227  |url= |quote= }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1=|year=1965 |title=Expedition in the waters of Ceylon |journal=[[Science Digest]] |location= Chicago |issn=0036-8296|oclc=1624458|volume=57 |page=142  |url=https://books.google.com/?id=i9QCAAAAIAAJ&q=konesar&dq=konesar&cd=14 |quote=One of the major achievements in Ceylon was the discovery of the ruins of the sunken Konesar Temple, which as located with the wrecked treasure ship&nbsp;...}}</ref> Other discoveries included [[Chola art|Chola bronzes]] from the original shrine, and these discoveries were described in Clarke's 1957 book ''The Reefs of Taprobane.''<ref name="reef">{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Arthur C. | title = The Reefs of Taprobane; Underwater Adventures around Ceylon| publisher = [[HarperCollins|Harper]] | year = 1957 | location = New York | isbn = 0-7434-4502-3}}</ref> In 1961, while filming off Great Basses Reef, Wilson found a [[Great Basses wreck|wreck]] and retrieved silver coins.

===On religion===
<!-- Please avoid adding quotations if the statement can be represented clearly in prose. This section could easily become overrun (see WP:QUOTEFARM). -->

===Paranormal phenomena===
Early in his career, Clarke had a fascination with the [[paranormal]] and stated that it was part of the inspiration for his novel ''Childhood's End''.

[[File:Thrilling wonder stories 195108.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of August 1951 ''Thrilling Wonder Stories'' in which Clarke story "Earthlight" first appears prior to his expanded novel. Future exploration of the unknown was encouraged by Clarke.]]
Clarke was well known for his television series investigating [[paranormal]] phenomena – ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World]]'' (1980), ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's World of Strange Powers]]'' (1985) and ''[[Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious Universe]]'' (1994) – enough to be parodied [[Big Foot (Goodies episode)|in an episode]] of ''[[The Goodies]]'' in which his show is cancelled after it is claimed he does not exist.

==Themes, style, and influences==
Clarke's work is marked by an optimistic view of science empowering mankind's exploration of the Solar System and the world's oceans. His images of the future often feature a [[Utopian]] setting with highly developed technology, ecology, and society, based on the author's ideals.<ref>Guy Riddihough, Review of ''The City and the Stars''&nbsp; in ''Science''&nbsp;,
(4 July 2008) Vol. 321. no. 5885, pp. 42 – 43 {{DOI|10.1126/science.1161705}}:
''What marks the book out are Clarke's sweeping vistas, grand ideas, and ultimately optimistic view of humankind's future in the cosmos.''</ref>
His early published stories usually featured the extrapolation of a technological innovation or scientific breakthrough into the underlying decadence of his own society.

A recurring theme in Clarke's works is the notion that the evolution of an intelligent species would eventually make them something close to gods. This was explored in his 1953 novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' and briefly touched upon in his novel ''[[Imperial Earth]]''. This idea of transcendence through evolution seems to have been influenced by [[Olaf Stapledon]], who wrote a number of books dealing with this theme. Clarke has said of Stapledon's 1930 book ''[[Last and First Men]]'' that "No other book had a greater influence on my life&nbsp;... [It] and its successor ''[[Star Maker]]'' (1937) are the twin summits of [Stapledon's] literary career".<ref name="testermanscifi">{{cite web |url=http://www.testermanscifi.org/ClarkeQuotesPart2.html |title=Arthur C.
