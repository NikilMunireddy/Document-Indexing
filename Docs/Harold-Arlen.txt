'''Harold Arlen''' (February 15, 1905&nbsp;– April 23, 1986) was an American [[composer]] of popular music, having written over 500 songs, a number of which have become known worldwide. In addition to composing the songs for the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (lyrics by [[Yip Harburg|E.Y. Harburg]]), including the classic "[[Over the Rainbow]]", Arlen is a highly regarded contributor to the [[Great American Songbook]]. "Over the Rainbow" was voted the twentieth century's No. 1 song by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haroldarlen.com/honors.html |title=Honors & Awards|publisher=Haroldarlen.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/07/365.songs/index.html |title=New song list puts 'Rainbow' way up high – CNN |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date=2001-03-07 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref>

==Life and career==
Arlen was born '''Hyman Arluck''', in [[Buffalo, New York]], United States, the child of a Jewish [[hazzan|cantor]]. His twin brother died the next day. He learned the [[piano]] as a youth and formed a band as a young man. He achieved some local success as a pianist and singer and moved to [[New York City]] in his early 20s. He worked as an accompanist in vaudeville.<ref>Laurie, Joe, Jr. ''Vaudeville: From the Honky-tonks to the Palace''. New York: Henry Holt, 1953. p. 328.</ref> At this point, he changed his name to Harold Arlen.  Between 1926 and about 1934, Arlen appeared occasionally as a band vocalist on records by [[The Buffalodians]], [[Red Nichols]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Leo Reisman]] and [[Eddie Duchin]], usually singing his own compositions.

In 1929, Arlen composed his first well-known song: "[[Get Happy (song)|Get Happy]]" (with lyrics by [[Ted Koehler]]). Throughout the early and mid-1930s, Arlen and Koehler wrote shows for the [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Cotton Club]], a popular [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]] night club, as well as for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theater|musicals]] and [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] [[musical film|films]]. Arlen and Koehler's partnership resulted in a number of hit songs, including the familiar standards "[[Let's Fall in Love]]" and "[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]]".  Arlen continued to perform as a pianist and vocalist with some success, most notably on records with [[Leo Reisman]]'s society dance orchestra.

Arlen's compositions have always been popular with [[jazz]] musicians because of his facility at incorporating a [[blues]] feeling into the idiom of the conventional American popular song.

In the mid-1930s, Arlen married, and spent increasing time in California, writing for movie musicals. It was at this time that he began working with lyricist [[E.Y. "Yip" Harburg]]. In 1938, the team was hired by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to compose songs for ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. The most famous of these is the song "[[Over the Rainbow]]" for which they won the [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award for Best Music, Original Song]]. They also wrote "[[Down with Love (song)|Down with Love]]" (featured in the 1937 Broadway show ''[[Hooray for What!]]''), "[[Lydia the Tattooed Lady]]" for Groucho Marx in ''[[At the Circus]]'' in 1939, and "[[Happiness is a Thing Called Joe]]" for [[Ethel Waters]] in the 1943 movie ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]].''

Arlen was a longtime friend and former roommate of actor [[Ray Bolger]], who starred in ''The Wizard of Oz''.

In the 1940s, he teamed up with lyricist [[Johnny Mercer]], and continued to write hit songs like "[[Blues in the Night]]", "[[Out of This World (Johnny Mercer song)|Out of this World]]", "[[That Old Black Magic]]", "[[Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive]]", "[[Any Place I Hang My Hat Is Home]]", "[[Come Rain or Come Shine]]" and "[[One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)]]".

Arlen composed two defining tunes which bookend [[Judy Garland]]'s musical persona: as a yearning, innocent girl in "Over the Rainbow" and a world-weary, "chic chanteuse" with "[[The Man That Got Away]]", the latter written for the 1954 version of the film ''[[A Star Is Born (1954 film)|A Star Is Born]]''.
