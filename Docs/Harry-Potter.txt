'''''Harry Potter''''' is a series of [[fantasy literature]] written by [[British people|British]] author [[J. K. Rowling]]. The novels chronicle the life of a young [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]], [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], and his friends [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ron Weasley]], all of whom are students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. The main [[story arc]] concerns Harry's struggle against [[Lord Voldemort]], the Dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow the Ministry of Magic, subjugate non-magic people and destroy anyone who stands in his way.

A play, ''[[Harry_Potter_and_the_Cursed_Child#Publication|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'', based on a story by Rowling, was written by Jack Thorne and John Tiffany and is set to premiere in 2016. Its script will subsequently be published as the eighth book in the series.

Since the release of the first novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', on 30 June 1997, the books have gained immense popularity, critical acclaim and commercial success worldwide. They attracted a wide adult audience, and have remained one of the preeminent cornerstones of young adult literature.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2996578.stm|title=Potter's place in the literary canon |publisher=BBC News|last=Allsobrook |first=Dr. Marian|date=18 June 2003|accessdate=15 October 2007}}</ref> The series has also had some share of criticism, including concern about the increasingly dark tone as the series progressed, as well as the often gruesome and graphic violence depicted in the series. {{As of|2013|07}}, the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide, making the series the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling book series in history]], and have been [[Harry Potter in translation|translated into seventy-three languages]].<ref name="Translations for Harry Potter" /><ref name=PotterStats20130731>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/31/because-its-his-birthday-harry-potter-by-the-numbers/|publisher=Time| title=Because It's His Birthday: Harry Potter, By the Numbers|author=TIME staff|date=31 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801013055/http://entertainment.time.com/2013/07/31/because-its-his-birthday-harry-potter-by-the-numbers/|archivedate=1 August 2013}}</ref> The last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment selling roughly eleven million copies in the United States within twenty four hours of its release.

A series of many [[genre]]s, including [[fantasy]], [[drama]], [[coming of age]] and the British [[school story]] (which includes elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]], [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], [[adventure novel|adventure]], [[Horror and terror|horror]] and [[romance novel|romance]]), it has many cultural meanings and references.<ref name="meanings" /> According to Rowling, the main [[theme (literature)|theme]] is death.<ref name="Geordie Greig">{{cite news|author=Greig |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/10/nrowl110.xml |title='There would be so much to tell her...' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=4 April 2007 |date=11 January 2006 |location=London |first=Geordie |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070311032026/http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/10/nrowl110.xml |archivedate=11 March 2007 }}</ref> There are also many other themes in the series, such as prejudice, corruption, and madness.<ref name=QuickQuoteQuill>{{cite news|url=http://www.quick-quote-quill.org/articles/2003/0302-newsround-mzimba.htm|publisher= Quick Quotes Quill| title=Interview with Steve Kloves and J.K.

The series was originally published in English by two major publishers, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] in the United Kingdom and [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Press]] in the United States. The play ''[[Harry Potter and the Cursed Child]]'' will open in London on 30 July 2016 at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] and its script will be published by [[Little, Brown Book Group|Little, Brown]] in the United Kingdom on 31 July 2016, who also published Rowling's adult novels and those written under her pen name Robert Galbraith.<ref>http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/10/new-harry-potter-cursed-child-eighth-book-july-play-script</ref> The seven books were adapted into an eight-part [[Harry Potter (film series)|film series]] by [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Pictures]], which is the second [[List of highest-grossing franchises and film series|highest-grossing film series]] of all time {{as of|2015|August|lc=y}}. The series also originated much [[tie-in]] merchandise, making the ''Harry Potter'' brand worth in excess of $15&nbsp;billion.<ref name="HP brand worth">{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/movers_and_shakers/article3663197.ece|title=Business big shot: Harry Potter author JK Rowling|accessdate=14 July 2009 | location=London | newspaper=The Times | first=Susan | last=Thompson | date=2 April 2008}}</ref>

Because of the success of the books and films, ''Harry Potter''-themed areas, known as ''[[The Wizarding World of Harry Potter]]'', have been created at several [[Universal Parks & Resorts]] theme parks around the world. The franchise continues to expand, with numerous supplemental books to accompany the films and the original novels, a studio tour in London that opened in 2012, a travelling exhibition that premièred in Chicago in 2009, a digital platform entitled [[Pottermore]], on which J.K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, a sequel in the form of a stage play, and a trilogy of spin-off films premièring in November 2016, amongst many other developments.

The novels revolve around [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]], an orphan who discovers at the age of eleven that he is a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]], though he lives in the ordinary world of non-magical people known as [[Muggles]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2000/books/reviews/07/14/review.potter.goblet/ |title=Review: Gladly drinking from Rowling's 'Goblet of Fire' |first=Kristin |last=Lemmerman |date=14 July 2000 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=28 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060629221627/http://edition.cnn.com:80/2000/books/reviews/07/14/review.potter.goblet/ |archivedate=29 June 2006 }}</ref> The wizarding world exists alongside the Muggle world, albeit hidden and in secrecy.

As Harry develops through his adolescence, he learns to overcome the problems that face him: magical, social and emotional, including ordinary teenage challenges such as friendships, infatuation, romantic relationships, schoolwork and exams, anxiety, depression, stress, and the greater test of preparing himself for the confrontation in the real world that lies ahead, in wizarding Britain's increasingly-violent second wizarding war.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.southflorida.com/movies/sfe-potter-synopses,0,6711375.story|title=Plot summaries for the first five Potter books|last=Hajela|first=Deepti|date=14 July 2005|publisher= SouthFlorida.com |archiveurl= http://www.ebookee.com/Harry-Potter-All-7-Novels-Deluxe-Editions_218867.html|archivedate=15 May 2010|accessdate=29 September 2008}}</ref>

The environment Rowling created is intimately connected to reality. The British magical community of the Harry Potter books is inspired by 1990s British culture, European folklore, classical mythology and [[alchemy]], incorporating objects and wildlife such as [[wand|magic wands]], magic plants, potions, and spells, flying [[broomstick]]s, [[centaur]]s and other magical creatures, the [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]], and the [[Philosopher's Stone]], beside others invented by Rowling. While the [[fantasy world|fantasy land]] of [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]] is an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative universe]] and the ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''{{'}} [[Middle-earth]] a mythic past, the wizarding world of ''Harry Potter'' exists in parallel within the real world and contains magical versions of the ordinary elements of everyday life, with the books being mostly set in Scotland (Hogwarts), the West Country, Devon, London and Surrey in south-east England.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/07/15/svharry15.xml&page=3|title=Harry Potter and the parallel universe|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=28 September 2008 | location=London | first=Nigel | last=Farndale | date=15 July 2007}}</ref> The world only accessible to wizards and magical beings comprises a fragmented collection of overlooked hidden streets, ancient pubs, lonely country manors and secluded castles invisible to the Muggle population.<ref name="muggle guide">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/820551.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=A Muggle's guide to Harry Potter|date=28 May 2004|accessdate=22 August 2008}}</ref>

=== Early years ===
When the first novel of the series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' (published in America and other countries as ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'') opens, it is apparent that some significant event has taken place in the wizarding world – an event so very remarkable, even the Muggles (non-magical people) notice signs of it. The full background to this event and Harry Potter's past is revealed gradually through the series. After the introductory chapter, the book leaps forward to a time shortly before Harry Potter's eleventh birthday, and it is at this point that his magical background begins to be revealed.

Harry's first contact with the wizarding world is through a half-giant, [[Rubeus Hagrid]], keeper of grounds and keys at Hogwarts. Hagrid reveals some of Harry's history.<ref name="hp-stories" /> Harry learns that, as a baby, he witnessed his parents' murder by the power-obsessed Dark wizard [[Lord Voldemort]], who subsequently attempted to kill him as well.<ref name="hp-stories">{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2007-07-19-potter-books_N.htm|title=The Harry Potter stories so far: A quick CliffsNotes review |work=USA Today|accessdate=28 September 2008 | first=Carol | last=Memmott | date=19 July 2007}}</ref> For reasons not revealed until the fifth book, the spell with which Voldemort tried to kill Harry rebounded. Harry survived with only a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead as a memento of the attack, and Voldemort disappeared afterwards. As its inadvertent saviour from Voldemort's reign of terror, Harry has become a living legend in the wizarding world. However, at the orders of the venerable and well-known wizard [[Albus Dumbledore]], the orphaned Harry had been placed in the home of his unpleasant [[Muggle]] relatives, the Dursleys, who kept him safe, but treated him poorly, having him live in a cupboard and do chores, rather than having their son Dudley, whom they spoiled, do anything. Petunia Dursley was jealous of her sister's magical abilities as a child at first, and, later, progressed onto simply believing that all wizards were freaks. Therefore, the Dursleys hated wizards, so they hid Harry's true heritage from him, saying his parents died in a car crash in hopes that he would grow up "normal".<ref name="hp-stories" />

With Hagrid's help, Harry prepares for and undertakes his first year of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the reader is introduced to many of the primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: [[Ron Weasley]], a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and [[Hermione Granger]], a gifted and very hardworking witch of non-magical parentage.<ref name="hp-stories" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80|title=J K Rowling at the Edinburgh Book Festival|date=15 August 2004|publisher=J.K. Rowling.com|accessdate=27 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823121201/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/news_view.cfm?id=80 <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=23 August 2008}}</ref> Harry also encounters the school's potions master, [[Severus Snape]], who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him, and the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Quirinus Quirrell]], who later turns out to be controlled by Lord Voldemort. The first book concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his quest for immortality, yearns to gain the power of the [[Sorcerer's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]], a substance that bestows everlasting life.<ref name="hp-stories" />

The series continues with ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', describing Harry's second year at Hogwarts. He and his friends investigate a 50-year-old mystery that appears uncannily related to recent sinister events at the school. Ron's younger sister, [[Ginny Weasley]], enrolls in her first year at Hogwarts, and finds an old notebook which turns out to be Voldemort's diary from his school days. Ginny becomes possessed by Voldemort through the diary and unconsciously opens the "Chamber of Secrets", unleashing an ancient monster, later revealed to be a basilisk, which begins attacking students at Hogwarts. The novel delves into the history of Hogwarts and a legend revolving around the Chamber that soon frightened everyone in the school. The book also introduces a new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], a highly cheerful, self-conceited wizard who goes around as if he is the most wonderful person who ever existed, who knows absolutely every single thing there is to know about everything, who later turns out to be a fraud. Harry discovers that prejudice exists in the wizarding world, and learns that Voldemort's reign of terror was often directed at wizards who were descended from Muggles. Harry also learns that his ability to speak the snake language [[Parseltongue]] is rare and often associated with the [[Black magic|Dark Arts]]. The novel ends after Harry saves Ginny's life by destroying the [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|basilisk]] and the enchanted diary which has been the source of the problems.

The third novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', follows Harry in his third year of magical education. It is the only book in the series which does not feature Lord Voldemort. Instead, Harry must deal with the knowledge that he has been targeted by [[Sirius Black]], his father's best friend, and, according to the Wizarding World, an escaped mass murderer who assisted in the deaths of Harry's parents. As Harry struggles with his reaction to the [[dementors]] – dark creatures with the power to devour a human soul, which feed on despair – which are ostensibly protecting the school, he reaches out to [[Remus Lupin]], a [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher who is eventually revealed to be a [[werewolf]]. Lupin teaches Harry defensive measures which are well above the level of magic generally executed by people his age. Harry came to know that both Lupin and Black were best friends of his father and that Black was framed by their fourth friend, [[Scabers|Peter Pettigrew]].<ref name="hp-plot-azkaban">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/05/books/rowling-azkaban.html?pagewanted=all|title=Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|last=Maguire|first=Gregory|date=5 September 1999|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008}}</ref> In this book, a recurring theme throughout the series is emphasised – in every book there is a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, none of whom lasts more than one school year.

=== Voldemort returns ===
[[File:The Elephant House.jpg|thumb|"[[The Elephant House (Edinburgh Café)|The Elephant House]]"&nbsp;– One of the cafés in [[Edinburgh]] where Rowling wrote the first part of ''Harry Potter''.|alt="The Elephant House", a small, painted red café where Rowling wrote a few chapters of ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''.]]

During Harry's fourth year of school (detailed in ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''), Harry is unwillingly entered as a participant in the Triwizard Tournament, a dangerous contest where three "champions", one from each participating school, must compete with each other in three tasks in order to win the triwizard cup. This year, Harry must compete against a witch and a wizard "champion" from visiting schools Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, as well as another Hogwarts student, causing Harry's friends to distance themselves from him.<ref name="hp-plot-goblet">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/23/books/rowling-goblet.html|title=Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|last=King|first=Stephen|authorlink=Stephen King|date=23 July 2000|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008}}</ref> Harry is guided through the tournament by their new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, [[Mad-Eye Moody|Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody]], who turns out to be an impostor – one of Voldemort's supporters named [[Barty Crouch, Jr]]. in disguise. The point at which the mystery is unravelled marks the series' shift from foreboding and uncertainty into open conflict. Voldemort's plan to have Crouch use the tournament to bring Harry to Voldemort succeeds. Although Harry manages to escape, [[Cedric Diggory]], the other Hogwarts champion in the tournament, is killed by Peter Pettigrew and Voldemort re-enters the wizarding world with a physical body.

In the fifth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Harry must confront the newly resurfaced Voldemort. In response to Voldemort's reappearance, Dumbledore re-activates the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], a secret society which works from Sirius Black's dark family home to defeat Voldemort's minions and protect Voldemort's targets, especially Harry. Despite Harry's description of Voldemort's recent activities, the [[Ministry of Magic]] and many others in the magical world refuse to believe that Voldemort has returned.<ref name="hp-phoenix-plot">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/13/books/review/rowling-phoenix.html?pagewanted=all |title='Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' |date=13 July 2003|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008 | first=John | last=Leonard}}</ref> In an attempt to counter and eventually discredit Dumbledore, who along with Harry is the most prominent voice in the wizarding world attempting to warn of Voldemort's return, the Ministry appoints [[Dolores Umbridge]] as the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts and the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. She transforms the school into a dictatorial regime and refuses to allow the students to learn ways to defend themselves against dark magic.<ref name="hp-phoenix-plot" />

With Ron and Hermione's suggestion, Harry forms "[[Dumbledore's Army]]", a secret study group aimed to teach his classmates the higher-level skills of Defence Against the Dark Arts that he has learned from his previous encounters with Dark wizards. An important prophecy concerning Harry and Lord Voldemort is revealed,<ref name="Ivory Tower 1">{{cite book|last=A Whited|first=Lana|title=The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter: Perspectives on a Literary Phenomenon | publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9|page=371}}</ref> and Harry discovers that he and Voldemort have a painful connection, allowing Harry to view some of Voldemort's actions telepathically. In the novel's climax, Harry and his friends face off against Voldemort's [[Death Eaters]] at the [[Ministry of Magic]]. Although the timely arrival of members of the Order of the Phoenix saves the children's lives, [[Sirius Black]] is killed in the conflict.

In the sixth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', Voldemort begins waging open warfare. Harry and his friends are relatively protected from that danger at Hogwarts. They are subject to all the difficulties of adolescence – Harry eventually begins dating Ginny, Ron establishes a strong infatuation with fellow Hogwarts student [[Lavender Brown]], and Hermione starts to develop romantic feelings toward Ron. Near the beginning of the novel, lacking his own book, Harry is given an old potions textbook filled with many annotations and recommendations signed by a mysterious writer; "the Half-Blood Prince." This book is a source of scholastic success and great recognition from their new potions master, [[Horace Slughorn]], but because of the potency of the spells that are written in it, becomes a source of concern. Harry takes private lessons with Dumbledore, who shows him various memories concerning the early life of Voldemort in a device called a [[Pensieve]]. These reveal that in order to preserve his life, Voldemort has split his soul into pieces, creating a series of [[horcrux]]es – evil enchanted items hidden in various locations, one of which was the diary destroyed in the second book.<ref name="harry-potter-prince">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/16/books/16choc.html?pagewanted=all |title= Harry Potter Works His Magic Again in a Far Darker Tale |last=Kakutani|first=Michiko |date=16 July 2005 |newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=28 September 2008}}</ref> Harry's snobbish adversary, Draco Malfoy, attempts to attack Dumbledore, and the book culminates in the killing of Dumbledore by [[Professor Snape]], the titular Half-Blood Prince.

''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', the last book in the series, begins directly after the events of the sixth book. Lord Voldemort has completed his ascension to power and gained control of the Ministry of Magic. Harry, Ron and Hermione drop out of school so that they can find and destroy Voldemort's remaining horcruxes. To ensure their own safety as well as that of their family and friends, they are forced to isolate themselves. As they search for the horcruxes, the trio learns details about Dumbledore's past, as well as Snape's true motives – he had worked on Dumbledore's behalf since the murder of Harry's mother. Snape is killed by Voldemort out of paranoia.

The book culminates in the Battle of Hogwarts. Harry, Ron and Hermione, in conjunction with members of the Order of the Phoenix and many of the teachers and students, defend Hogwarts from Voldemort, his Death Eaters, and various dangerous [[Magical creatures (Harry Potter)|magical creatures]]. Several major characters are killed in the first wave of the battle, including [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Fred Weasley]]. After learning that he himself is a horcrux, Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, who casts a killing curse (Avada Kedavra) at him. The defenders of Hogwarts do not surrender after learning of Harry's presumed death and continue to fight on. Harry awakens and faces Voldemort, whose horcruxes have all been destroyed. In the final battle, Voldemort's killing curse rebounds off Harry's defensive spell (Expelliarmus) killing Voldemort. Also, as most viewers saw coming, Harry Potter marries and has children with Ginny [[Weasley]] and Hermione Granger marries and has children with Ronald Weasley.

An epilogue describes the lives of the surviving characters and the effects of Voldemort's death on the wizarding world. It also introduces the children of all the characters.

== Structure and genre ==

The ''Harry Potter'' novels are mainly directed at a young adult audience as opposed to an audience of middle grade readers, children, or adults. The novels fall within the genre of [[fantasy literature]], and qualify as a unique type of fantasy called "urban fantasy", "contemporary fantasy", or "low fantasy". They are mainly dramas, and maintain a fairly serious and dark tone throughout, though they do contain some notable instances of [[tragicomedy]] and black humour. In many respects, they are also examples of the ''[[bildungsroman]]'', or [[coming of age]] novel,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0OON/is_1_24/ai_107896944/ |title=Wizards and wainscots: generic structures and genre themes in the Harry Potter series|last=Anne Le Lievre|first= Kerrie |year=2003|publisher=CNET Networks |accessdate=1 September 2008}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and contain elements of [[mystery (fiction)|mystery]], adventure, [[horror fiction|horror]], [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], and [[romance novel|romance]]. They can be considered part of the British children's [[School story|boarding school genre]], which includes [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[Stalky & Co.]], [[Enid Blyton]]'s ''[[Malory Towers]]'', ''[[St. Clare's series|St. Clare's]]'' and the ''[[Naughtiest Girl]]'' series, and [[Charles Hamilton (writer)|Frank Richards's]] ''[[Billy Bunter]]'' novels: the ''Harry Potter'' books are predominantly set in [[Hogwarts]], a fictional British boarding school for wizards, where the curriculum includes the use of [[magic (Harry Potter)|magic]].<ref name="Harry Potter Boarding">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/563232.stm|title=Harry Potter makes boarding fashionable |publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 September 2008 | date=13 December 1999}}</ref> In this sense they are "in a direct line of descent from [[Thomas Hughes]]'s ''[[Tom Brown's School Days]]'' and other Victorian and Edwardian novels of [[Public school (UK)|British public school]] life", though they are, as many note, more contemporary, grittier, darker, and more mature than the typical boarding school novel, addressing serious themes of death, love, loss, prejudice, coming-of-age, and the loss of innocence in a 1990's British setting.<ref>{{cite book|last= Ellen Jones | first = Leslie| title = JRR Tolkien: A Biography | publisher=Greenwood Press|year= 2003 | accessdate=9 September 2005|isbn=978-0-313-32340-9|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last= A Whited | first = Lana | title=The Ivory Tower and Harry Potter: Perspectives on a Literary Phenomenon | publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0-8262-1549-9|page=28}}</ref>

The books are also, in the words of [[Stephen King]], "shrewd mystery tales",<ref name="Wild About Harry">{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/23/reviews/000723.23kinglt.html | newspaper= The New York Times | title = Wild About Harry | date = 23 July 2000 | first = Stephen | last = King | authorlink = Stephen King | accessdate =9 August 2010 | quote = ...the Harry Potter books are, at heart, satisfyingly shrewd mystery tales.}}</ref> and each book is constructed in the manner of a [[Sherlock Holmes]]-style [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] adventure. The stories are told from a [[third person limited]] point of view with very few exceptions (such as the opening chapters of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]]'' and the first two chapters of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]'').

In the middle of each book, Harry struggles with the problems he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. If students are caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. However, the stories reach their climax in the [[summer term]], near or just after [[Final examination|final exams]], when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either [[Voldemort]] or one of his followers, the [[Death Eaters]], with the stakes a matter of life and death–a point underlined, as the series progresses, by one or more characters being killed in each of the final four books.<ref name="Harry Potter Last Adventure" /><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/06/26/rowling-potter-deaths.html | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060630023326/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/06/26/rowling-potter-deaths.html | archivedate=12 May 2010|title=Two characters to die in last 'Harry Potter' book: J.K. Rowling|publisher=CBC|accessdate=1 September 2008 | date=26 June 2006}}</ref> In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and [[mentor]] [[Albus Dumbledore]]. In the final novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the ''[[dénouement]]''.<ref name="Harry Potter Last Adventure">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1637886_1637891,00.html|title=Harry Potter's Last Adventure | last=Grossman|first=Lev|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=1 September 2008 | date=28 June 2007}}</ref>

== Themes ==
According to Rowling, a major theme in the series is death: "My books are largely about death. They open with the death of Harry's parents. There is Voldemort's obsession with conquering death and his quest for [[immortality]] at any price, the goal of anyone with magic. I so understand why Voldemort wants to conquer death. We're all frightened of it."<ref name="Geordie Greig" />

Academics and journalists have developed many other interpretations of themes in the books, some more complex than others, and some including [[politics of Harry Potter|political subtexts]]. Themes such as [[Normality (behavior)|normality]], oppression, survival, and overcoming imposing odds have all been considered as prevalent throughout the series.<ref name="Greenwald2005">{{cite journal|last=Greenwald|first=Janey|title=Understanding Harry Potter: Parallels to the Deaf World|journal=The Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|volume=10|issue=4|pages=442–450|date=Fall 2005|doi=10.1093/deafed/eni041|pmid=16000691|last2=Greenwald|first2=J |url=http://jdsde.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=16000691|format=Free full text}}</ref> Similarly, the theme of making one's way through adolescence and "going over one's most harrowing ordeals – and thus coming to terms with them" has also been considered.<ref name="Duffy2002">{{cite journal|last=Duffy|first=Edward|title=Sentences in Harry Potter, Students in Future Writing Classes|journal=Rhetoric Review|volume=21|issue=2|year=2002|page=177|doi=10.1207/S15327981RR2102_03}}</ref> Rowling has stated that the books comprise "a prolonged argument for tolerance, a prolonged plea for an end to [[bigotry]]" and that they also pass on a message to "question authority and... not assume that the establishment or the press tells you all of the truth".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7053982.stm|title=JK Rowling outs Dumbledore as gay|accessdate=21 October 2007|date=21 October 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref>

While the books could be said to comprise many other themes, such as power/abuse of power, violence and hatred, love, loss, prejudice, and free choice, they are, as Rowling states, "deeply entrenched in the whole plot"; the writer prefers to let themes "grow organically", rather than sitting down and consciously attempting to impart such ideas to her readers.<ref name=QuickQuoteQuill /> Along the same lines is the ever-present theme of adolescence, in whose depiction Rowling has been purposeful in acknowledging her characters' sexualities and not leaving Harry, as she put it, "stuck in a state of permanent pre-pubescence". Rowling has also been praised for her nuanced depiction of the ways in which death and violence affects youth, and humanity as a whole.<ref name="Favourite chapter">{{cite news

Rowling said that, to her, the moral significance of the tales seems "blindingly obvious". The key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy, "because that … is how tyranny is started, with people being [[apathetic]] and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-vancouversun-wyman.htm|first=Wyman|last=Max|title="You can lead a fool to a book but you cannot make them think": Author has frank words for the religious right|publisher=The Vancouver Sun (British Columbia)|date=26 October 2000 |accessdate=28 July 2008}}</ref>

== Origins ==
{{Main|Harry Potter influences and analogues}}
In 1990, Rowling was on a crowded train from [[Manchester]] to London when the idea for Harry suddenly "fell into her head". Rowling gives an account of the experience on her website saying:<ref name="Harry falls into author's head">{{cite web|publisher=JKRowling.com|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm|title=Biography|first= JK |last = Rowling |accessdate=21 May 2006|year=2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421032312/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/biography.cfm <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=21 April 2006}}</ref>

{{quote|"I had been writing almost continuously since the age of six but I had never been so excited about an idea before. I simply sat and thought, for four (delayed train) hours, and all the details bubbled up in my brain, and this scrawny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who did not know he was a wizard became more and more real to me."}}

Rowling completed ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' in 1995 and the [[manuscript]] was sent off to several prospective [[literary agent|agents]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.eitb24.com/new/en/B24_57676/entertainment/FACTBOX-Final-Harry-Potter-book-set-for-release/|title=Final Harry Potter book set for release|date=15 July 2007|publisher=[[Euskal Telebista]]|accessdate=21 August 2008}}</ref> The second agent she tried, Christopher Little, offered to represent her and sent the manuscript to Bloomsbury.

Rowling (Joanne Kathleen Rowling), using her grandmother's name as her second name because she has no [[middle name]].<ref name="Ivory Tower 2" /><ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1349288/Harry-Potter-and-the-mystery-of-J-Ks-lost-initial.html|title=Harry Potter and the mystery of J K's lost initial|last=Savill|first=Richard|date=21 June 2001|work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=27 September 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

Some of the translators hired to work on the books were well-known authors before their work on ''Harry Potter'', such as [[Viktor Golyshev]], who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] translation of books two to seven was undertaken by [[Sevin Okyay]], a popular literary critic and cultural commentator.<ref>{{cite web|title=Not lost in translation: Harry Potter in Turkish |last=Güler |first=Emrah |url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=29054|year=2005|work=The Turkish Daily News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930171135/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=29054|archivedate=15 May 2010|accessdate =9 May 2007}}</ref> For reasons of secrecy, translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available. This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/world/newsid_3036000/3036350.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=OOTP is best seller in France&nbsp;– in English!|date=1 July 2003|accessdate=28 July 2008}}</ref>

=== Completion of the series ===
In December 2005, Rowling stated on her web site, "2006 will be the year when I write the final book in the ''Harry Potter'' series."<ref>{{cite web| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230024256/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/| url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/| title=J.K.Rowling Official Site.

The book itself was finished on 11 January 2007 in the [[Balmoral Hotel]], Edinburgh, where she scrawled a message on the back of a bust of [[Hermes]]. It read: "J. K. Rowling finished writing ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'' in this room (552) on 11 January 2007."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6324289.stm|title=Potter author signs off in style|publisher=BBC News|date=2 February 2007 | accessdate=5 January 2010}}</ref>

Rowling herself has stated that the last chapter of the final book (in fact, the epilogue) was completed "in something like 1990".<ref name="last chapter">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5119836.stm|title=Rowling to kill two in final book|publisher=BBC News|date=27 June 2006|accessdate=25 July 2007}}</ref><ref name="last chapter means epilogue">{{cite news|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1201-bbc-hpandme.htm|title=Harry Potter and Me|date=28 December 2001|accessdate=12 September 2007|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> In June 2006, Rowling, on an appearance on the British talk show ''[[Richard & Judy]]'', announced that the chapter had been modified as one character "got a reprieve" and two others who previously survived the story had in fact been killed. On 28 March 2007, the cover art for the Bloomsbury Adult and Child versions and the Scholastic version were released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/default.aspx?sec=2&sec2=1&sec3=7 |title=Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows at Bloomsbury Publishing |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |accessdate=28 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810092541/http://harrypotter.bloomsbury.com/?sec=2&sec2=1&sec3=7/ |archivedate= 2014-08-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/covers/art7.htm|title=Cover Art: Harry Potter 7|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419030755/http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/covers/art7.htm|archivedate=12 May 2010|publisher=Scholastic|accessdate=28 September 2008}}</ref>

In September 2012, Rowling mentioned in an interview that she might go back to make a "director's cut" of two of the existing ''Harry Potter'' books.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19711553 |title=JK Rowling mulls 'director's cut' of Harry Potter books |accessdate=9 September 2013 |date=26 September 2012 |work=BBC News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530090605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19711553 |archivedate=2015-05-30}}</ref>

=== Cover art ===
For cover art, Bloomsbury chose painted art in a classic style of design, with the first cover a watercolour and pencil drawing by illustrator [[Thomas Taylor (artist)|Thomas Taylor]] showing Harry boarding the Hogwarts Express, and a title in the font [[Cochin (typeface)|Cochin Bold]].<ref name="Me and Harry Potter">{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Thomas|title=Me and Harry Potter|url=http://www.thomastaylor-author.com/me-and-harry-potter/|website=Thomas Taylor (author site)|accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref> The first releases of the successive books in the series followed in the same style but somewhat more realistic, illustrating scenes from the books. These covers were created by first [[Cliff Wright]] and then Jason Cockroft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/20/books.booksnews|title=Harry Potter beats Austen in sale rooms|last=Thorpe|first=Vanessa|date=20 January 2002|work=The Observer|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=21 November 2010}}</ref>

Due to the appeal of the books among an adult audience, Bloomsbury commissioned a second line of editions in an 'adult' style. These initially used black-and-white photographic art for the covers showing objects from the books (including a very American Hogwarts Express) without depicting people, but later shifted to partial colourisation with a picture of Slytherin's locket on the cover of the final book.

International and later editions have been created by a range of designers, including [[Mary GrandPré]] for U.S. audiences and [[Mika Launis]] in Finland.<ref>[[Rowling, J.K.]] ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''; American edition; [[Arthur A.

=== Cultural impact ===
{{details|Harry Potter fandom}}
Fans of the series were so eager for the latest instalment that bookstores around the world began holding events to coincide with the midnight release of the books, beginning with the 2000 publication of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''. The events, commonly featuring mock sorting, games, face painting, and other live entertainment have achieved popularity with Potter fans and have been highly successful in attracting fans and selling books with nearly nine million of the 10.8 million initial print copies of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' sold in the first 24 hours.<ref name="Harry Potter casts spell at checkouts">{{cite news

Some lessons identified in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different than those who had not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although we cannot know if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, there is a clear correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hanna Kozlowska |title = Can 'Harry Potter' Change the World? |url = http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/can-harry-potter-change-the-world/?_r=0 |newspaper = The New York Times |accessdate = 2016-04-13}}</ref>

The great demand for Harry Potter books motivated the ''New York Times'' to create a separate best-seller list for children's literature in 2000, just before the release of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''. By 24 June 2000, Rowling's novels had been on the list for 79 straight weeks; the first three novels were each on the hardcover best-seller list.<ref name="NYT_2000/06/24">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/24/books/the-times-plans-a-children-s-best-seller-list.html |title=The Times Plans a Children's Best-Seller List |last=Smith|first=Dinitia|date=24 June 2000|work=The New York Times|accessdate=30 September 2008}}</ref> On 12 April 2007, [[Barnes & Noble]] declared that ''Deathly Hallows'' had broken its [[pre-order]] record, with more than 500,000 copies pre-ordered through its site.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0413/potterh.html|title=New Harry Potter breaks pre-order record|date=13 April 2007|publisher=RTÉ.ie Entertainment|accessdate =23 April 2007}}</ref> For the release of ''Goblet of Fire'', 9,000 [[FedEx]] trucks were used with no other purpose than to deliver the book.<ref name=ew-gof-midnight>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,276735_2,00.html|title=Wild About Harry|date=31 August 2005|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=4 March 2007|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Fierman|first=Daniel|quote=When I buy the books for my grandchildren, I have them all gift wrapped but one...that's for me.

== Reception ==

=== Literary criticism ===
Early in its history, ''Harry Potter'' received positive reviews. On publication, the first book, ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', attracted attention from the Scottish newspapers, such as ''[[The Scotsman]]'', which said it had "all the makings of a classic",<ref name="newspaper-reviews-hp-ps">{{cite book|last=Eccleshare|first=Julia|title=A Guide to the Harry Potter Novels|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8264-5317-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cHjF5K2uVdsC&pg=PA10&dq=the+most+imaginative+debut+since+Roald+Dahl|page=10}}</ref> and ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Glasgow Herald]]'', which called it "Magic stuff".<ref name="newspaper-reviews-hp-ps" /> Soon the English newspapers joined in, with more than one comparing it to [[Roald Dahl]]'s work: ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' rated it as "the most imaginative debut since [[Roald Dahl]]",<ref name="newspaper-reviews-hp-ps" /> a view echoed by ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' ("comparisons to Dahl are, this time, justified"),<ref name="newspaper-reviews-hp-ps" /> while ''[[The Guardian]]'' called it "a richly textured novel given lift-off by an inventive wit".<ref name="newspaper-reviews-hp-ps" />

By the time of the release of the fifth book , ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,'' the books began to receive strong criticism from a number of literary scholars. Yale professor, literary scholar, and critic [[Harold Bloom]] raised criticisms of the books' literary merits, saying, "Rowling's mind is so governed by clichés and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing."<ref>{{cite news|work=The Boston Globe|date=24 September 2003|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/|title=Dumbing down American readers|first=Harold|last=Bloom|accessdate =20 June 2006}}</ref> [[A. S. Byatt]] authored a ''New York Times'' op-ed article calling Rowling's universe a "secondary secondary world, made up of intelligently patchworked derivative motifs from all sorts of children's literature&nbsp;... written for people whose imaginative lives are confined to TV cartoons, and the exaggerated (more exciting, not threatening) mirror-worlds of soaps, reality TV and celebrity gossip".<ref name="Harry Potter and the Childish Adult">{{cite news|work=The New York Times|title=Harry Potter and the Childish Adult|date=7 July 2003|accessdate=1 August 2008|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/07/opinion/harry-potter-and-the-childish-adult.html |first=A.

Taylor stressed the progressively darker tone of the books, shown by the murder of a classmate and close friend and the psychological wounds and [[social isolation]] each causes. Taylor also argued that ''Philosopher's Stone'', said to be the most light-hearted of the seven published books, disrupts the childhood reassurances that Byatt claims spur the series' success: the book opens with news of a [[double murder]], for example.<ref name="A.S.

[[Stephen King]] called the series "a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable", and declared "Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor" to be "remarkable". However, he wrote that despite the story being "a good one", he is "a little tired of discovering Harry at home with his horrible aunt and uncle", the formulaic beginning of all seven books.<ref name="Wild About Harry" /> King has also joked that "Rowling's never met an adverb she did not like!" He does however predict that Harry Potter "will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]], [[Huckleberry Finn|Huck]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages".<ref>{{cite news|work=The Guardian | url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/31/harrypotter.jkjoannekathleenrowling| title=JK Rowling: The mistress of all she surveys| first= Killian| last=Fox|date=31 December 2006|accessdate =10 February 2007 | location=London}}</ref>

=== Social impact ===

''[[Washington Post]]'' book critic Ron Charles opined in July 2007 that the large numbers of adults reading the ''Potter'' series but few other books may represent a "bad case of cultural infantilism", and that the straightforward "good vs. evil" theme of the series is "childish". He also argued "through no fault of Rowling's", the cultural and marketing "hysteria" marked by the publication of the later books "trains children and adults to expect the roar of the coliseum, a mass-media experience that no other novel can possibly provide".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/13/AR2007071301730_pf.html| title=Harry Potter and the Death of Reading |date=15 July 2007| last= Charles|first=Ron | accessdate=16 April 2008 | newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

Jenny Sawyer wrote in ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' on 25 July 2007 that the books represent a "disturbing trend in commercial storytelling and Western society" in that stories "moral center [sic] have all but vanished from much of today's [[Popular culture|pop culture]]&nbsp;... after 10 years, 4,195 pages, and over 375 million copies, J. K. Rowling's towering achievement lacks the cornerstone of almost all great children's literature: the hero's moral journey". Harry Potter, Sawyer argues, neither faces a "moral struggle" nor undergoes any ethical growth, and is thus "no guide in circumstances in which right and wrong are anything less than black and white".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0725/p09s02-coop.html| title=Missing from 'Harry Potter"&nbsp;– a real moral struggle | author= Sawyer, Jenny | accessdate=16 April 2008 |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=25 July 2007}}</ref> In contrast Emily Griesinger described Harry's first passage through to [[Platform 9¾]] as an application of faith and hope, and his encounter with the Sorting Hat as the first of many in which Harry is shaped by the choices he makes.

In an 8 November 2002 ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' article, Chris Suellentrop likened Potter to a "trust-fund kid whose success at school is largely attributable to the gifts his friends and relatives lavish upon him". Noting that in Rowling's fiction, magical ability potential is "something you are born to, not something you can achieve", Suellentrop wrote that Dumbledore's maxim that "It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities" is hypocritical, as "the school that Dumbledore runs values native gifts above all else".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/?id=2073627| title=Harry Potter: Fraud | author= Suellentrop, Chris

The books have been the subject of a number of [[Lawsuit|legal proceedings]], stemming from various conflicts over copyright and trademark infringements. The popularity and high [[market value]] of the series has led Rowling, her publishers, and film distributor [[Warner Bros.]] to take legal measures to protect their copyright, which have included banning the sale of ''Harry Potter'' imitations, targeting the owners of websites over the "Harry Potter" [[domain name]], and suing author [[Nancy Stouffer]] to counter her accusations that Rowling had plagiarised her work.<ref>{{cite web|title=SScholastic Inc, J.K.

The books also aroused controversies in the literary and publishing worlds.

The story and design of the games follows the selected film's characterisation and plot; EA worked closely with Warner Brothers to include scenes from the films. The last game in the series, ''Deathly Hallows'', was split with ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (video game)|Part 1]]'' released in November 2010 and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (video game)|Part 2]]'' debuting on consoles in July 2011.

=== United Kingdom ===
In March 2011, Warner Bros. announced plans to build a tourist attraction in the United Kingdom to showcase the ''Harry Potter'' film series. Warner Bros. Studio Tour London is a behind-the-scenes walking tour featuring authentic sets, costumes and props from the film series. The attraction is located at [[Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden]], where all eight of the ''Harry Potter'' films were made. Warner Bros. constructed two new sound stages to house and showcase the famous sets from each of the British-made productions, following a £100 million investment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-12645416|title=Harry Potter tour to open at Leavesden studios in 2012|accessdate=18 May 2011 |publisher=BBC News|date=5 March 2011}}</ref> It opened to the public in March 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-16257334 |title=Harry Potter tour at Leavesden Studios reveals new sets |accessdate=16 February 2012 |publisher=BBC News|date=19 December 2011}}</ref>
