'''Clyde Football Club''' are a Scottish professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Cumbernauld]], who play in  [[Scottish League Two]]. Formed in 1877 at the [[River Clyde]], the team  play their home games at [[Broadwood Stadium]], and are  managed by former Scotland international [[Barry Ferguson]].

==History==

===1877–1898===

The Clyde Football Club was founded and played on the banks of the [[River Clyde]] at Barrowfield. Documentary evidence from the SFA and indeed match reports in the [[Glasgow]] press clearly show it all began in 1877, and the thread continues unbroken to this day.

Here's how the [[Scottish Football Association|SFA]] recorded Clyde's origins:

{{Quotation|"Clyde:- Founded 1877; Membership 50; Grounds (private), Barrowfield Park, on the banks of the Clyde; ten minutes walk from Bridgeton Cross; Club House on grounds; Colours, White & Blue. Hon. Secretary, John D. Graham, 24 Monteith Row."}}

Sitting on the edge of [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]], Barrowfield Park lay in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the river Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile works with a high population density to provide the labour. Although no stadium photographs have emerged it appears the ground consisted of a grand stand running north-south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch.

Today this area is dotted with industrial units, but also contains a large grassed area. So it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Barrowfield was originally shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.

The club founded then has no resemblance to a modern professional football club. Clyde F.C. were a private members club more akin to a present-day golf or bowling club. Clyde's Secretary, John Graham, was also a noted rower and it seems the club had other sporting and cultural activities besides football.

The first mention of Clyde was in Monday's [[Evening Times]] of 17 September 1877:

{{Quotation|"Clyde v T. Lanark
Clyde opened their season at Barrowfield with a match against the 3rd Lanark Volunteers. In the end the 3rd were victors by 3 goals to 1."}}

This very short report was common at the time as sport was of little significance and football competed with racing, bowling and quoiting for the limited column space available.

Although most fixtures were informal, the [[Scottish Cup]] had existed since 1873. Soon there would also be the Glasgow Merchants' & Charity Cup and the [[Glasgow Cup]] that in their time were hotly contested major competitions. Clyde entered the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup on 29 September 1877 along with one hundred and one other teams. [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] were the visitors once again and they triumphed 1–0.

Clyde joined the [[Scottish Football League]] in 1891. Following acceptance, [[Vale of Leven F.C.|Vale of Leven]] provided the opposition for Clyde's first League fixture on Saturday, 15 August 1891. In a dream introduction to League football Clyde triumphed 10–3, a mid-table finish saw Clyde complete a confident season in League football.

With League football an undoubted success, Barrowfield revealed its limitations and simply could not cope with the crowds as many gained illegal entry. Opposition teams complained about the facilities and it was clear that Clyde would have to do something to appease the League.

The solution lay directly across the Clyde on some open ground known as [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]]. Clyde endured a [[1899–1900 in Scottish football|terrible final season]] at Barrowfield finishing bottom of Division 1. The final action at Barrowfield was a friendly against crack opposition in the form of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 30 April 1898 ending in a 3–3 draw. At a stroke Clyde transformed from Brigtonians to Shawfielders.

===1899–1919===

Clyde said farewell to Barrowfield in the spring of 1898. Across the river lay an area of undeveloped land known as Shawfield. With a new League season only a matter of months away, Clyde had the monumental task of transforming and enclosing the area into a venue suitable for first-class football. The move was largely financed by Clyde becoming incorporated and issuing shares in "The Clyde Football Club Limited".

[[File:ClydeFC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|Chart of historic table positions of Clyde in the League.]]By the eve of the new season, Clyde F.C. Ltd had an enclosed area of about {{convert|9|acre|ha}}. A grand stand seating 1500 was nearing completion and embankment works around the pitch were well under way. The Clyde directors of the time wildly estimated a final capacity of 100,000.

[[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], the neighbours from up the road, were the inaugural opposition at [[Shawfield Stadium]] on 27 August 1898. A healthy crowd of 10,000 turned up to see a goalless draw and return gate receipts of £203.

Matters took a turn for the better in the [[1903–04 in Scottish football|1903–04 season]]. Clyde finished 2nd in Division Two but were not elected to Division One (automatic promotion/relegation did not appear until 1921). Clyde also won a supplementary competition called the [[Glasgow and West of Scotland Football League|Glasgow & West of Scotland League]] the following season. Promotion was again denied in [[1904–05 in Scottish football|season 1904–05]], with Clyde the Division Two champions, but promotion was finally earned the [[1905–06 in Scottish football|following season]]. The years up to World War I would be far more successful and probably represent the most consistent period of success for the club.

A 3rd place in Division One in [[1908–09 in Scottish football|season 1908–09]], only three points behind champions, Celtic, put Clyde firmly on the map of Scottish football. The semi-final of the [[Scottish Cup]] was also reached for the first time only to be thwarted by Celtic after a replay. International honours were also awarded to Clyde players for the first time this season. William 'Shoogly' Walker represented [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] against [[Ireland national football team (1882–1950)|Ireland]] at [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] (5–0), while the opposition included his team-mate, [[Jack Kirwan]].

For five seasons until war began, Clyde were at the top end of Division One and reached the [[Scottish Cup]] final in 1910 and 1912. The former of these finals was especially disappointing. For eighty-three minutes Clyde (McTurk; Watson & Blair; Walker, McAteer & Robertson; Stirling & MacCartney; Chalmers; Jackson & Booth) held a 2–0 lead with goals from Chalmers and Booth, and looked certain to win. With the Cup in sight, nerves got the better of Clyde and Robertson fluffed a clearance off Blair and into his own net. Dogged [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] fought all the way and salvaged the game in the last minute with an equaliser from Langlands. The replay was far more cagey an affair and ended goalless after [[extra time]] but with Dundee looking physically stronger. The third game was again a tight affair with Clyde scoring after only three minutes through Chalmers. Dundee equalised before the interval and with Clyde's energy sapped, John "Sailor" Hunter blasted Dundee to victory.

The 1912 final saw [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] trump the Bully Wee once again with a 2–0 victory. Another third-place finish in the League being the only consolation. Still undaunted, Clyde reached the semi-final again in 1912–13, but the jinx struck again and after a replay [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] squeezed into the final.

Clyde had something to cheer about during this period of near misses as they clinched the Glasgow & Merchants' Charity Cup in 1910 and the [[Glasgow Cup]] in 1915. It is easy to deride these competitions as second rate but they were fought just as hard as the Scottish Cup and indeed all six competitors (Celtic, Clyde, [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]]) were more often than not resident in Division One.

A severe blow was dealt as fire destroyed the grand stand in September 1914, and with it much of the club's early history. Officials, players and fans had little time to dwell upon the calamity as war began in November. The Scottish League took the decision to continue playing even though there was strong moral pressure on every young man to sign up for 'King & Country'. Besides, football crowds provided a fertile recruitment ground and the games themselves kept morale high. Many players joined up and teams, like Clyde, found it increasingly difficult to field competitive sides and the League eventually reduced back to a single division. Many Clyde players signed up and some unfortunately never returned such as C. Clunas (2nd Royal Fusiliers), T. Cranston (Black Watch) and W. Sharp (1st Battalion Royal Scots).

===1920–1945===

Clyde managed to sustain football through the difficult war years and peacetime presented new challenges. The Scottish League continued through [[1919–20 in Scottish football|1919–21]] with only one division. Division Two was restarted in [[1921–22 in Scottish football|1921–22]] with a very crucial difference. Automatic promotion and relegation had been adopted and while the benefits were obvious for ambitious teams, the financial penalties for falling out of the top tier were extremely severe.

Clyde, of course, could not resist the twin temptations of automatic relegation and visiting new locations. Relegated in 1923–24, Clyde spent two seasons in Division Two playing against the likes of [[Armadale F.C.|Armadale]], [[Arthurlie F.C.|Arthurlie]], [[Bathgate F.C.|Bathgate]], [[Bo'ness F.C.|Bo'ness]], [[Broxburn F.C.|Broxburn]], [[King's Park F.C.|king's Park]], [[Nithsdale Wanderers F.C.|Nithsdale Wanderers]] and [[St Bernard's F.C.|St Bernard's]]. Escape via automatic promotion was achieved in the [[1925–26 in Scottish football|1925–26 season]] and coincided with the demise of Division Three and many of the smaller teams returning to other leagues and Junior football.

This upswing in Clyde's fortunes was demonstrated by winning the Glasgow Cup for the second time in 1926 with a 2–1 victory over Celtic. Now that Clyde were back in the top flight, could they stay there? Until the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the answer was a resounding "yes" as Clyde maintained a respectable mid-table status. [[Danny Blair]] was a prominent international full back of this era and [[Billy Boyd (footballer)|Billy Boyd]] became Clyde's top marksman with 32 goals in season 1932–33 and earned two international caps.

Yet Clyde and financial problems were never far apart and liquidation was again narrowly averted around 1930. Clyde needed to find an answer to their money problems and it lay right in front of them. Greyhound and other animal racing was booming in the late 1920s and several clubs saw this as a way to supplement their income. A company offered to lease Shawfield in 1926 and also give a percentage of the gate money to Clyde. It seemed too good to be true; and it proved to be so. Animal racing was forbidden in the deeds of Shawfield and the League was very set against greyhound racing in general.

However, Clyde at that time had a very cunning and dogged chairman called John McMahon. He would not let the idea go and after years of wrangling a solution was arrived at. The Shawfield Greyhound Racing Company Limited started racing in 1932 and a few years later purchased the stadium from Clyde. Largely financed and owned by Clyde's directors, at a stroke the club had secured its future and found an additional source of revenue. On the other hand, Clyde had sold Shawfield to another party (however close at the time) and would never be able to raise money using the land asset as collateral. Although it would not be appreciated until the 1980s, Clyde were tenants at the mercy of whoever owned Shawfield.

January 1939 saw Clyde at home to [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] in the 1st Round of the Scottish Cup, A 2–0 victory sent Clyde on their way. The next tie saw a very difficult trip to Dundee and a goalless draw ensued. Four days later Clyde squeezed past the [[Dens Park]] men with a 1–0 victory. [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]], and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] were the formidable 3rd Round opponents. Despite fourteen League titles and six Cup victories between 1920 and 1939, Rangers were no match for the Bully Wee as they crashed to a 4–1 defeat. Willie Martin, Clyde's prolific centre forward, scored all four goals and surely set a record for an opposition forward at Ibrox. Returning to Shawfield for the 4th Round, Clyde narrowly defeated neighbours [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]], 1–0. Suddenly it was semi-final time once again with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] standing between Clyde and another final. Although disadvantaged by playing the tie in Edinburgh at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]], Clyde again triumphed with a 1–0 victory.

[[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] provided Clyde's opposition on 22 April 1939. They had scored far more goals on the way to [[Hampden Park|Hampden]] and were installed as favourites. Clyde (Brown; Kirk & Hickie; Beaton, Falloon & Weir; Robertson & Gillies; Martin; Noble & Wallace) had other ideas though. Winning the toss and with a strong wind behind them, Motherwell began very strongly and unsettled Clyde with Brown seeing plenty of action. Riding the storm, Clyde settled and scored the vital goal after thirty minutes. Robertson sped down the right and crossed to Wallace. The forward gathered the ball and smashed the ball into the roof of the net. Motherwell replied with more pressure but could not find a goal before the interval. In the second period Martin quickly doubled Clyde's advantage with an opportunist's strike. The fight went from Motherwell and Clyde scored two more in the closing minutes. Motherwell's keeper blocked Noble's first strike at goal, but he swept home the rebound. Barely a minute later Noble supplied a cross for Martin to complete the scoring and seal a 4–0 victory. After so many attempts and so much heartache the Cup was finally won!

Although the joy of victory was unconfined it was tempered against a background of imminent war with Germany. The [[1939–40 in Scottish football|1939–40 season]] had hardly begun when war was declared and the Scottish League was suspended and all players' contracts declared void. After the initial panic leagues were restarted with an East/West regional split. Again Clyde had sustained football during very difficult times and had no idea what lay ahead in an economy shattered by war. The regional split seen Clyde join the [[Southern Football League (Scotland)|Southern League]] where Clyde finished runners up and only three points behind eventual champions Rangers during the [[1940–41 in Scottish football|1940–41 season]]. Clyde performed relatively well during wartime football in both league and cup football.

===1946–1969===
The team showed steady league form just after the war and reached a fourth [[Scottish Cup]] final in [[1948–49 Scottish Cup|1948–49]]. In only the fourth edition of the competition since Clyde won it in 1938–39, their opponents [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] ran out comfortable 4–1 winners in front of a crowd of 108,000 at [[Hampden Park|Hampden]], with Peter Galletly scoring Clyde's consolation goal.<ref name=1946to1970>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/club/history/post-war/ | title=Club History 1946–1969 | publisher=Clyde FC | accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>

The 1950s began with relegation from [[Scottish Division One|Division A]] in [[1950–51 Scottish Division One|1950–51]], returning at the first attempt as [[Scottish Division Two|Division B]] champions in [[1951–52 Scottish Division Two|1951–52]]. The team repeated the feat in [[1955–56 Scottish Division One|1955–56]] and [[1956–57 Scottish Division Two|1956–57]]. Each occasion saw the team bounce back to very strong finishes in Division A. Floodlighting was introduced at Shawfield in March 1954. The first opposition was [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in a [[Exhibition match|friendly]] match. Huddersfield won 3–2. Cup success came readily in the 1950s. They won the [[Scottish Cup]] in [[1954–55 Scottish Cup|1954–55]] and [[1957–58 Scottish Cup|1957–58]] and were beaten semi-finalists in [[1955–56 Scottish Cup|1955–56]] and [[1959–60 Scottish Cup|1959–60]]. They also reached [[Scottish League Cup]] semi-finals in [[1956–57 Scottish League Cup|1956–57]] and [[1957–58 Scottish League Cup|1957–58]], but lost on both occasions to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]].<ref name=1946to1970/>

The route to the 1954–55 Final began with three straight home victories  in the competition against [[Albion Rovers F.C.|Albion Rovers]] (3–0), [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] (3–1) and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] (5–0). [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] provided Clyde's semi-final opponents. After a 2–2 draw at [[Easter Road]], a solitary goal in the replay sent Clyde in to the final. On 23 April 1955 at [[Hampden Park|Hampden]] in front of over 96,000, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], installed as firm favourites, provided the oppositon in the final, in a match that was also the first to be televised live.<ref name=1946to1970/>

Without forward, [[Billy McPhail]], and goalkeeper, [[William Wilson (goalkeeper)|William Wilson]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://qosfc.com/AboutQueens/QueensLegends/tabid/115/Default.aspx | title=1955 Aberdeen v Clyde SC SF | publisher=QOS FC | accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Clyde lined up:- Hewkins, [[Albie Murphy|Murphy]] & [[Harry Haddock|Haddock]]; [[Ralph Granville|Granville]], Anderson & [[Davie Laing|Laing]]; [[John Divers (footballer born 1931)|Divers]] & [[Archie Robertson (footballer)|Robertson]]; [[Ally Hill|Hill]]; [[George Brown (footballer born 1928)|Brown]] & [[Tommy Ring|Ring]]. Celtic took the lead in a scrappy match and were three minutes from victory until Archie Robertson scored direct from a corner kick to earn a replay. A crowd of over 68,000 gathered for the replay, which was a more open affair. Clyde, with the same line up, won 1–0 and their second Scottish Cup, with Tommy Ring's second half strike.<ref name=1946to1970/>

Back at Hampden again on 26 April 1958 in front of a crowd of 94,000 to face a powerful [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] team, Clyde lined up:- [[Tommy McCulloch (goalkeeper)|McCulloch]], [[Albie Murphy|Murphy]] & [[Harry Haddock|Haddock]]; Walters, Finlay & Clinton; [[George Herd|Herd]] & Currie; [[John Coyle|Coyle]]; [[Archie Robertson (footballer)|Robertson]] & [[Tommy Ring|Ring]]. Johnny Coyle's deflected shot in poor conditions gave Clyde a 1–0 win and a second Scottish Cup in three seasons and third overall. A fourth place league finish and a Scottish League Cup semi-final appearance completed an impressive season in [[1957–58 in Scottish football|1957–58]].<ref name=1946to1970/> Haddock, Robertson and Coyle were selected in the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]] [[1958 FIFA World Cup squads#.C2.A0Scotland|Scotland squad]]. Dan Currie was selected in the provisional Scotland World Cup squad, but ultimately did not make the final cut.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.scottishleague.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3372&hilit=clyde+football+club&sid=25df8e2bd45e546d9714f30414353ec9&start=15 | title=Called Up But Not Capped | publisher=ScottishLeague.net | date=5 September 2012 | accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>

In 1960, Clyde gained entry in to the [[Anglo-Franco-Scottish Friendship Cup|Friendship Cup]]. It was an inter-League competition between four clubs each from [[Football in England|England]], [[Football in France|France]] and [[Football in Scotland|Scotland]], with results aggregated to provide the 'best' League. It proved to be an unpopular format and was dropped in 1962. For the record, Clyde were drawn against [[RC Lens]] of France and beat them 4–0 away and 2–1 at [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]]. The club began the 1960s as a yo-yo club. Relegations in [[1960–61 Scottish Division One|1960–61]] and [[1962–63 Scottish Division One|1962–63]] were followed by immediate promotions in [[1961–62 Scottish Division Two|1961–62]] and [[1963–64 Scottish Division Two|1963–64]], the former as Division Two champions.<ref name=1946to1970/>

The [[1966–67 in Scottish football|1966–67]] season lead Clyde to their highest league finish in forty five years and another Scottish cup semi-final appearance. Competing largely as a part-time team, Clyde finished third behind the [[Old Firm]]. After producing a wonderful season of football that has marked the high tide in the club's fortunes to date, [[UEFA competitions|European football]] was denied. The [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] had a rule that stipulated only one team per city could enter. Clyde argued that they were not from Glasgow, they were from [[Rutherglen]]. However UEFA denied this argument citing Clyde's non-membership of the Lanarkshire FA and their participation in the [[Glasgow Cup]].<ref>https://www.sundaypost.com/opinion/r-i-p-davie-white/</ref> Rangers had that position. Another League Cup semi-final was reached in [[1968–69 Scottish League Cup|1968–69]].<ref name=1946to1970/>

As the 1960s came to a close, Clyde were competing rather comfortably in the top division. It was a different story on the terraces with Glasgow's slum clearance programme hitting attendances hard. Large swathes of housing in the [[Bridgeton, Glasgow|Bridgeton]], [[Dalmarnock]], [[Gorbals]], [[Oatlands, Glasgow|Oatlands]] and [[Rutherglen]] were being demolished with the inhabitants decanted away to other parts of the city and beyond. Clyde's core support was drawn from these areas and sadly many of them have never returned to follow the team.<ref name=1946to1970/>

===1970–1993===
The club began the decade as in previous decades with the threat of relegation of hanging around. In an attempt to quit the city, there was an attempted merger with [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]]. Hamilton, in dire financial trouble, had resigned from the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]]. After the move floundered as quickly as it arose, Hamilton quickly rejoined the League. Less than a year later, [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] of [[Scottish Division Two|Division Two]] made an audacious bid to merge with Clyde in [[Scottish Division One|Division One]] at the time in return for a cash settlement. The Scottish League quickly quashed the move, after viewing it as Dumbarton trying to gain back door entry in to the top division.<ref name=1970to1993>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/club/history/changes/ | title=Club History 1970–1993 | publisher=Clyde FC | accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref>

After relegation in [[1971–72 Scottish Division One|1971–72]], many club legends such as [[Harry Glasgow]], Sam Hastings, [[Tommy McCulloch]], Graham McFarlane and [[Eddie Mulheron]] moved on. Clyde did recover and won promotion as Division Two champions in [[1972–73 Scottish Division Two|1972–73]]. A two-year spell in the top division until another relegation in [[1974–75 Scottish Division One|1974–75]] would be their last in the top division to date. The [[Scottish Premier Division|Premier Division]] was introduced ahead of season [[1975–76 in Scottish football|1975–76]] as the new top division, with inclusion based upon league position. A poor 16th-place finish in Division One in season 1974–75 meant Clyde were never in contention. The club now found themselves back in the second tier, now known as the [[Scottish First Division|First Division]].<ref name=1970to1993/>

The club found a new role, discovering and developing talent before selling it on. Shawfield was the starting point for future [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] internationalists like [[Steve Archibald]], [[Ian Ferguson (footballer born 1967)|Ian Ferguson]] and [[Pat Nevin]]. Problems on and off the pitch saw Clyde move in to freefall. After finishing bottom of the First Division in [[1975–76 Scottish First Division|1975–76]], they found themselves in the [[Scottish Second Division|Second Division]], the third tier, for season [[1976–77 Scottish Second Division|1976–77]]. They only could muster a seventh-place finish. In a decade Clyde had gone from the third best team in Scotland to a single spot above the finishing last in the [[Scottish football league system]]. Towards the end of the season, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] legend [[Billy McNeill]] took charge but left for Aberdeen after only a few months at the helm. The club then turned to the relatively unknown, [[Craig Brown (footballer, born 1940)|Craig Brown]], and he had immediate success as the team won the Second Division in [[1977–78 Scottish Second Division|1977–78]].<ref name=1970to1993/>

Problems were arising at Shawfield. The stadium was falling into a state of disrepair and the grounds were not being maintained. By the late 1970s Shawfield came into the hands of the [[Greyhound Racing Association]] (GRA). [[Greyhound racing]] had been in decline since 1963 when off-course betting was allowed. To compensate for this the GRA had transformed itself into a property company and had a policy of acquiring and redeveloping dog tracks for commercial and residential uses.<ref name=1970to1993/>

Relegation from the First Division in [[1979–80 Scottish First Division|1979–80]] was followed by another promotion as Second Division champions in [[1981–82 Scottish First Division|1981–82]]. Shawfield eventually came on the open market in 1983 with a £500,000 price tag. The club were served with a notice to quit Shawfield by 1986. [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]] provided the final opposition at Shawfield on 28 April 1986. Clyde claimed a 4–2 win. The unpopular but necessary decision was taken to ground-share with city rivals, Partick Thistle. Clyde spent five unhappy seasons at Firhill and there was sense of relief when Clyde departed. The club were grateful for the use of Firhill but there was an underlying sense of being tolerated as an inconvenient annoyance.<ref name=1970to1993/>

The 'Gypsy Army' reference came into being as Clyde supporters sought pride and solace during the club's homeless years. The club then negotiated a ground-share at [[Douglas Park]] with Hamilton Academical, where Clyde resided there for two and a half seasons as plans were developed and implemented to build a new home in [[Cumbernauld]].<ref name=1970to1993/> Meanwhile, on the field, relegation from the First Division in [[1990–91 Scottish First Division|1990–91]], was followed by promotion again as Second Division champions in [[1992–93 Scottish First Division|1992–93]] and an immediate relegation in [[1993–94 Scottish First Division|1993–94]]. This continued the tradition of the yo-yo existence the club had become known for at certain times in previous decades.

===1994–present===

The Cumbernauld Development Corporation was keen to have a sports stadium and professional football team to promote the town, and [[Cumbernauld]], with a 50,000+ population, seemed fertile ground on which to grow a new support. A new site called "[[Broadwood Stadium|Broadwood]]" was to have an integrated business, housing and leisure development with a football stadium at the heart of it. With the help of Football Trust backing two modern stands began to emerge during the early 1990s.

The Scottish League unusually granted permission for Clyde to switch grounds mid season, and former landlords, [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], were the inaugural opposition on 5 February 1994. A capacity crowd of 6000 watched as Clyde lost to the Accies 2–0.

Clyde dropped to the third tier of football and in 1998 they almost dropped into the lowest reaches of Senior football. This was enough for new chairman, Billy Carmichael, to introduce changes. Ronnie MacDonald was appointed as manager, having previously worked at [[Maryhill F.C.|Maryhill Juniors]]. MacDonald signed a whole squad from the Junior ranks and within two seasons Clyde had gained promotion.  Subsequently Allan Maitland won promotion to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] in 1999.

The [[2003–04 in Scottish football|2003–04 season]] Clyde were top of the League and looked set for the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]]. But Broadwood did not comply with SPL requirements and crucially Clyde were on the brink of being petitioned by their creditors and liquidated. While the chairman's fortune was being spent on players' wages, very little else was being serviced. The SPL relented and said Clyde could join them if the fourth stand was built. North Lanarkshire Council started the groundworks and then abruptly halted them as they became aware of Clyde's financial plight. Plan B, playing at [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], was investigated.  In the event, a draw with [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]] and a home loss to [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] meant that Clyde missed out on promotion.

The Clyde Supporters' Trust formed during the [[2003–04 in Scottish football|2003–04 season]]. Early that season some concerned fans met knowing that the chairman could not keep financing the Club indefinitely.  The timing of the Trust's formation coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion and the chairman sought to sell his majority shareholding. Following lengthy negotiations a consortium of the Trust and traditional investors gained the majority shareholding for a nominal sum. The Clyde Development Consortium took control of funds gathered by fans and investors and used it to finance the Club through a CVA to clear the debts. In June 2005 the CVA was completed and Clyde were essentially debt free.

In a season, [[2005–06 in Scottish football|2005–06]], that saw Clyde lead 2–1 from 1–0 behind at [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in a [[2005–06 Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] tie with 17 minutes left before a goalkeeping error gifted Rangers an equalizer, with Clyde going on to lose in extra time,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2005/09/20/1513/ | title=Rangers 5–2 Clyde (AET) | publisher=Clyde FC | date=20 September 2005 | accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> the other half of the [[Old Firm]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] visited Broadwood in the [[Scottish Cup]] on 8 January 2006.

Former [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] [[Captain (association football)|captain]] [[Colin Hendry]] was appointed manager in summer 2007. On 14 August of that year, Clyde history was made when [[Michael Doherty (footballer)|Michael Doherty]] became the youngest person ever to play for Clyde in a competitive match,<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.hamiltonadvertiser.co.uk/news/2007/08/23/michael-is-the-bully-wee-x2019-s-youngest-star-50144-19677693/|title = Michael is the Bully Wee's youngest star|publisher = hamiltonadvertiser.co.uk|date = 23 August 2007|accessdate = 24 July 2012}}</ref> a feat later broken by [[Connor Stevenson]] in a league match at [[Palmerston Park|Palmerston]] on 25 April 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2009/04/27/3133/ | title=Connor Makes Clyde History | publisher=Clyde FC | date=27 April 2009 | accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref>

Clyde entered the final game of the season needing to better Morton's result to avoid being forced into the play-offs. Clyde won their game 3–0, but in a cruel twist of fate Morton won their own game by the same scoreline, sending Clyde into a two-legged play-off with Second Division side [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]]. Clyde lost the first leg 2–1 and at 3–1 down in the home second leg looked as good as relegated. However, a thrilling fight back saw Clyde level at 5–5 on aggregate (4–3 on the day) before adding another goal in [[extra time]] to progress. Home and away victories over [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]] in the play-off final then secured First Division football at Broadwood for another season.

However the following season Clyde finished bottom of the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] and were relegated to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Meanwhile, off the park, financial problems were once again apparent. In a hope to try and avoid administration in June 2009, Clyde terminated the contracts of the entire first team squad, with only youngsters remaining under contract at the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/clyde/8093850.stm|title=Clyde scrap contracts to survive|publisher=BBC Sport|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=10 June 2009}}</ref> The squad for 2009–10 was rebuilt on a drastically reduced budget with a repeat of open trials which were successful in 2005.

After a brief upturn in results, Clyde went six games without a win and on Saturday 21 November, with the team sitting three points adrift at the bottom of the Second Division, it was announced John Brown had left his position as manager.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2009/11/21/3358/|title = Brown Leaves|date = 21 November 2009|accessdate = 21 November 2009}}</ref> On Monday 5 April John McCormack was sacked by Clyde.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2010/04/05/3511/ | title = Club Statement: John McCormack | publisher = Clyde FC | date = 5 April 2010 | accessdate = 23 July 2012}}</ref>

More history was made in a home match with [[Peterhead F.C.|Peterhead]] on 17 April 2010, when Willie Sawyers scored after only eight seconds, which became the fastest Clyde goal ever recorded.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2010/04/20/3528/ | title=Willie Makes Clyde History | date=20 April 2010 | accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Despite this, the club was subsequently relegated for the second season in a row, dropping down to the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and made a disastrous start to the campaign including an 8–1 thrashing at the hands of [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]].

==Grounds==
[[Image:shawfield 2.jpg|thumb|Shawfield in 1985]]

===Barrowfield Park===
Clyde have had five home grounds since they formed in 1877. The first of these was Barrowfield Park, which was situated on the banks of the River Clyde. Sitting on the edge of Bridgeton, Barrowfield Park lay in a triangle of land enclosed by Carstairs Street, Colvend Street and the river Clyde. The area was an intense mix of chemical, engineering and textile works with a high population density to provide the labour. Although no stadium photographs have emerged it appears the ground consisted of a grand stand running north-south, a pavilion and tennis courts at the southern end and a bicycle track surrounding the pitch.

Today this area is dotted with industrial units, but also contains a large grassed area. So it may be possible to stand upon a corner of the original Barrowfield pitch. Barrowfield was originally shared with a short-lived team called Albatross.

===Shawfield Stadium===
By 1898, Barrowfield became too small in capacity to deal with the large crowds of spectators. The club then moved across the river to build a new stadium, which would be known as [[Shawfield Stadium]].

A crowd of 10,000 saw the first match at Shawfield against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. In 1908, a crowd of 52,000 gathered for a match against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], which remains Clyde's record home attendance to this day. Financial pressures led to the club relinquishing ownership of the stadium in 1935, selling it their former tenants, the Greyhound Racing Association. This arrangement continued satisfactorily for over 50 years, until the GRA announced redevelopment plans for the stadium and gave Clyde notice to quit in 1986.

===Broadwood Stadium===
Broadwood is a football stadium and multi-use community sports complex situated in [[Cumbernauld]], [[North Lanarkshire]], Scotland. In 1990, Clyde had secured an agreement to move into a stadium being built in the new town of Cumbernauld, which due to shifting population patterns was by now one of the larger settlements in Scotland without a senior football team.  The new all-seater venue would not be ready until 1994 for Clyde to move into.

Clyde moved into [[Broadwood Stadium|Broadwood]] mid way through the [[1994–95 in Scottish football|1994–95]] season. Broadwood has hosted [[Scotland national under-21 football team|Scotland U21]] matches and four [[Scottish League Challenge Cup|Scottish Challenge Cup]] finals in the past. Broadwood was also home to [[Airdrieonians F.C. (1878)|Airdrie]] for four seasons from 1994–98 and [[Rangers F.C. Reserve and Youth squads|Rangers reserves]] for a while.

On 9 December 2010, Clyde had informed their landlords at North Lanarkshire Council (NL Leisure) of their intention to relinquish their lease on Broadwood and move elsewhere.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/clyde/9276400.stm Clyde planning to leave Broadwood Stadium]</ref> Furthermore, on 19 October 2011, Clyde revealed that they were investigating the possibility of a move to [[East Kilbride]], the largest town in Scotland without a senior football team.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/15378782.stm Clyde investigate move to new stadium in East Kilbride]</ref> Another option is to move back to Rutherglen and develop the Clyde Gateway Stadium in a ground-sharing agreement. This has received approval from current tenants [[Rutherglen Glencairn F.C.|Rutherglen Glencairn]].<ref>[http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2012/09/17/4195/ Rutherglen Approve Proposal]</ref>

===Ground shares===
After quitting Shawfield in 1986, the club investigated a number of local options, Clyde secured an agreement with arch-rivals [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] to share their ground [[Firhill Stadium|Firhill]] for five seasons until 1991. Despite reaching an agreement to move into Broadwood in 1990, it would not be until 1994 when the club actually moved in, so Clyde groundshared with [[Hamilton Academical F.C.|Hamilton Accies]] at their [[Douglas Park]] for a further three seasons.
[[File:Firhill at night.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Firhill Stadium|Firhill]], home of [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], which has previously been used by Clyde]]

The club negotiated a groundshare with [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa]] to use [[Recreation Park, Alloa|Recreation Park]] for the club's first home game of the [[2012–13 Clyde F.C. season|2012–13]] season,<ref>{{cite news|title=Ramsden Cup Draw|url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2012/06/12/4128/|publisher=clydefc.co.uk|date=12 June 2012|accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> a first round [[2012–13 Scottish Challenge Cup|Challenge Cup]] match against [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Clyde 0–1 Partick Thistle|url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2012/07/28/4154/|publisher=clydefc.co.uk|date=28 July 2012|accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> During pre-season work had begun at Broadwood to replace the grass pitch with an artificial surface ([[astroturf]])<ref>{{cite news|title=Work Begins at Broadwoad|url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2012/06/05/4120/|publisher=clydefc.co.uk|date=5 June 2012|accessdate=17 October 2012}}</ref> and the pitch was not finished in time for their first home match of the season.

==Supporters==

The supporters' fiercest rivalry is with [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]], given that the two clubs are both of smaller stature to that of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. However, given the success and promotion of Partick Thistle to the [[Scottish Premiership]], and Clyde's recent relegation to the [[Scottish League Two]], such derby games have become a rarity in recent years.

The number of years Clyde spent without a permanent home of their own has led to the fans identifying themselves as the ''[[Romani people|Gypsy]] Army'' in reference to this.

The Clyde Supporters' Trust was formed during season 2003–04. A group of fans became aware of the club's severe financial problems as Billy Charmichael's reign as chairman came to an end. Formed in time to save the club and keep it in the supporter's hands in a time that coincided with Clyde's failure to gain promotion and the chairman looking to sell his majority shareholding.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Supporters' Trust|url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/supporters-trust/history/|publisher=clydefc.co.uk|accessdate=16 October 2012}}</ref>

In the past the Supporters' Trust has financed the signings of players such as [[John Potter (footballer)|John Potter]] and [[Tom Brighton]], and retaining the signatures of players such as [[Neil McGregor]] and [[David Hutton (footballer born 1985)|David Hutton]].

The Clyde supporters also run their own supporters team called Bully Wee United.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bully Wee United|url=http://www.clubwebsite.co.uk/bullyweeunited/134943/Home|publisher=clubwebsite.co.uk/bullyweeunited|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> Bully Wee United are recognised as the official supporters team of Clyde and represent the club in the IFA League<ref>http://www.internetfootball.org.uk/ifa-competitions/ifa-league/</ref> with matches being played Saturday mornings. Matches are normally against the supporters teams of the opposition facing the first team on the same day. Bully Wee United are unique in most Scottish supporters teams as they operate a strict policy that only Clyde supporters may play for the team. Players must attend a minimum number of Clyde games over a season. Clyde are also represented in the Scottish Supporters League by another supporters team named Broadwood Clyde. They were formed in 1994. They were crowned SSFL Division One league champions in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bully Wee Fans Crowned The Best in Scotland|url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2005/08/11/1472/|publisher=clydefc.co.uk|date=11 August 2005|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> They also won the SSFL League Cup in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broadwood Clyde Lift League Cup|url=http://www.clydefc.co.uk/news/2004/07/20/1015/|publisher=clydefc.co.uk|date=20 July 2004|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> Broadwood Clyde play their homes games at Ravenswood in Cumbernauld on Sunday afternoons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broadwood Clyde|url=http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.broadwood-clyde.co.uk%2F|publisher=broadwood-clyde.co.uk|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref>

==Nickname==
The club's nickname, "The Bully Wee", is of uncertain origin although the club themselves have advanced three theories.<ref>[http://www.clydefc.co.uk/club/history/origins/ Bully Wee Theory]</ref>

The first suggests that the clubs and supporters and perhaps players mainly came from [[Bridgeton, Glasgow]], a tough working class area whose inhabitants had a reputation as "wee bullies", with this becoming transposed as the Bully Wee.

Alternatively it is also claimed that it comes from around 1900 when a group of French supporters paid a visit to Barrowfield and, upon the scoring of a disputed goal, were heard to remark  "But il'y, oui?" or "Their goal, yes". This unfamiliar phrase was heard by supporters as "Bully Wee" and the name stuck.

Finally the third theory, and the one accepted by the club as the most plausible, links the term to the old Victorian idiom "bully" meaning first-rate or high standard and suggests that Clyde, a small club, would have been regularly referred to as "Bully Wee Clyde", with the first two words eventually becoming the standalone nickname.

==Rivalries==
Originally from Glasgow, Clyde developed local rivalries with other teams from in and around the city including [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] and [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queens Park]] and from previous years now defunct teams like [[Clydebank F.C.|Clydebank]] and [[Third Lanark F.C.|Third Lanark]]. Any game between any of these two would be known as a [[Local derbies in the United Kingdom#Senior football|Glasgow derby]].

It has been said that Partick Thistle are who the Bully Wee's main derby is with. The Clyde vs Thistle derby was previously a fierce battle between two of Glasgow's smaller clubs, in comparison to the [[Old Firm]]. However, due to Partick Thistle's promotion to Scotland's highest professional league, the [[Scottish Premiership]], and Clyde's recent delegations to the lower leagues, such meetings between the two clubs are no longer so common.

In recent times, the rivalry was intensified when Thistle became Clyde's landlords at [[Firhill Stadium|Firhill]] for five years. The decision to groundshare with Thistle was never really accepted by either Clyde or Thistle supporters. The Clyde fans preferred to watch dog-racing at [[Shawfield Stadium|Shawfield]] in [[Rutherglen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=When Saturday comes|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/950-The-five-minute.../2926-partick-thistle|publisher=wsc.co.uk|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>

From late 2010 onwards, Clyde have been looking to leave [[Broadwood Stadium|Broadwood]] for a new home. In early 2012, Partick Thistle chairman David Beattie said he welcome a deal to see Clyde groundshare at Firhill once more. He said it would reignite the Glasgow-rivalry and would benefit both clubs. "I am all for ground-sharing and Clyde are traditionally a Glasgow club and the healthy rivalry between ourselves and the Bully Wee is historical".<ref>{{cite news|title=Firhill groundshare would add welcome edge to Partick Thistle – Clyde rivalry, says Jags chief Beattie|url=http://www.theglaswegian.co.uk/football/partick-thistle-fc/partick-thistle-news/2012/03/22/firhill-groundshare-would-add-welcome-edge-to-partick-thistle-clyde-rivalry-says-jags-chief-beattie-102692-23797620/|publisher=theglaswegian.co.uk|date=22 March 2012|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>
