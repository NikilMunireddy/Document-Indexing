The '''Hawaiian Islands''' ({{lang-haw|Mokupuni o Hawai‘i}}) are an [[archipelago]] of eight major [[island]]s, several [[atoll]]s, numerous smaller [[islet]]s, and undersea [[seamount]]s in the North [[Pacific Ocean]], extending some {{convert|1500|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} from the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] in the south to northernmost [[Kure Atoll]]. Formerly the group was known to Europeans and Americans as the "'''Sandwich Islands'''", a name chosen by [[James Cook]] in honor of the then First Lord of the Admiralty [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]]. The contemporary name is derived from the name of the main island, Hawaii Island.

The [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaiian monarchy]] was overthrown in 1893 and the United States annexed the islands in 1898.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Hawaii: Islands Under the Influence|last = Kent|first = Noel J.|publisher = University of Hawaii Press|year = 1993|isbn = 0-8248-1552-1|location = |pages = x}}</ref> The [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]] now occupies the archipelago almost in its entirety (including the uninhabited [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]]), with the sole exception of [[Midway Atoll|Midway Island]], which is instead an [[unincorporated territory]] within the [[United States Minor Outlying Islands]].

The Hawaiian Islands are the exposed peaks of a great undersea mountain range known as the [[Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain]], formed by [[volcano|volcanic]] activity over a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] in the [[Earth's mantle]]. The islands are about {{convert|1860|mi|km|-2}} from the nearest continent.<ref>Macdonald, Abbott, and Peterson, 1984</ref>

==Geology==
{{Main|Hawaii hotspot}}
This chain of islands, or [[archipelago]], developed as the Pacific [[Plate tectonics|plate]] moved slowly northwestward over a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] in the [[Earth's mantle]] at a rate of approximately {{convert|32|mi|km|}} per million years. Thus, the southeast island is volcanically active whereas the islands on the northwest end of the archipelago are older and typically smaller, due to longer exposure to [[erosion]]. The age of the archipelago has been estimated using potassium-argon dating methods.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Tectonics, geochronology, and origin of the Hawaiian-Emperor Volcanic Chain |url= http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/Faculty/Morden/BotZool450/Clague1989.pdf |work= The Geology of North America, Volume N: The Eastern Pacific Ocean and Hawaii |year= 1989 |accessdate=2011-01-17 |publisher= The Geology Society of America }}</ref> From this study and others,<ref>{{Cite journal|title= Potassium-Argon Ages of Lavas from the Hawi and Pololu Volcanic Series, Kohala Volcano, Hawaii |url= http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/83/12/3731.abstract |publisher= Geology Society of American Bulletin |year=1972 |volume=83 |pages= 3731–3738 |accessdate= 2011-01-17|doi= 10.1130/0016-7606(1972)83[3731:PAOLFT]2.0.CO;2|last1= McDougall|first1= IAN|last2= Swanson|first2= D.

The only active volcanism in the last 200 years has been on the southeastern island, Hawai{{okina}}i, and on the submerged but growing volcano to the extreme southeast, [[Loihi|Lo{{okina}}ihi]]. The [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] of the U. S. Geological Survey documents recent volcanic activity and provides images and interpretations of the volcanism.

Almost all of the [[magma]] of the hotspot has the composition of [[basalt]], and so the Hawaiian volcanoes are composed almost entirely of this igneous rock. There is very little coarser-grained [[gabbro]] and [[diabase]]. [[Nephelinite]] is exposed on the islands but is extremely rare. The majority of eruptions in Hawai{{okina}}i are [[Hawaiian eruption|Hawaiian-type eruption]]s because basaltic magma is relatively fluid compared with magmas typically involved in more explosive eruptions, such as the andesitic magmas that produce some of the spectacular and dangerous eruptions around the margins of the Pacific basin.

[[File:Hawaii hotspot.jpg|thumb|250px|Eruptions from the [[Hawaii hotspot]] left a trail of underwater mountains across the Pacific over millions of years, called the [[Emperor Seamounts]]]]

Hawai{{okina}}i island (the Big Island) is the biggest and youngest island in the chain, built from five volcanoes. [[Mauna Loa]], taking up over half of the Big Island, is the largest [[shield volcano]] on the Earth. The measurement from sea level to summit is more than {{convert|2.5|mi|km|0}}, from sea level to sea floor about {{convert|3.1|mi|km|0}}.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Mauna Loa Earth's Largest Volcano |url= http://wwwhvo.wr.usgs.gov/maunaloa/ |work= Hawaiian Volcano Observatory web site |publisher= USGS |date = February 2006|accessdate=2009-12-09 }}</ref>

===Earthquakes===
The Hawaiian Islands have many [[earthquake]]s, generally caused by volcanic activity. Most of the early earthquake monitoring took place in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]], by missionaries [[Titus Coan]], Sarah J. Lyman and her family. From 1833 to 1896, approximately 4 or 5 earthquakes were reported per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/hawaii/history.php |title= Hawaii Earthquake History |accessdate=2009-12-09 |work= Earthquake Hazards Program |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |year=1972 }}</ref>

Hawaii accounted for 7.3% of the United States' reported earthquakes with a [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude]] 3.5 or greater from 1974 to 2003, with a total 1533 earthquakes. Hawaii ranked as the state with the third most earthquakes over this time period, after [[Alaska]] and [[California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/states/top_states.php |title= Top Earthquake States |accessdate=2009-12-09 |work= Earthquake Hazards Program |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |year=2003 }}</ref>

On October 15, 2006, there was an [[2006 Hawaii earthquake|earthquake]] with a magnitude of 6.7 off the northwest coast of the island of Hawaii, near the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]] area of the big island. The initial earthquake was followed approximately five minutes later by a magnitude 5.7 [[aftershock]]. Minor-to-moderate damage was reported on most of the Big Island. Several major roadways became impassable from rock slides, and effects were felt as far away as [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], Oahu, nearly {{convert|150|mi|km}} from the [[epicenter]]. Power outages lasted for several hours to days. Several water mains ruptured. No deaths or life-threatening injuries were reported.

Earthquakes are monitored by the [[Hawaiian Volcano Observatory]] run by the [[USGS]].

==Tsunamis==
[[File:1960-Chilean-tsunami-Hilo-HI-USGS.jpg|thumb|right|Aftermath of the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake|1960 Chilean tsunami]] in [[Hilo]], Hawai{{okina}}i, where the tsunami left 61 people dead and 282 seriously injured. The waves reached {{convert|35|ft|m|0}} high.]]
The Hawaiian Islands are subject to [[tsunami]]s, great [[wave]]s that strike the shore. Tsunamis are most often caused by [[earthquake]]s somewhere in the Pacific. The waves produced by the earthquakes travel at speeds of {{convert|400|–|500|mph|km/h|-2}} and can affect coastal regions thousands of miles (kilometers) away.

Tsunamis may also originate from the Hawaiian Islands. Explosive volcanic activity can cause tsunamis. The island of [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]] had a catastrophic collapse or [[debris avalanche]] over a million years ago; this underwater landslide likely caused tsunamis. The [[Hilina Slump]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] is another potential place for a large landslide and resulting tsunami.

The city of [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]] on the Big Island has been most affected by tsunamis, where the in-rushing water is accentuated by the shape of [[Hilo Bay]]. Coastal cities have tsunami warning sirens.

A tsunami resulting from an [[2010 Chile earthquake|earthquake in Chile]] hit the islands on February 27, 2010. It was relatively minor, but local emergency management officials utilized the latest technology and ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. The Governor declared it a "good drill" for the next major event.

A tsunami resulting from an [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|earthquake]] in Japan hit the islands on March 11, 2011. It was relatively minor, but local officials ordered evacuations in preparation for a possible major event. The tsunami caused about $1 million in damages, almost all limited to the Kona coast of the Big Island.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Ecology==
{{See also|Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands}}

The [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] plant and animal species of the Hawaiian Islands developed in nearly complete isolation over about 70 million years.{{clarify|date=November 2014}} Prior to the human arrival, the only native mammals were the [[Hawaiian hoary bat]] and the [[Hawaiian monk seal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/Hawaii/mammal-monk-seal.html|title=Hawaiian Monk Seal|work=statesymbolsusa.org|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2014}}

Human contact, first by [[Polynesians]], introduced new trees, other plants and animals. These included voracious species such as rats and pigs, who took a heavy toll on native birds and invertebrates that evolved in the absence of such predators. The growing population also brought deforestation, forest degradation, treeless grasslands, and environmental degradation. As a result, many species which depended on forest habitats and food became extinct. As humans cleared land for farming, [[Monoculture|monocultural crop production]] replaced [[Polyculture|multi-species systems]].{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

The arrival of the [[European ethnic groups|European]]s had a more significant impact, with the promotion of large-scale single-species export agriculture and livestock grazing. This led to increased clearing of forests, and the development of towns, adding many more species to the [[list of extinct animals of the Hawaiian Islands]]. {{As of|2009}}, many of the remaining endemic species are considered endangered.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Agroforestry Guides for Pacific Islands |editors= Craig R. Elevitch and Kim M. Wilkinson |url= http://www.agroforestry.net/afg/ |isbn= 0-9702544-0-7 |publisher= Permanent Agriculture Resources |year= 2000 }}</ref>

==National Monument==
{{wikinews|Bush proclaims Northwestern Hawaiian Islands a National Monument}}
On June 15, 2006, President [[George W. Bush]] issued a public proclamation creating [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]] under the [[Antiquities Act]] of 1906. The Monument encompasses the northwestern Hawaiian Islands and surrounding waters, forming the largest{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} marine wildlife reserve in the world.
