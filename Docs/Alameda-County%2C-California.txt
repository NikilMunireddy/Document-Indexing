'''Alameda County''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|l|ɨ|'|m|i:|d|ə}}, ''al-uh-ME-duh'') is a [[List of California counties|county]] in the state of [[California]] in the [[United States]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 1,510,271,<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/06/06001.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=April 3, 2016}}</ref> making it the 7th-most populous county in the state.<ref>[http://www.alameda.courts.ca.gov/pages.aspx/about-alameda-county About Alameda County – County of Alameda – Superior Court of California]. Alameda.courts.ca.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-15.</ref> Its [[county seat]] is [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref>

Alameda County is included in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], occupying much of the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] region.

== History ==
The county was formed on March 25, 1853, from a large portion of [[Contra Costa County, California|Contra Costa County]] and a smaller portion of [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]].

The [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''alameda'' means "a place where poplar trees grow," a name originally given to the Arroyo de la Alameda (Poplar Grove Creek).  The [[willow]] and [[sycamore]] trees along the banks of the river reminded the early explorers of a road lined with trees, also known as an ''alameda''.<ref>[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/alameda definition of alameda in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)]</ref><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alameda Alameda – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary]</ref>

The county seat at the time it was formed was located at [[Alvarado, California|Alvarado]]; it was moved to [[San Leandro, California|San Leandro]] in 1856 where the county courthouse was destroyed by the devastating 1868 quake on the [[Hayward Fault]]. The county seat was then re-established in the town of [[Brooklyn, California|Brooklyn]] from 1872-1875. Brooklyn is now part of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], which has been the county seat since 1873.

Much of what is now considered an intensively [[urban area|urban]] region, with major cities, was developed as a [[trolley car suburb]] of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The historical progression from Native American tribal lands to Spanish, then Mexican ranches, then to farms, ranches, and orchards, then multiple city centers and suburbs, is shared with the adjacent and closely associated [[Contra Costa County, California#History|Contra Costa County]].

== Events ==
The annual county fair is held at the [[Alameda County Fairgrounds]] in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]]. The fair runs for three weekends from June to July. Attractions include horse racing, carnival rides, [[4-H]] exhibits, and live bands.

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|821|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|739|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|82|sqmi}} (10%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_06.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 24, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>

The [[San Francisco Bay]] borders the county on the west, and the City and County of [[San Francisco, California]] has a small land border with the city of Alameda due to land filling.<ref>[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ThematicMapFramesetServlet?_bm=y&-tree_id=4001&-_MapEvent=Pan&-context=tm&-errMsg=&-all_geo_types=N&-_useSS=N&-_dBy=140&-redoLog=false&-_zoomLevel=&-tm_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_M00083&-tm_config=|b=50|l=en|t=4001|zf=0.0|ms=thm_def|dw=0.127654448550011|dh=0.07576475132991932|dt=gov.census.aff.domain.map.EnglishMapExtent|if=gif|cx=-122.18653389899086|cy=37.84539209943137|zl=4|pz=4|bo=|bl=|ft=350:349:335:389:388:332:331|fl=403:381:204:380:369:379:368|g=05000US06001|ds=DEC_2000_SF1_U|sb=50|tud=false|db=140|mn=0.6|mx=79.2|cc=1|cm=1|cn=5|cb=|um=Percent|pr=1|th=DEC_2000_SF1_U_M00083|sf=N|sg=&-PANEL_ID=tm_result&-_pageY=&-_lang=en&-_pageX=&-geo_id=05000US06001&-_mapY=&-_mapX=&-_latitude=&-_pan=SW&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&-_longitude=&-_changeMap=Identify American FactFinder].

A coastal plain several miles wide lines the bay; and is Oakland's most populous region. Livermore Valley lies in the eastern part of the county.

The [[Hayward Fault]], a major branch of the San Andreas Fault to the west, runs through the most populated parts of Alameda County, while the [[Calaveras Fault]] runs through the southeastern part of the county.

==Law, government and politics==
[[File:Oakland Court House California USA2.jpg|thumb|[[René C. Davidson Courthouse]], [[Alameda County Superior Court]], Oakland in June 2009]]

===Government===
{{main|Government of Alameda County, California}}

The [[Government of Alameda County, California|Government of Alameda County]] is defined and authorized under the [[California Constitution]], [[California law]], and the Charter of the County of Alameda.<ref>California Government Code § 23004</ref> Much of the [[Government of California]] is in practice the responsibility of county governments such as the Government of Alameda County, while municipalities such as the city of [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and the city of [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] provide additional, often non-essential services. The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, and public health. In addition it is the local government for all unincorporated areas, and provides services such as law enforcement to some incorporated cities under a contract arrangement.

It is composed of the elected five-member [[Alameda County Board of Supervisors]] (BOS) as the county legislature, several other elected offices and officers including the [[Alameda County Sheriff's Department|Sheriff]], the [[Alameda County District Attorney|District Attorney]], [[Alameda County Assessor|Assessor]], [[Alameda County Auditor-Controller/County Clerk/Recorder|Auditor-Controller/County Clerk/Recorder]], and [[Alameda County Treasurer/Tax Collector|Treasurer/Tax Collector]], and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the County Administrator. In addition, several entities of the [[government of California]] have jurisdiction conterminous with Alameda County, such as the [[Alameda County Superior Court]].

The current supervisors are:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.acgov.org/board/|title=Board of Supervisors|publisher=Alameda County|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>
* [[Scott Haggerty]], district 1,
* [[Richard Valle]], district 2,
* [[Wilma Chan]], district 3,
* [[Nate Miley]], district 4, and
* [[Keith Carson]], district 5.

The Board elects a president who presides at all meetings of the Board and appoints committees to handle work involving the major programs of the county. If the president is absent for a meeting, the vice president shall be responsible. A Board election occurs every two years for these positions. Supervisor Miley is serving currently as president; Supervisor Carson is vice president.

The county's law enforcement is overseen by an elected Sheriff/Coroner and an elected District Attorney. The Sheriff supervises the deputies of the [[Alameda County Sheriff's Office]], whose primary responsibilities include policing unincorporated areas of the county and cities within the county which contract with the Sheriff's Office for police services; providing security and law enforcement for county buildings including courthouses, the county jail and other county properties; providing support resources, such as a forensics laboratory and search and rescue capabilities, to other law enforcement agencies throughout the county; and serving the process of the county's Superior Court system. The District Attorney's office is responsible for prosecuting all criminal violations of the laws of the state of California, the county, or its constituent municipalities, in the Alameda County Superior Court. The current Sheriff is [[Gregory J. Ahern]], who was elected in 2006, succeeding [[Charles Plummer (sheriff)|Charles Plummer]], who had served in the post for 20 years.  The Interim District Attorney is [[Nancy E. O'Malley]], who was appointed to fill the position of retiring District Attorney [[Tom Orloff]] in September 2009.  The Sheriff's Office operates two jails: [[Santa Rita Jail]] in [[Dublin, CA|Dublin]], and [[Glenn E. Dyer Detention Facility]] in downtown [[Oakland, CA|Oakland]].

The Alameda County Fire Department (ACFD)<ref>[http://www.acgov.org/fire/ Alameda County Fire Department]</ref> was formed on July 1, 1993 as a dependent district, with the Board of Supervisors as its governing body. Municipal and specialized fire departments have been consolidated into the ACFD over the years. 1993 brought in the Castro Valley and Eden Consolidated FD, and the County Fire Patrol. San Leandro joined in 1995, Dublin in 1997, [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] in 2002, [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in 2007, The [[Alameda County Regional Emergency Communications Center]] in 2008, and Newark and Union City in 2010. Emeryville joined the ACFD in 2012.

The [[Alameda County Water District]] is a special district within Alameda County created to distribute water, but it is not operated by Alameda County administrators. It is operated by an elected board of directors.

[[Alameda County Superior Court]] operates in twelve separate locations throughout the county, with its central [[René C. Davidson Courthouse]] located in Oakland near [[Lake Merritt]].  Most major criminal trials and complex civil cases are heard at this location or in courtrooms within the County Administration Building across the street.

Alameda County is a stronghold of the Democratic Party. It has not voted for a Republican presidential candidate since [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956]], when [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight Eisenhower]] carried the county. Historically, the county was Republican until the 1958 defeat of [[William F. Knowland]]. Even when [[Ronald Reagan]] won the national popular vote by an 18.3% margin in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]], [[Walter Mondale]] won Alameda County by a slightly larger margin. In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] it voted for [[John Kerry]] by a margin of over 75%. Every city and town voted Democratic.<ref>[http://www.ss.ca.gov/elections/sov/2004_general/ssov/pres_general_ssov_all.pdf pres_general_ssov_for_all.xls<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

According to the California Secretary of State, there are 709,414 registered voters in Alameda County.  401,847 (56.6%) are registered Democrats, 116,864 (16.5%) are registered Republicans, 33,689 (4.8%) are registered to minor political parties, and 157,014 (22.1%) declined to answer. This means Democrats have a 40.1% registration advantage over Republicans. Every city, town, and unincorporated area in Alameda County has more registered Democrats than Republicans.

On November 4, 2008 Alameda County voted 62.0% against [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], which won statewide, and which amended the [[California Constitution]] to ban [[same-sex marriage]]. The county garnered the sixth highest "no" vote, by percentage, of all California counties, and was the second largest county, by total voter turnout, to vote against it.<ref>[http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2008_general/sov_complete.pdf ] {{wayback|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2008_general/sov_complete.pdf |date=20121018225250 }}</ref>
