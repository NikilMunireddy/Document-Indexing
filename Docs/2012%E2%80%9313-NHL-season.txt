The '''2012–13 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|96th]] season of operation (95th season of play) of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The regular season began on January 19, 2013 and ended on April 28, 2013, with the [[2013 Stanley Cup playoffs|playoffs]] to follow until June.

The season start was delayed from its original October 11, 2012 date due to a [[2012–13 NHL lockout|lockout]] imposed by the NHL franchise owners after the expiration of the league's [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA). After a new labor agreement was reached between the owners and the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA), training camps opened on January 13, 2013 and a 48-game season (reduced from 82 games) started on January 19. Similar to the [[1994–95 NHL season|1994–95 season]], the shortened regular season was limited to intra-conference competition.<ref name="2012-13 regular season schedule" /> The season calendar opened with the [[2012 NHL Entry Draft]] on June 22–23, 2012, held at the [[Consol Energy Center]] in Pittsburgh.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=379054 |title=Bettman confirms Pittsburgh as 2012 NHL Entry Draft site |publisher=The Sports Network |date=October 27, 2012 |accessdate=2011-12-07}}</ref>

===Lockout===
{{main|2012–13 NHL lockout}}
On September 13, 2012, all 29 league ownership groups (with the [[Phoenix Coyotes]] [[Phoenix Coyotes bankruptcy|collectively owned]] by the NHL) authorized commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] to [[lockout (industry)|lock out]] the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) upon the expiration of the [[NHL collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) on September 15. The action marked the fifth [[labor unrest|labor dispute]] in twenty years for the league, following a [[1992 NHL strike|1992 strike]], lockouts in [[1994–95 NHL lockout|1994–95]] and [[2004–05 NHL lockout|2004–05]], as well as a referees lockout in 1993;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhlofficials.com/about_nhloa.asp |title=About NHLOA |publisher=National Hockey League Officials Association |accessdate=2008-12-26}}</ref> this is more than any of the other [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada]] during this period. In preparation for the lockout, NHL teams assigned all of their eligible players to their [[American Hockey League]] farm clubs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sabres.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=641507 |title=Sabres Loan Eligible Players To Rochester, Amateur Clubs – Buffalo Sabres – News |publisher=Sabres.nhl.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}</ref>

Although Bettman acknowledged the 2005–12 CBA was fair, he also stated that he was demanding concessions as a result of the [[2008–2012 global recession|late 2000s recession]], even though the league experienced significant growth at that time.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/hockey/nhl/wires/09/14/2040.ap.hkn.nhl.labor.q.a.1195/index.html NHL lockout: What you need to know].

The NHL season officially entered a [[2012–13 NHL lockout|lockout]] after the expiration of the CBA on September 15, 2012, prior to the planned start of the pre-season. Locked-out players immediately began signing with the [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL), [[Czech Extraliga]] (ELH), the [[SM-liiga]], and the [[Swedish Hockey League|Elitserien]] (SEL), the last of which [[2012–13 Elitserien season#Short-term contracts|largely resisted]] signing locked-out players.<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/article/1257553--nhl-lockout-players-launch-public-relations-offensive NHL lockout: players launch public relations offensive].

===Proposed realignment===
The relocation of the [[Atlanta Thrashers]] from the American southeast to the Canadian prairies, where the franchise is now known as the [[Winnipeg Jets]], in the summer of 2011 resulted in discussions within the league on how to realign the league's 30 teams. Following several months of speculation, the NHL's Board of Governors voted in favor of a radical realignment plan that would have reduced the six current divisions in two conferences into four conferences. The top four teams in each conference would then qualify for the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, while for the regular season, each team would face its non-conference opponents twice: once each at home and on the road. Conference opponents would face each other five or six times each. The plan was designed to better balance each grouping of teams by time zone, as well as to cut the costs of travel western teams face.<ref>{{cite news |last=Shoalts |first=David |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/nhl-governors-approve-four-conference-format/article2261147/ |title=NHL governors approve four-conference format |work=Globe and Mail |date=December 5, 2011 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>

However, on January 6, 2012, the league announced that the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) had rejected the proposed realignment, delaying any future changes until at least 2013–14.<ref>[http://www.wgrz.com/sports/article/149232/4/NHL-realignment-on-hold-after-union-balks NHL realignment on hold after union balks]. ''The Sports Network''. Retrieved 2012-01-06.</ref> NHLPA officers expressed a desire to see a draft schedule for the realignment, which the league had not completed.<ref>[http://www.hockeybuzz.com/blog.php?post_id=41111&blogger_id=1 NHL Alignment Will NOT Change as NHLPA Rejects Re-alignment. Here's why...]. ''Hockeybuzz.com''. Retrieved 2012-01-08.</ref>

The league and NHLPA then redesigned the plan, with the four conferences instead being reformed into four divisions within two conferences. Detroit and Columbus, the only two Western Conference teams in the Eastern Time Zone, were added to the Eastern Conference: Detroit moved into the current Atlantic Division and Columbus moved into the Metropolitan. The four groupings were designated as divisions, with the Eastern and Western Conference designations remaining in place. This results in all Eastern Conference teams existing entirely in the Eastern Time Zone. However, one of the Western Divisions will have all but one of the Pacific and Mountain time zone teams. That remaining Mountain time zone team is Colorado which will be with the other division centered around the Central time zone teams. On March 8, 2013, the NHLPA approved the league's realignment plan, with the league Board of Governors ratifying the realignment on March 14.<ref name="realignment" />

The four divisions have been organized as follows:<ref name="realignment">{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/nhl/story/_/id/9029028/nhlpa-consents-realignment-plan |title=NHLPA OK with realignment plan |publisher=ESPN |date=March 8, 2013 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref>

===Salary cap===
The NHL announced the revised salary cap on June 28, 2012. The salary cap figure is in effect until the end of the current [[collective bargaining agreement]] (CBA) with the Player's Association. The salary cap for players' salaries rose $5.9 million (USD) to $70.2 million per franchise. The salary floor, the minimum which franchises must spend rose to $54.2 million.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Vancouver Sun |author=Canadian Press |title=NHL's salary cap rises $5.9 million to $70.2 million  |date=June 28, 2012 |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/business/salary+rises+million+million/6855356/story.html |accessdate=2012-07-13}}</ref>

===Change of venue===
On October 24, 2012, the [[New York Islanders]] announced that the team had signed a 25-year lease with the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]], starting in 2015 after the team's current lease for the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] expires. The arena, originally constructed as the home for the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Brooklyn Nets]], will be expanded to meet NHL standards.<ref>{{cite web|title=New York Islanders following Nets to Brooklyn|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/nhl/story/_/id/8545550/islanders-following-nets-brooklyn|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2012-10-24}}</ref>

===Rule changes===
With the ratification of the new collective bargaining agreement, several rule changes took effect this season.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Bleacher Report |author=Nicholas Goss |title=Breaking Down the Rule Changes for the 2013 NHL Season |date=January 23, 2013 |url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1497718-breaking-down-the-rule-changes-for-the-2013-nhl-season |accessdate=2013-01-24 }}</ref>

*Officials no longer had to be certain that contact had been made with the hands (as opposed to the stick) in deciding whether or not to assess a [[Slashing (ice hockey)|slashing]] minor.
*Making contact with the opponent's facemask will result in a minor penalty.
*Both players facing-off are prohibited from batting the puck with their hand in an attempt to win the face-off. Any attempt by either center to win the face-off by batting the puck with their hand shall result in a minor penalty. This penalty shall be announced as a "Minor Penalty for Delay of Game - Face-off Violation."
*Rule 67 has been changed to prevent players from getting a faceoff by putting their glove on the puck anywhere on the ice and not allowing play to continue. A minor penalty will be assessed for "closing his hand on the puck."

===Uniforms===
*To celebrate 20 years in Dallas, the Stars wore special patches this season.
*The Tampa Bay Lightning wore special patches to commemorate their 20th season in the NHL. Their alternate uniform was also modified to include the simplified logo they introduced in the 2011-12 season. 
*The San Jose Sharks wore patches in memory of original owner [[George Gund III]], who died January 15, 2013. Gund was instrumental in bringing, removing and returning NHL hockey to the Bay Area.
*To celebrate 100 years of hockey on the west coast, the Canucks honored Vancouver's first professional hockey team, the Vancouver Millionaires, who played in the West Coast Hockey League from 1912-22 by wearing a patch of a re-colored Millionaires logo on their alternate home jerseys. The Canucks also wore throwback uniforms based on the 1915 [[Vancouver Millionaires]] in a game against the Detroit Red Wings.
*The Buffalo Sabres, Edmonton Oilers and Florida Panthers retired their third jerseys.

===European Premiere games===
In past seasons, selected NHL teams began their season with exhibition games and the first two regular season games in European cities. In March 2012, the NHL announced that it had decided not to start the season with games in Europe, because of the upcoming Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations and the surrounding uncertainty.<ref>{{cite news |work=CBC News |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2012/03/14/sp-nhl-europe-games-dropped.html |title=NHL cancels next year's games in Europe |date=March 14, 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}</ref>

With the NHL not playing games in Europe, Russia's [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (against which the NHL has played [[List of KHL vs NHL games|several interleague competitions]]) was instead to come to the United States, with the NHL's blessing; the KHL was to feature two games between [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] and [[SKA Saint Petersburg]] at the [[Barclays Center]] in [[Brooklyn]] on January 19 and 20, 2013.<ref>{{cite news |title=Brooklyn Nets arena will host KHL regular-season games, according to Medvedev|first=Dmitry|last=Chesnokov|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/brooklyn-nets-arena-host-khl-regular-season-games-152720866.html|work=Puck Daddy|date=March 12, 2012|accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref> However no agreement between the KHL and the Barclays Center had been signed, and the KHL announced the two games would be held in Russia; due to the NHL lockout, the signing of a 25-year lease with the New York Islanders, and pleas from the teams' fans to keep the games in Russia.<ref>Klein, Jeff Z.
