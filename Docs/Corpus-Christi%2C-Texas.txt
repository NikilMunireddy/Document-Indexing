'''Corpus Christi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɔr|p|ə|s|_|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|t|i}}) is a [[Gulf Coast of the United States|coastal]] city in the [[South Texas]] region of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]].  The [[county seat]] of [[Nueces County, Texas|Nueces County]],<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> it also extends into [[Aransas County, Texas|Aransas]], [[Kleberg County, Texas|Kleberg]], and [[San Patricio County, Texas|San Patricio]] Counties. The city's political boundaries encompass Nueces Bay and Corpus Christi Bay. Its zoned boundaries include small land parcels or water inlets of three neighboring counties.

The city's population was estimated to be 320,434 in 2014, making it the [[List of cities in Texas by population|eighth-most populous]] city in Texas. The [[Corpus Christi metropolitan area]] had an estimated population of 442,600.<ref name=boundarychanges>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/geographic/boundary_changes/index.html |title=US Census change list |publisher=Census.gov |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> The city is also the hub of the six-county Corpus Christi-Kingsville-Alice [[Combined Statistical Area]], with a 2013 estimated population of 516,793. The [[Port of Corpus Christi]] is the fifth-largest in the United States. The region is served by the [[Corpus Christi International Airport]].

The city's name (''Corpus Christi'') in [[Latin language|Latin]] means Body of [[Christ]]. The name was given to the settlement and surrounding bay by Spanish explorer [[Alonso Álvarez de Pineda]] in 1519, as he discovered the lush semitropical bay on the Catholic [[Corpus Christi (feast)|feast day of Corpus Christi]].  The city has been nicknamed "Texas Riviera" and "Sparkling City by the Sea", particularly featured in tourist literature.

==History==
[[File:Old map-Corpus Christi-1887.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Corpus Christi in 1887]]
{{Main|History of Corpus Christi, Texas}}

Corpus Christi was founded in 1839 by [[Colonel Henry Lawrence Kinney]] as Kinney's Trading Post, or Kinney's Ranch. It was a small trading post that sold supplies to a Mexican revolutionary army camped about {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=on}} west.<ref name="downtowncorpuschristi.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.downtowncorpuschristi.com/wiki/DMD/History |title=Corpus Christi, History, Historical, Interesting |publisher=Downtowncorpuschristi.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090318151134/http://downtowncorpuschristi.com:80/wiki/DMD/History |archivedate=March 18, 2009 }}</ref>
In July 1845, U.S. troops commanded by General [[Zachary Taylor]] set up camp there in preparation for [[Mexican-American War|war with Mexico]], where they remained until March 1846. About a year later, the settlement was named Corpus Christi and was incorporated on 9 September 1852.<ref name="cctexas.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.cctexas.com/?fuseaction=main.view&page=109 |title=Official web site for City of Corpus Christi, Texas |publisher=Cctexas.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Corpus Christi]] was fought between August 12 and August 18, 1862, during the [[American Civil War]]. [[United States Navy]] forces blockading Texas fought a small land and sea engagement with [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces in and around [[Corpus Christi Bay]] and bombarded the city. [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces defeated [[Confederate States Navy]] ships operating in the area, but were repulsed when they landed on the coast.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The [[Port of Corpus Christi]] was opened in 1926, and the Corpus Christi Naval Air Station was commissioned in 1941.<ref name="downtowncorpuschristi.com"/>

The [[1919 Florida Keys hurricane|1919 Storm]] devastated the city, killing hundreds on September 14. Only three structures survived the storm on North Beach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caller.com/columnists/murphy-givens/murphy-givens-storm-of-the-century-swept-across-north-beach-ep-358324482.html|title = MURPHY GIVENS: Storm of the century swept across North Beach}}</ref> To protect the city, the seawall was built. The city also suffered damage from [[Hurricane Celia]] in 1970 and [[Hurricane Allen]] in 1980, but little damage from [[Hurricane Ike]] in 2008.

===Civil rights===
*In November 1873, seven Mexican shepherds were lynched by a mob near the city. The crime was never solved.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Carrigan|first1=William D|last2=Webb|first2=Clive|title=When Americans Lynched Mexicans|accessdate=22 February 2015|publisher=The New York TImes|date=20 February 2015}}</ref>
*In February 1929, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC) was founded in Corpus Christi. This organization was created to battle racial discrimination against Hispanic people in the United States. Since its founding, LULAC has grown and now has a national headquarters in Washington, D.C.
*In March 1949, the [[American GI Forum]] (AGIF) was founded in Corpus Christi. Currently, AGIF focuses on veteran's issues, education, and civil rights issues. This organization was founded after concerns over the segregation of Mexican-American veterans from other veterans groups and the denial of medical services based on race by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]].
*''Cisneros v. [[Corpus Christi Independent School District]]'' (1970) was the first case to extend the U.S. Supreme Court's ''Brown v. the Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas'' decision (1954) to Mexican Americans. It recognized them as a minority group that could be and was frequently discriminated against. Such segregation and discrimination was ruled unconstitutional. Judge Woodrow Seals found that the school board consciously fostered a system that perpetuated traditional segregation. This included a system that bused Anglo students to schools out of their neighborhoods, renovated old schools in black and Mexican-American neighborhoods rather than building new ones, assigned black and Hispanic teachers to segregated schools, and limited hiring of such teachers at other schools; the school board also lacked a majority-to-minority busing system.<ref>{{cite news|title=CISNEROS V.

==Geology==

Corpus Christi is situated on [[fluvial]] deposits that are of [[Holocene]] - [[Pleistocene]] age. Although no solidified rock occurs naturally,<ref>texascoastgeology.com</ref> the Deweyville Formation of [[sand]], [[silt]], [[clay]], and [[gravel]], is locally indurated with [[calcium carbonate]] ([[caliche]]) deposits.

==Geography==

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Corpus Christi has a total area of 460.2 square miles (1,192.0&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which 154.6&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup> (400.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 33.60%) is land and 305.6&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup> (791.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 66.40%) is covered by water.  Drinking water for the city is supplied by two reservoirs, [[Lake Corpus Christi]], the [[Choke Canyon Reservoir]], and [[Lake Texana]]. Through an effective regional partnership with the [[Nueces River]] Authority and the Port of Corpus Christi Authority, a {{convert|101|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on}} pipeline was built which transports water from Lake Texana to the city's O.N. Stevens Water Treatment Plant. It was named the Mary Rhodes Pipeline, after the late mayor. A phase 2 of the pipeline is underway to draw water from the Colorado River.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mary Rhodes Pipeline Phase 2 Project Fact Sheet|url=http://www.engineercc.com/library/pdf/MaryRhodes_Pipeline_Ph2_FactSheet.pdf|accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> All reservoirs are outside the city limits, but Lake Corpus Christi and Choke Canyon Reservoir are managed directly by the public utility of the City of Corpus Christi. To support future water needs, plans are being completed to build a desalinization plant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texasdesal.com/news-updates/item/411-corpus-christi-moving-nearer-construction-of-desalination-plant.html|title=CORPUS CHRISTI MOVING NEARER CONSTRUCTION OF DESALINATION PLANT|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>

===Annexation===

Since its founding, the city has annexed nearby lands and waters for growth and development purposes. The original area encompassed several city blocks in current-day downtown Corpus Christi with the majority of city expansion occurring in the twentieth century.<ref>{{cite web|title=City Annexation Map|url=http://www.cctexas.com/Assets/Departments/Development-Services/Files/digital-maps/Annexation%20by%20decade.pdf|publisher=City of Corpus Christi|accessdate=2 January 2015}}</ref>

===Climate===

The city has a [[humid subtropical climate]], with hot summers and very short, mild winters. In the months from November through February the weather is the coolest. There is a noticeable warming trend in which March through April is fairly warm. The warmest part of the year in Corpus Christi is June through September with August being the peak of summer. October in the city is very pleasant while still warm but not as hot as the summer months. Corpus Christi is annually very windy, with wind speeds often reaching to {{convert|25|mph}} with gusts reaching more than {{convert|35|mph}}. The city's record high temperature is 109&nbsp;°F (43&nbsp;°C), on September 5, 2000. Average night-time winter lows in January, the coldest month, are a little less than 50&nbsp;°F (10&nbsp;°C) and its record low is 11&nbsp;°F (−12&nbsp;°C). In December 2004, the city experienced snowfall on Christmas Eve, the city's largest recorded snowstorm at {{convert|4.4|in|cm}}. The snow stayed until Christmas Day and melted the day after. Because of the uniqueness of the event, three separate books were made documenting the event, ''Snow'', ''More Snow'', and ''More Snow for Kids'', all with the theme of the South Texas Christmas miracle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texassnowbook.com/|title=Snow: The South Texas Christmas Miracle 2004}}</ref>

==Culture==
Various sections of Corpus Christi maintain distinct senses of identity and community from the city proper, especially the [[Calallen]] and [[Flour Bluff]] areas. Clarkwood and Annaville have a less prominent sense of identity, but the distinction remains. These areas are sometimes mistakenly believed to be separate municipalities.

The city has many demographic groups, ethnicities, and subcultures, each giving it a distinct flavor: the defense bases and the people who work there; the large Hispanic community; the oil related professionals and workers; the cowboy culture; and the surfers.

In 2015, Men's Health Magazine ranked Corpus Christi as the fattest city in the United States, renaming it "Corpulent Christi".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.menshealth.com/health/americas-10-fattest-and-leanest-cities|title=America's 10 Fattest (and Leanest) Cities|website=Men's Health|access-date=2016-04-03}}</ref> Obesity and Diabetes rank 2nd and 3rd in the nation, respectively, along with the fact that the city ranks extremely high in the lack of physical activity and the number of fast food restaurants.<ref name=":0" />

===Attractions===
The city is home to a number of popular destinations for both tourists and residents. The official visitor and tourism information organization is the Corpus Christi Convention and Visitors Bureau.

The [[Corpus Christi Botanical Gardens and Nature Center]], also located in the city, hosts gardening programs from time to time. On [[Oso Bay]] near the Pharaoh Valley subdivision is the [[Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge]]. The refuge is known for seabird-watching. The nearby Pharaohs golf course also serves as a haven for coastal and migratory birds.

Directly east of Corpus Christi are [[Padre Island]] and [[Mustang Island]], home to various municipal, state, and national parks, most notably the [[Padre Island National Seashore]]. The city is also near [[King Ranch]], one of the world's largest ranches, upon which the movie ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' was based.

The city also celebrates the annual Buccaneer Days Carnival, which is typically held downtown.

S. Padre Island Drive (locally abbreviated as "S.P.I.D.", with the letters pronounced individually), is the city's main retail corridor, with two shopping malls, [[La Palmera]] (formerly Padre Staples Mall), and [[Sunrise Mall (Corpus Christi, Texas)|Sunrise Mall]]. Also, a number of other large shopping centers, small strip centers, and restaurants can be found throughout the city.

Corpus Christi also is the home of Midget Ocean Racing Fleet, also known as MORF, which promotes sailing in the Coastal Bend. The Wednesday night races held by MORF are the longest-running weekly races in the United States.

Corpus Christi is served by [[Corpus Christi International Airport]] and [[Interstate 37 (Texas)|Interstate 37]]. [[Interstate 69E (Texas)|Interstate 69E]]/[[U.S. Highway 77 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 77]] connects the city to [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] and [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]]. [[Texas State Highway 44]] is a main thoroughfare that connects Corpus Christi to [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] and the western part of South Texas by way of [[Interstate 69W]]/[[U.S. Highway 59]], [[Interstate 35]], and [[U.S. Highway 83]]. The inner-city public transportation is provided by [[Corpus Christi Regional Transportation Authority]] with its 28 bus routes. Corpus Christi once had a [[streetcar]] system functioning from 1910 to 1931 and a railway station (passenger service ended in 1965). <!-- In the early 2000s, plans were made to reintroduce a trolley system back to downtown Corpus Christi, but any plans have since gone dead. --> Despite the convenience of a large harbor, the city does not have a passenger port. Plans to bring a cruise service are pending.

The city is accessed by two major bridges, the [[Corpus Christi Harbor Bridge|Harbor Bridge]] (US 181) and the [[John F Kennedy Memorial Causeway|John F. Kennedy Causeway]] (PR 22). Both bridges are maintained by the [[Texas Department of Transportation]].

Freight service from [[San Antonio]] to Corpus Christi is provided by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], but the original line, both freight and passenger, was the [[San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad]], which operated to Corpus Christi from 1913 to 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eqs12|title=Nancy Beck Young, "San Antonio, Uvalde and Gulf Railroad Company"|publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] on-line|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}</ref> Then the SAU&G, or "The Sausage", as it was commonly called, was merged into the [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]].
