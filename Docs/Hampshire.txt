'''Hampshire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|m|p|ʃ|ər}}, {{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-Hampshire.ogg|ˈ|h|æ|m|p|ʃ|ɪər}}; abbreviated '''Hants''', archaically known as the '''County of Southampton''') is a [[Counties of England|county]] on the southern coast of England in the United Kingdom. The [[county town]] of Hampshire is [[Winchester]], the former capital city of England. Hampshire is the most populous [[ceremonial county]] in the [[United Kingdom]] (excluding the [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]]) with almost half of the county's population living within the [[South Hampshire]] conurbation which includes the cities of [[Southampton]] and [[Portsmouth]].<ref name="BUA">{{cite web | url=http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/articles/747.aspx|title=2011 Census - Built-up areas| work= | publisher=[[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] | accessdate=8 August 2013}}</ref> The larger [[South Hampshire metropolitan area]] has a population of 1,547,000.<ref name=j>{{cite web|url=http://www.espon.eu/export/sites/default/Documents/Projects/ESPON2006Projects/StudiesScientificSupportProjects/UrbanFunctions/fr-1.4.3_April2007-final.pdf#page=119|title=British urban pattern: population data|accessdate=22 February 2010|date=March 2007|format=pdf|work=ESPON project 1.4.3 Study on Urban Functions|publisher=[[European Spatial Planning Observation Network]]|page=119}}</ref> Hampshire is notable for housing the birthplaces of the [[Royal Navy]], [[British Army]], and [[Royal Air Force]]. It is bordered by [[Dorset]] to the west, [[Wiltshire]] to the north-west, [[Berkshire]] to the north, [[Surrey]] to the north-east, and [[West Sussex]] to the east. The southern boundary is the coastline of the [[English Channel]] and the [[Solent]], facing the [[Isle of Wight]].

Hampshire is the largest county in [[South East England]] and remains the third largest [[shire county]] in the United Kingdom despite losing more land than any other English county in all contemporary boundary changes. At its greatest size in 1890, Hampshire was the fifth largest county in England. It now has an overall area of {{convert|3700|km2|sqmi}},<ref>[http://www.itisholdings.com/downloadfile.asp?id=72 ] {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.itisholdings.com/downloadfile.asp?id=72 |date=20141027142334 }}</ref> and measures about {{convert|86|km|mi}} east–west and {{convert|76|km|mi}} north–south.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantsmap/hantsmap/hscale.htm |title=map scales, handy facts, Hampshire |publisher=Geog.port.ac.uk |accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref>

Hampshire's tourist attractions include many seaside resorts and two [[National Parks in England and Wales|national parks]]: the [[New Forest National Park|New Forest]] and the [[South Downs National Park|South Downs]] (together covering some 45% of the county). Hampshire has a long maritime history and two of Europe's largest ports, Portsmouth and Southampton, lie on its coast. The county is famed as home of such writers as [[Jane Austen]] and [[Charles Dickens]], as well as the birthplace of engineer [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]].

==Etymology==
Hampshire takes its name from the settlement that is now the city of Southampton. Southampton was known in Old English as ''Hamtun'', roughly meaning "village-town", so its surrounding area or ''scīr'' became known as ''Hamtunscīr''. The old name was recorded in the [[Domesday book]] as ''Hantescire'', and it is from this spelling that the modern abbreviation "Hants" derives.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Hampshire|url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/abouthnt|publisher=Hampshire County Council|accessdate=3 April 2012}}</ref>  From 1889 until 1959, the [[administrative county]] was named the ''County of Southampton''<ref>{{cite web|title=County of Hants (Southampton)|url=http://histpop.org/ohpr/servlet/PageBrowser?path=Browse/Census%20%28by%20geography%29/England/1891&active=yes&mno=64&tocstate=expandnew&tocseq=2600&display=sections&display=tables&display=pagetitles&pageseq=first-nonblank|work=Census of England and Wales: 1891: Area, Houses and Population: Volume 1|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|accessdate=27 August 2012|page=121}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Local Government Act 1959: Section 59: Change of Name of County|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/41639/pages/1241|work=The London Gazette|accessdate=27 August 2012|page=1241|date=20 February 1959}}</ref> and has also been known as ''Southamptonshire''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vision of Britain|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp;jsessionid=831E0EE166940B068F901D2E5F5D2B33?text_id=929180&word=NULL|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=National Gazeteer|date=1868|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/HAM/Gaz1868.shtml|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>

==History==

===Prehistory until the Norman Conquest===
{{Main|History of Hampshire}}
The region is believed to have been continuously occupied since the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum|last Ice Age]] about 12,000 BCE.<ref>Oppenheimer, S, 2006, ''The Origins of the British''</ref> At this time Britain was still attached to the European continent and was predominantly covered with deciduous woodland. The first inhabitants came overland from Europe; these were anatomically and behaviourally modern humans, [[Mesolithic]] [[hunter-gatherers]]. Over several thousand years, the climate got progressively warmer, and sea levels rose; the English Channel, which started out as a river, was a major inlet by 8000 BCE, although Britain was still connected to Europe by a land bridge across the North Sea until 6500 BCE.<ref>Gaffney, V, Fitch, S, and Smith, D, 2009, ''Europe's Lost World: The rediscovery of Doggerland''</ref> Notable sites from this period include [[Bouldnor Cliff]].

[[Agriculture]] had arrived in southern Britain by 4000 BCE, and with it a [[neolithic]] culture. Some deforestation took place at that time, although it was during the [[Bronze Age]], beginning in 2200 BCE, that this became more widespread and systematic.<ref>Pryor, F, 2003, ''Britain BC''</ref> Hampshire has few monuments to show from these early periods, although nearby [[Stonehenge]] was built in several phases at some time between 3100 BCE and 2200 BCE. In the very late Bronze Age, fortified hilltop settlements known as [[hillforts]] began to appear in large numbers in many parts of Britain including Hampshire, and these became more and more important in the early and middle [[Iron Age]];<ref name="CunliffeIronAge">Cunliffe, B, 2008, ''Iron Age Communities in Britain'', fourth edition</ref> many of these are still visible in the landscape today and can be visited, notably [[Danebury|Danebury Rings]], the subject of a major study by archaeologist [[Barry Cunliffe]]. It is maintained that by this period the people of Britain predominantly spoke a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and their culture shared much in common with the [[Celts]] described by classical writers.<ref>Cunliffe, B, 1997, ''The Ancient Celts''</ref>

Hillforts largely declined in importance in the second half of the second century BCE, with many being abandoned. It was probably around this period that the first recorded invasion of Britain took place, as southern Britain was largely conquered by warrior-elites from [[Belgae|Belgic tribes]] of northeastern Gaul - whether these two events are linked to the decline of hillforts is unknown. By the Roman conquest, the [[oppidum]] at [[Venta Belgarum|Venta]], modern-day Winchester, was the de facto regional administrative centre; Winchester was however of secondary importance to the Roman-style town of [[Calleva]], modern [[Silchester]], built further north by a dominant Belgic polity known as the [[Atrebates]] in the 50s BCE. Julius Caesar invaded southeastern England briefly in 55 and again in 54 BCE, but he never reached Hampshire. Notable sites from this period include [[Hengistbury Head]] (now technically in Dorset), which was a major port.<ref name="CunliffeIronAge" /><ref>Pryor, F, 2004, ''Britain BC''</ref> There is a "Museum of the Iron Age" in Andover.

The Romans invaded Britain again in 43 CE, and Hampshire was incorporated into the Roman province of Britannia very quickly. It is generally believed their political leaders allowed themselves to be incorporated peacefully. Venta became the capital of the administrative polity of the Belgae, which included most of Hampshire and Wiltshire and reached as far as Bath. It is not recorded whether the people of Hampshire played any role in Boudicca's rebellion of 60-61 CE, but there is evidence of burning in Winchester dated to around this period.<ref>Cunliffe, B, 1991, ''Wessex to AD 1000'', p.218</ref> For most of the next three centuries, southern Britain enjoyed relative peace. The later part of the Roman period saw most towns build defensive walls; a pottery industry based in the New Forest was exported widely across southern Britain. There was a fortification near Southampton called [[Clausentum]], part of the [[Saxon Shore]] forts, traditionally seen as defences against maritime raids by Germanic tribes. The Romans officially withdrew from Britain in 410 CE.<ref name="CunliffeWessex">Cunliffe, B, 1991, ''Wessex to AD 1000''</ref><ref>de la Bedoyere, Guy, 2006, ''Roman Britain: A New History''</ref><ref name="Pryor">Pryor, F, 2004, ''Britain AD''</ref>

Records are unreliable for the next two hundred years, but in this time southern Britain went from being [[Britons (Celtic people)|Brythonic]] to being [[English people|English]] and Hampshire emerged as the centre of what was to become the most powerful kingdom in Britain, the [[Kingdom of Wessex]]. Evidence of early Anglo-Saxon settlement has been found at Clausentum and on the Thames at Dorchester, dated to the fifth century, and by the seventh century, the population of Hampshire was predominantly English-speaking. It is also around this period that the administrative region of "Hampshire" seems to appear; the name is attested as "Hamtunscir" in 755,<ref name='grant'>{{cite book | last = Grant | first = Russell | authorlink = Russell Grant | title = The Real Counties of Britain | publisher=Lennard Publishing | year = 1989 | location = Oxford | page = 61 | url = | id = | isbn = 1-85291-071-2 }}</ref> and Albany Major suggested that the traditional western and northern borders of Hampshire may even go back to the very earliest conquests of [[Cerdic]], legendary founder of Wessex, at the very beginning of the sixth century.<ref>Major, Albany F ''Early Wars of Wessex'' (1912, 1978) p.17</ref> Wessex gradually expanded westwards into Brythonic [[Dorset]] and [[Somerset]] in the seventh century. A statue in Winchester celebrates the powerful [[King Alfred]], who repulsed the Vikings and stabilised the region in the 9th century. He was also a great scholar, who commissioned the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a powerful tool in the development of the English identity. King Alfred proclaimed himself "King of England" in 886; but it was not until 927 that [[Athelstan]] of Wessex officially controlled the whole of England.<ref name="CunliffeWessex" /><ref name="Pryor" /><ref>Hinley, G, 2006, ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons''</ref><ref>Fleming, R, 2010, ''Britain After Rome: The Fall and Rise 400 to 1070''</ref>

===Middle Ages onwards===

By the Norman conquest, London had overtaken Winchester as the largest city in England, thanks in part to Alfred the Great's investments in infrastructure, and after the Norman Conquest [[William the Conqueror|King William I]] made it his capital. The centre of political power moved away from Hampshire, although Winchester remained a city of importance: it was the proximity of the [[New Forest]] to Winchester that made it such a prized royal hunting forest; indeed [[King William Rufus]] was famously killed in suspicious circumstances while hunting there. The county was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] divided into 44 [[hundred (division)|hundred]]s. From the 12th century the ports grew in importance, fuelled by trade with the continent, wool and cloth manufacture in the county, and the fishing industry, and a shipbuilding industry was established. By 1523 at the latest, the population of Southampton had outstripped that of Winchester.

Over several centuries a series of [[castle]]s and [[fort]]s were constructed along the coast of the [[Solent]] to defend the harbours at Southampton and Portsmouth. These include the Roman [[Portchester Castle]] which overlooks [[Portsmouth Harbour]], and a series of forts built by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] including [[Hurst Castle]], situated on a sand [[spit (landform)|spit]] at the mouth of the Solent, [[Calshot Castle]] on another spit at the mouth of Southampton Water, and [[Netley Castle]]. Southampton and Portsmouth remained important harbours when rivals, such as [[Poole]] and [[Bristol]] declined, as they are amongst the few locations that combine shelter with deep water. Southampton has been host to many famous ships, including the ''[[Mayflower]]'' and the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', the latter being staffed largely by natives of Southampton.

Hampshire played a crucial role in the Second World War due to the large [[Royal Navy]] [[HMNB Portsmouth|naval base]] at Portsmouth, the army camp at [[Aldershot]] and the military [[Netley Hospital]] on Southampton Water, as well as its proximity to the army training ranges on [[Salisbury Plain]] and the [[Isle of Purbeck]]. [[Supermarine]], the designers of the [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and other military aircraft, were based in Southampton, which led to severe bombing of the city. Aldershot remains one of the [[British Army]]'s main permanent camps. [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]] is a major centre for the Aviation industry.

Although the [[Isle of Wight]] has at times been part of Hampshire, it has been administratively independent for over a century, obtaining a [[county council]] of its own in 1890. The Isle of Wight became a full [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] in 1974. Apart from a shared [[Hampshire Constabulary|police force]] there are now no formal administrative links between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire, though many organisations still combine Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

The towns of [[Bournemouth]] and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]] also fall within the traditional county of Hampshire, but were transferred to [[Dorset]] in the local government reorganisation of 1974.  The boundary was changed again in 1992, when [[South Tidworth]] was transferred to Wiltshire.

The City Museum in Winchester covers the Iron Age and Roman periods, the Middle Ages, and the Victorian period over three floors.

===United States===
Hampshire was the departure point of some of those later to settle on the east coast of what is now the United States, in the 17th century, giving its name in particular to the state of [[New Hampshire]]. The counties of [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight]] and [[Southampton County, Virginia|Southampton]] in Virginia reflect the origins of some of the earliest Jamestown settlers. Portsmouth VA, appropriately enough, is home to one of the US Navy's main dockyards, the Norfolk (formerly Gosport) Naval Yard.<ref>Isle of Wight Historical Review ''[http://web.ukonline.co.uk/lordcornell/iwhr/va/iwplant.htm Isle of Wight Plantation].'' {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/lordcornell/iwhr/va/iwplant.htm |date=20100111053734 }}</ref>
[[File:NetleyRVCP-North.jpg|thumb|200px|Southampton from Netley Hospital]]

==Governance==
With the exceptions of the [[unitary authorities]] of Portsmouth and Southampton, Hampshire is governed by [[Hampshire County Council]] based in Winchester, with several [[non-metropolitan district]]s beneath it, and for the majority of the county, [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]] or [[town council]]s at the local level. The districts of Hampshire are the following:
*[[Basingstoke and Deane]]
*[[City of Winchester]]
*[[East Hampshire]]
*[[Eastleigh (borough)|Eastleigh]]
*[[Fareham (borough)|Fareham]]
*[[Gosport]]
*[[Hart, Hampshire|Hart]]
*[[Havant (borough)|Havant]]
*[[New Forest (district)|New Forest]]
*[[City of Portsmouth]] (unitary)
*[[Rushmoor]]
*[[City of Southampton]] (unitary)
*[[Test Valley]]
The county also contains two [[national park]]s; the first covering the [[New Forest]], and therefore governance of this area is carried out by a [[national park authority]] as well as the New Forest District Council, the second the newer national park for the [[South Downs]] which covers the chalk downlands from Winchester eastwards which embraces a large number of local council areas across three counties, Hampshire, West and East Sussex.

==Economy==
{{update|section|date=March 2015}}
[[File:050103 2300 hants bh.jpg|thumb|200px|The Beaulieu River]]

Hampshire is one of the most affluent counties in the country, with a Gross domestic product (GDP) of [[Pound Sterling|£]]32.3&nbsp;billion in 2005 (£22.4&nbsp;billion when excluding Southampton and Portsmouth).<ref>Hampshire County Council, 2008. ''[http://www3.hants.gov.uk/business/economic_data/economy/state-figures.htm Summary figures – State of the economy].''</ref> In 2006, Hampshire had a GDP per capita of £19,300, comparable with the UK as a whole and slightly below the South East England figure of £19,600.<ref>Hampshire County Council, 2008. ''[http://www3.hants.gov.uk/business/economic_data/economy/state-performance.htm Economic performance – State of the economy].''</ref>

Portsmouth and Winchester have the biggest job densities in the whole county, and therefore there is a high level of commuting into the cities from towns such as Hook, or even Micheldever. Southampton has the highest number of total jobs and commuting both into and out of the city is high. The county has a lower level of [[unemployment rate|unemployment]] than the national average, at 1.9% when the national rate was 3.3%, and as of March 2005 has fallen to 1.1%. 39% are employed by large firms, compared with a national average of 42%. Hampshire has a considerably higher than national average employment in high-tech industries, but average levels in knowledge-based industry. 25.21% of the population work in the [[public sector]].<ref>Hampshire County Council, 2004. ''[http://www.hants.gov.uk/factsandfigures/profileofhampshire-index.html Profile of Hampshire].''</ref>

Many rural areas of Hampshire have traditionally been reliant on agriculture, particularly [[dairy farming]], although the significance of agriculture as a rural employer and rural wealth creator has declined since the first half of the 20th century and agriculture currently employs 1.32% of the rural population.

The [[New Forest]] area is a [[National Parks of England and Wales|National Park]], and tourism is a significant economic segment in this area, with 7.5&nbsp;million visitors in 1992.<ref>New Forest District Council, n.d. "[http://www.thenewforest.co.uk/moreinfo/students/students_.htm Tourism questions and answers]."</ref> The [[South Downs]] and the cities of Portsmouth, Southampton and Winchester also attract tourists to the county. [[Southampton Boat Show]] is one of the biggest annual events held in the county, and attracts visitors from throughout the country. In 2003 the county had a total of 31&nbsp;million day visits, and 4.2&nbsp;million longer stays.<ref>Hampshire County Council, United Kingdom Tourism Survey & GB Leisure Day Visits Survey, 2004. "[http://www.hants.gov.uk/rh/tourism/facts.html Tourism Facts and Figures]."</ref>

The urban cities of Southampton and Portsmouth are both significant urban ports, with Southampton handling a large proportion of the national container freight and Portsmouth housing a large Royal Navy base. The maritime docks have traditionally been large employers in these maritime-urban cities, though again mechanisation has forced diversification of the urban-maritime economy.

==Demographics==
[[File:Soton river test docks 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Southampton Docks]]
At the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|Census 2001]]<ref>[[Office for National Statistics]] & Hampshire County Council, 2003. [http://www.hants.gov.uk/census/ Census 2001 data]</ref> the ceremonial county recorded a population of 1,644,249, of which 1,240,103 were in the administrative county, 217,445 were in the [[unitary authority]] of Southampton, and 186,701 were in Portsmouth. The population of the administrative county grew 5.6% from the 1991 census, Southampton grew 6.2% while Portsmouth remained unchanged, compared with 2.6% for England and Wales as a whole. Eastleigh and Winchester grew fastest at 9% each.

96.73% of residents were white British, falling to 92.37% in Southampton. The significant ethnic minorities are Asian at 1.34% and mixed race at 0.84%. 0.75% of residents were migrants from outside the UK. 73.86% stated their religion as Christianity and 16.86% were not religious. Significant minority religions were Islam (0.76%) and [[Hinduism]] (0.33%).

The county has a high level of car ownership, with only 15.7% having no access to a private car compared with 26.8% for England and Wales. The county has a lower than average use of trains (3.2% compared with 4.1% for commuting) and buses (3.2% to 7.4%) but a higher than average use of bicycles (3.5% to 2.7%) and cars (63.5% to 55.3%).<ref>Hampshire County Council, 2005. [http://www.hants.gov.uk/factsandfigures/ Facts and Figures website].</ref>

The table below shows the population change up to the 2011 census, contrasting the previous census.  It also shows the proportion of residents in each district reliant upon lowest income and/or joblessness benefits, the national average proportion of which was 4.5% as at August 2012, the year for which latest datasets have been published.  It can be seen that the most populous district of Hampshire is [[New Forest District]] containing many villages and the towns of [[Fawley, Hampshire|Fawley]], [[Hythe and Dibden]], [[Lymington]], [[Lyndhurst, Hampshire|Lyndhurst]], [[Milford-on-Sea]], [[New Milton]], [[Ringwood]] and [[Totton and Eling]].

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Hampshire|List of further education colleges in Hampshire}}
The school system in Hampshire (including Southampton and Portsmouth) is comprehensive. Geographically inside the Hampshire [[Local Education Authority|LEA]] are twenty four independent schools, Southampton has three and Portsmouth has four. Few Hampshire schools have sixth forms, which varies by district council. There are 14 further education colleges within the Hampshire LEA, including 6 graded as 'outstanding' by [[Ofsted]]: [[Alton College]], [[Brockenhurst College]], [[Farnborough College of Technology]], [[Farnborough Sixth Form College]], [[Peter Symonds College]], [[Queen Mary's College]], and [[South downs college|South Downs College]]

There are four universities, namely the [[University of Southampton]], [[Southampton Solent University]], the [[University of Portsmouth]] and the [[University of Winchester]] (which also had a small campus in [[Basingstoke]] until 2011). Farnborough College of Technology awards [[University of Surrey]]-accredited degrees.

==Politics==
Hampshire is divided into eighteen [[List of Parliamentary constituencies in Hampshire|parliamentary constituencies]]. in 2010 fourteen of these were represented by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Members of Parliament (MPs), two by the [[Liberal Democrats]] and two by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. Labour represented the largest urban centre, holding both Southampton constituencies ([[Southampton Test (UK Parliament constituency)|Test]] and [[Southampton Itchen|Itchen]]). The Liberal Democrats held [[Portsmouth South (UK Parliament constituency)|Portsmouth South]] and [[Eastleigh (UK Parliament constituency)|Eastleigh]]. In the 2015 general election every Hampshire seat except Southampton Test (Labour) was won by the Conservatives.

The Conservatives represent a mix of rural and urban areas: [[Aldershot (UK Parliament constituency)|Aldershot]], [[Basingstoke (UK Parliament constituency)|Basingstoke]], [[East Hampshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Hampshire]], [[Fareham (UK Parliament constituency)|Fareham]], [[Gosport (UK Parliament constituency)|Gosport]], [[Havant (UK Parliament constituency)|Havant]], [[Meon Valley (UK Parliament constituency)|Meon Valley]], [[North East Hampshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Hampshire]], [[North West Hampshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North West Hampshire]], [[New Forest East (UK Parliament constituency)|New Forest East]], [[New Forest West (UK Parliament constituency)|New Forest West]], [[Portsmouth North (UK Parliament constituency)|Portsmouth North]], [[Romsey and Southampton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Romsey and Southampton North]] and [[Winchester (UK Parliament constituency)|Winchester]].

At the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2013|2013 local elections]] for Hampshire County Council, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] had a 37.51% share of the votes, the [[Liberal Democrats]] had 21.71%, the [[UK Independence Party]] had 24.61% and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] 10%. As a result, 45 Conservatives, 17 Liberal Democrats, 10 UKIP, four Labour and one Community Campaign councillor sit on the County Council.<ref>Hampshire County Council, 2013. [http://election.hants.gov.uk/hwstate.aspx?id=175&year=2013].</ref> [[Southampton City Council]], which is a separate Unitary Authority, has 28 Labour, 16 Conservative, 2 Councillors Against the Cuts and 2 Liberal Democrat councillors.<ref>Southampton City Council, 2013. [http://www.southampton.gov.uk/council-partners/councillorsrepresent/].</ref> [[Portsmouth City Council]], also a UA, has 25 Liberal Democrat, 12 Conservative and 5 Labour councillors.<ref>Portsmouth City Council, 2013. [http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/yourcouncil/1120.html].</ref>

Hampshire also has its own County Youth Council (HCYC)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hcycweb.net/ |title=Hampshire County Youth Council |publisher=Hcycweb.net |date=22 April 2009 |accessdate=3 May 2009}}</ref> and is an independent youth-run organisation. It meets once a month around Hampshire and aims to give the young people of Hampshire a voice. It also has numerous district and borough youth councils including Basingstoke's "Basingstoke & Deane Youth Council".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bdycweb.net/ |title=Basingstoke & Deane Youth Council |publisher=Bdycweb.net |accessdate=3 May 2009}}</ref> Along with the Youth council for the Test Valley District, youthExpress.

==Wildlife==
Hampshire has wildlife typical of the island of Great Britain. The River Test has a growing number of otters, although other areas of the county have quite low numbers. There are reports of [[wild boar]] across the county. The [[New Forest]] is known for its ponies, which have free rein over much of the area. One distinguishing feature is that Hampshire has a large free roaming herd of [[red deer]], including more than 6,500 stags during busy seasons. The stag population is managed by the government and hunting is carefully regulated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Forestry Commission: New Forest Fact File|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/Hunting.pdf/$file/Hunting.pdf|accessdate=8 September 2014}}</ref>

===Geology and climate===
{{Main|Geology of Hampshire}}
Hampshire's geology falls into two categories. In the south, along the coast is the "[[Hampshire Basin]]", an area of relatively [[resistance (geology)|non-resistant]] [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]] [[clay]]s and [[gravel]]s which are protected from sea [[erosion]] by the [[Isle of Purbeck]], Dorset, and the [[Isle of Wight]]. These low, flat lands support [[heathland]] and [[woodland]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], a large area of which forms part of the [[New Forest]]. The New Forest has a mosaic of heathland, grassland, coniferous and deciduous woodland habitats that host [[biodiversity|diverse wildlife]]. The forest is protected as a [[National parks of England and Wales|national park]], limiting development and agricultural use to protect the landscape and wildlife. Large areas of the New Forest are open common lands kept as a grassland [[plagioclimax]] by grazing animals, including domesticated cattle, pigs and horses, and several wild deer species. Erosion of the weak rock and sea level change flooding the low land has carved several large [[Estuary|estuaries]] and [[ria]]s, notably the {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} long<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mollus.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/40/5/413 |title=THE INTERTIDAL LAMELLIBRANCHS OF SOUTHAMPTON WATER, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO CERASTODERMA EDULE AND C. GLAUCUM – BARNES 40 (5): 413 – Journal of Molluscan Studies |publisher=Mollus.oxfordjournals.org |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}</ref> [[Southampton Water]] and the large convoluted [[Portsmouth Harbour]]. The Isle of Wight lies off the coast of Hampshire where the non-resistant rock has been eroded away, forming the [[Solent]].

In the north and centre of the county the substrate is the rocks of the [[Chalk Group]], which form the [[Hampshire Downs]] and the [[South Downs]]. These are high hills with steep slopes where they border the clays to the south. The hills dip steeply forming a [[Escarpment|scarp]] onto the [[River Thames|Thames valley]] to the north, and dip gently to the south. The highest point in the county is [[Pilot Hill]], which reaches a height of 286&nbsp;m (938&nbsp;ft), and lies on the border with [[West Berkshire]]. [[Butser Hill]] near [[Petersfield]] is the second highest point at 271 metres (889&nbsp;ft) and lies in the [[South Downs National Park]]. The highest village in Hampshire at between 235-240m above sea level is [[Ashmansworth]],<ref>[[Ordnance Survey]]. ''[http://www.streetmap.co.uk/idld.srf?X=441552&Y=157395&A=Y&Z=115&lm=1 Streetmap/OS map showing height of Ashmansworth]''.</ref> located between [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]] and [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]].  The [[downland]] supports a [[calcareous grassland]] habitat, important for wild flowers and insects. A large area of the downs is now protected from further agricultural damage by the East Hampshire [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]]. The [[River Itchen, Hampshire|Itchen]] and [[River Test|Test]] are [[trout]] rivers that flow from the chalk through wooded valleys into Southampton Water. Nestled in a valley on the downs is [[Selborne]], and the countryside surrounding the village was the location of [[Gilbert White]]'s pioneering observations on [[natural history]]. Hampshire's [[county flower]] is the [[Dog Rose]].<ref>[[BBC News]], 5 May 2004. ''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3684291.stm UK counties choose floral emblems]''.</ref>

==Cities, towns and villages==
[[File:Uk-basingstoke.jpg|thumb|200px|New apartment blocks in the rapidly changing Basingstoke]]
Hampshire's [[county town]] is Winchester, a historic city that was once the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Wessex]] and of England until the [[Norman conquest of England]]. The port cities of Southampton and Portsmouth were split off as independent [[unitary authorities]] in 1997, although they are still included in Hampshire for ceremonial purposes. [[Fareham]], [[Gosport]] and [[Havant]] have grown into a [[conurbation]] that stretches along the coast between the two main cities. The three cities are all university cities, Southampton being home to the [[University of Southampton]] and [[Southampton Solent University]] (formerly Southampton Institute), Portsmouth to the [[University of Portsmouth]], and Winchester to the [[University of Winchester]] (formerly known as University College Winchester; King Alfred's College).The northeast of the county houses the [[Aldershot Urban Area|Blackwater Valley]] conurbation, which includes the towns of [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], [[Aldershot]], [[Blackwater, Hampshire|Blackwater]] and [[Yateley]] and borders both [[Berkshire]] and Surrey.

Hampshire lies outside the [[green belt]] area of restricted development around London, but has good railway and motorway links to the capital, and in common with the rest of the south-east has seen the growth of [[dormitory town]]s since the 1960s. [[Basingstoke]], in the northern part of the county, has grown from a country town into a business and financial centre. Aldershot, [[Portsmouth]], and Farnborough have strong military associations with the [[British Army|Army]], Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force respectively. The county also includes several [[market town]]s: [[Alton, Hampshire|Alton]], [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], [[Bishop's Waltham]], [[Lymington]], [[New Milton]], [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]], [[Ringwood]], [[Romsey]] and [[Whitchurch, Hampshire|Whitchurch]].

Due to Hampshire's long association with pigs and boars, natives of the county have been known as ''Hampshire hogs'' since the 18th century.<ref name=hog>Hampshire County Council, 2003. "[http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2003/pr558hog.html Press Release: Hampshire's Hog has a home]."</ref> Hampshire has [[literature|literary]] connections, being the birthplace of authors including [[Jane Austen]], and [[Charles Dickens]], and the residence of others, such as [[Charles Kingsley]]. Austen lived most of her life in Hampshire, where her father was rector of [[Steventon, Hampshire]], and wrote all of her novels in the county. Hampshire also has many [[visual art]] connections, claiming the painter [[John Everett Millais]] as a native, and the cities and countryside have been the subject of paintings by [[L. S. Lowry]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. [[Selborne]] was the home of [[Gilbert White]]; his house is now a museum, which also includes The Oates Collection, dedicated to the explorer [[Lawrence Oates]].

The game of [[cricket]] was largely developed in south-east England, with one of the first teams forming at [[Hambledon, Hampshire|Hambledon]] in 1750, with the [[Hambledon Club]] creating many of cricket's early rules. [[Hampshire County Cricket Club]] today is a successful [[first-class cricket|first-class]] team, captained by [[James Adams (cricketer, born 1980)|James Adams]]. The main county ground is the [[Rose Bowl, Hampshire|Rose Bowl]] in [[West End, Hampshire|West End]], which has hosted several [[One Day International|one day internationals]] and which, following redevelopment, hosted its first [[Test cricket|test match]] in 2011. Hampshire have also been captained by former [[Australia national cricket team|Australian]] leg-spinner [[Shane Warne]].

Hampshire's relatively safe waters have allowed the county to develop as one of the busiest sailing areas in the country, with many [[yacht]] clubs and several manufacturers on the Solent. The sport of [[windsurfing]] was invented at [[Hayling Island]], which is to the south east of the county.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://slcc.strath.ac.uk/scotslawcourse/ip/ip/patent/windsurf.html |title=Windsurfing International Inc. v Tabur Marine (GB) Ltd.

Hampshire has several association football teams, including [[Premier League]] side [[Southampton F.C.]], [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Portsmouth F.C.]] and [[Conference Premier]] sides [[Aldershot Town F.C.]] and [[Eastleigh F.C.]], . Portsmouth F.C. and Southampton F.C. have traditionally been fierce rivals. Portsmouth won the [[FA Cup]] in 1939 and 2008 and [[Football League]] title twice, in 1949 and 1950, but have spent much of the last 50&nbsp;years outside the top division, including three seasons in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], which they are currently competing in (the lowest division in senior football). Southampton, meanwhile, won the FA Cup in 1976, reached 3 other finals (1900, 1902, and 2003) and spent 27 unbroken years in England's top division between 1978 and 2005. [[Aldershot F.C.]] became members of the Football League in 1932 but never progressed beyond the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]], and on 25 March 1992 went into liquidation and were forced to resign from the league. A new football club, Aldershot Town F.C. was formed almost immediately, and started life in Division 3 of the [[Isthmian League]]. In 2008 Aldershot Town were crowned the [[Conference Premier]] champions and were promoted into the Football League, however they lost their Football League status after the 2012–13 season which saw them finish bottom of the football league.

Hampshire also has a number of [[Non-League football|Non League]] football teams. [[Basingstoke Town F.C.|Basingstoke Town]], [[Farnborough F.C.|Farnborough]] and [[Havant & Waterlooville F.C.|Havant & Waterlooville]] play in the [[Conference South]]. [[Bashley F.C.|Bashley]] Gosport and AFC Totton play in the [[Southern Football League Premier Division]] and [[Sholing F.C.]] and [[Winchester City F.C.]] play in the [[Southern Football League]] Division One South and West.

[[Thruxton Circuit]], in the north of the county, is Hampshire's premier motor racing circuit. The [[National Motor Museum, Beaulieu|National Motor Museum]] is located in the [[New Forest]] adjacent to [[Beaulieu, Hampshire|Beaulieu Palace House]].

The [[Farnborough Airshow]] is a popular international event, held biennially.

The county's news is covered on [[BBC]] TV by [[BBC South Today]] from its studios in [[Southampton]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] news covers the county as part of [[Meridian Broadcasting|ITV Meridian]], though both [[BBC London]] and [[ITV London]] can be received in northern and eastern parts of the county. Countless commercial radio stations cover the area, and [[BBC Radio Solent]] looks after the majority of the county, while [[BBC Surrey]] can be heard in the north east. University journalism students also broadcast bulletins for local areas – such as Winol in Winchester.{{CN|date=April 2016}}

Southampton and Portsmouth support daily newspapers; the ''[[Southern Daily Echo]]'' and ''[[The News (Portsmouth)|Portsmouth News]]''. The ''[[Basingstoke Gazette]]'' is published three times a week, and there are a number of other papers that publish on a weekly basis.

==Transport==
[[Southampton Airport]], with an accompanying main line [[Southampton Airport (Parkway) railway station|railway station]], is an international airport situated in the [[Eastleigh (borough)|Borough of Eastleigh]], close to [[Swaythling]] in the city of [[Southampton]]. Cross-[[English Channel|channel]] and cross-[[Solent]] ferries link the county to the Isle of Wight, the Channel Islands and continental Europe. The [[South Western Main Line]] (operated by South West Trains) railway from London to [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] runs through Winchester and Southampton, and the [[Wessex Main Line]] from [[Bristol]] to Portsmouth also runs through the county as does the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]].

The [[M3 motorway (Great Britain)|M3 motorway]] connects the county to London. The construction of the [[Twyford Down]] cutting near Winchester caused major controversy by cutting through a series of ancient trackways (the Dongas) and other features of archaeological significance. The [[M27 motorway]] serves a bypass for the major conurbations and as a link to other settlements on the south coast. Other important roads include the [[A3 road|A3]], [[A31 road|A31]], [[A34 road|A34]], [[A36 road|A36]] and [[A303 road|A303]].

Hampshire formerly had several canals, but most of these have been abandoned and their routes built over. The [[Basingstoke Canal]] has been extensively restored, and is now navigable for most of its route, but the [[Salisbury and Southampton Canal]], [[Andover Canal]] and [[Portsmouth and Arundel Canal]] have all disappeared. Restoration of the [[Itchen Navigation]], linking Southampton and Winchester, primarily as a wildlife corridor, began in 2008.
