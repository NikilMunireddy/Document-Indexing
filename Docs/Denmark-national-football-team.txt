The '''Denmark national football team''' ({{lang-da|Danmarks fodboldlandshold}}) represents [[Denmark]] in association football and is controlled by the [[Danish Football Association]] (DBU), the governing body for the football clubs which are organized under DBU. Denmark's home ground is Telia Parken in the Østerbro district of Copenhagen, and their head coach is [[Åge Hareide]].

Denmark were the winners of the [[Football at the 1906 Intercalated Games]] and silver medalists at the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympics]]. However, as amateurs who prohibited their internationals from becoming professionals at foreign clubs, Denmark did not qualify for the World Cup until [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], although they won another Olympic silver in [[Football at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]].

Since 1983, the team has continuously been visible as a solidly competitive side, with the triumph in the [[1992 European Football Championship|1992 European Championships]] in Sweden as its most prominent victory, beating the European champions from [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the semifinal, and the World champions from [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the final. They also managed to win the [[1995 FIFA Confederations Cup|1995 Confederations Cup]], defeating [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the final. Their best [[FIFA World Cup]] result was achieved in 1998, where they narrowly lost 3–2 in a quarter-final against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].

==Teams==
Apart from the men's senior A-level team, Denmark competes with a [[Denmark women's national football team|women's national team]], and has teams at various youth levels for both men and women, most prominently the [[Denmark national under-21 football team|U21 national team]]. Historically, the A-level team competed in the [[Summer Olympics|Olympics]] until and including the 1988 tournament, whereafter Olympic games count as U21 national games. In addition to the A-level team and youth teams, Denmark also have a special league national team named [[Denmark League XI national football team|Ligalandsholdet]], with the best Danish footballers from the Nordic leagues. Ligalandsholdet was created in January 1983, and has ever since (except in 2005 and 2011), each year played some unofficial games for the national team, during the winter break of the Nordic leagues. Sometimes the media also refer to Ligalandsholdet as Denmark's B-team, as the best Danish footballers selected for the A-team often play in leagues outside of the Nordic countries. As such, the national team coach also at several times, outlined the purpose of having unofficial matches played by Ligalandsholdet, to be an opportunity of testing new potential upcoming Danish players for the A-team.

==History==

===Amateur years===
[[File:DK football1908.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Danish team that won their first Silver Medal at the [[1908 Summer Olympics]].]]
[[File:Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics - Denmark squad.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Danish team, winning the Silver medals at the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympics]].]]

The first three editions of the Olympic football event in 1900–1906 had an unofficial status, as the event was not yet open for national football teams to compete, and only had limited participation of three or four club teams from a few nations. Denmark had no club team invited in the [[Football at the 1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Olympics]] and the [[Football at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]], but then received a special invitation for the [[Football at the 1906 Summer Olympics|1906 Olympics]], to compete against 1 Greek club team ([[Athens]]) and 2 club teams from the Ottoman Empire ([[İzmir|Smyrna]] and [[Thessaloniki]]). The team to represent Denmark was compiled of players from the [[Copenhagen Football Association]] (KBU), and they managed to win the event, and thereby an unofficial gold medal. Two years later, in the first official football tournament at the [[Football at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics]], Denmark won a silver medal. At the next [[Football at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympics]] the team again managed to win a silver medal, which was followed by a golden era from April 1914 until April 1920, with Denmark ranked most of the time as number one in the world by the [[World Football Elo Ratings|elo ranking]].

Although Denmark figured fairly prominently in the pre-[[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] era, international success would elude them for years from the first World Cup in 1930 and forward. Despite the country's ability to produce outstanding football talents, [[Danish Football Association|DBU]] only had ambition (or economy) to let the national team play friendly matches and the regional tournament [[Nordic Football Championship|Nordic Championship]], during the time from October 1920 until June 1948. When DBU decided to set their sights higher, they allowed the national team to start contesting the Olympics again, this promptly resulted in a bronze medal at the [[Football at the 1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympics]]. After the team only reached the quarter-final at the [[Football at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]], DBU however decided not to contest the next [[Association football at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympics]]. As football remained an amateur pastime, most of the best Danish footballers moved abroad to make a living,<ref name="history">{{cite web|title=Danish Football|url=http://www.ambtallinn.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/5D568E99-F599-440C-8B01-0057FC717638/0/fodbold_engelsk_2003.pdf|author=Birger B. Peitersen|publisher=Royal Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with Danmark's Nationalleksikon|year=2003}}</ref> and due to DBU enforcing the rule to bar all professionals from the national team, it started to become difficult to assemble a highly competitive team.

Denmark experienced their next revival at the [[Football at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympics]], with a third set of Olympic silver medals. This was followed by another notable performance in the [[1964 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1964]], where Denmark managed to achieve an impressive fourth place. The fourth place was however by many people considered as being more the result of a comparatively easy draw, rather than a result of a well-playing team. In order for Denmark to qualify for the semifinal, they only had to beat nations like [[Malta national football team|Malta]], [[Albania national football team|Albania]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]. At the semifinal, Denmark received a clear 0–3 defeat against the [[Soviet Union national football team|Soviet Union]], and then finally also lost the bronze match to [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]].

The strict rule of only allowing amateurism at the national team was finally abolished by [[Danish Football Association|DBU]] in May 1971, as they had acknowledged this change was needed, in order to build a highly competitive team. In February 1978, when DBU also decided to allow professional football to be introduced in the Danish leagues, the way was at the same time paved for the national team, to sign its first sponsorship with the well-known Danish brewery [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]]. The new sponsorship enabled DBU, to hire [[Sepp Piontek]] from Germany in July 1979, as the first full-time professional coach of the national football team. The full transition of the national team from amateurism to professionalism had now been accomplished, and indeed, this would soon lead to a vast improvement in the performances of the team.<ref name="history"/>

According to Rob Smyth and Lars Eriksen, authors of a 2009 book on the "Danish Dynamite" team that would soon emerge:
{{cquote|That process [the transition to professionalism] was accelerated by the fact that so many of the national team were playing abroad, and values learned there were slowly seeping in. . . . Denmark got a headstart on football globalisation, benefiting from the enlightenment and experience that comes with playing abroad. At [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 84]], their 20-man squad contained 14 overseas-based players; the other seven teams had only five between them. At [[1986 FIFA World Cup|Mexico 86]], their squad included players from the champions of [[Serie A|Italy]], [[Bundesliga|West Germany]], [[Football League First Division|England]], [[Eredivisie|Holland]] and [[Belgian Pro League|Belgium]], but not [[Danish 1st Division|Denmark]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/oct/13/forgotten-story-denmark-1980s |title=The forgotten story of ...

===Danish Dynamite (1980–1990)===
In the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers, Denmark finished with 8 points from as many games, including a 3–1 win against eventual World Cup champions [[Italy national football team|Italy]], but Denmark failed to qualify for the final tournament despite the impressive result. Qualification for the [[1984 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1984]] saw the team beat [[England national football team|England]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]] when [[Allan Simonsen]] converted a [[penalty kick]] for a 1–0 win. Denmark qualified for their first international tournament since 1964, and the team was dubbed "Danish Dynamite" in a competition for the official Danish Euro 1984 song.<ref name="history" /> Denmark's participation ended in the semi-final when the team lost on [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalties]] to [[Spain national football team|Spain]], most remembered for [[Preben Elkjær]]'s penalty miss, his shorts torn apart. Following the strong performance at the finals, the name of "Danish Dynamite" became a mainstay for the following decade of Danish national team football under coach Piontek.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/oct/13/forgotten-story-denmark-1980s | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Rob | last1=Smyth | first2=Lars | last2=Eriksen | title=The forgotten story of ... Danish Dynamite, the Denmark side of the mid-80s | date=13 October 2009}}</ref>

Denmark made their first World Cup appearance in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], and with the attacking duo of [[Michael Laudrup]] and Preben Elkjær the team surprised the world, sweeping the group, including a 6–1 thrashing of [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. In the second round, Denmark once again faced Spain, and once more Denmark lost out. The team received a trashing of their own, losing 5–1, including four goals by [[Emilio Butragueño]]. The first Spanish goal was caused by a miss-timed backpass by [[Jesper Olsen]] to Butragueño, an unfortunate action subsequently coined as "a real Jesper Olsen" (''en rigtig Jesper Olsen''). The phrase would live on for 13 years, and was repeated by the Danish TV commentators in 1999, when an identical backpass was carried out by [[Jesper Grønkjær]] to [[Filippo Inzaghi]], at his debut game for the national team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Den aften, da Jesper Olsen blev glemt |url=|author=Politiken.dk|date=28 March 1999|language=Danish}}</ref>
After the glory days of 1986, the success of the team continued, as it first qualified for the [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1988]] tournament, and then had a nearby qualification for the [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Olympics]]. In the qualification group for the Olympics, the job to coach Denmark in these particular games, had for the first time been given to [[Richard Møller Nielsen]], and he proved his skills, as Denmark initially managed to secure a spot for the final tournament -ahead of West Germany. But following the discovery that Dane [[Per Frimann]] was not eligible for the team's 2–0 win over [[Poland national football team|Poland]], Denmark was penalised the points of the win, and subsequently did not have enough points to qualify. After this disappointing news had arrived, Denmark had to pin all its hope and faith, for a successful performance at the Euro 1988, instead. The straight opposite however happened, as Denmark's participation ended in early defeat after Denmark lost all the group games to Spain, [[Germany national football team|Germany]], and [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. A period of transition with faltering results, had now started, and as Denmark subsequently also failed to qualify for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], Sepp Piontek decided to stop as coach for the national team in April 1990, where he was replaced by his assistant coach Richard Møller Nielsen.

===1992 European Championship Victory===
The first goal for the newly appointed coach was to qualify for the [[1992 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1992]] in Sweden. Denmark started out with a secure home victory against [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]], but the following results in the qualification were an away draw against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and a 2–0 home loss against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]]. Due to the bad start, and a strong disagreement with the coach about the new defensive team tactics, the two best Danish footballers at the time, [[Michael Laudrup]] and [[Brian Laudrup]], decided to quit playing for the team in November 1990. When the coach subsequently also decided to dismiss quality players like [[Jan Mølby]] and [[Jan Heintze]] from the team, due to disciplinary problems, several newspapers started to demand that Richard Møller Nielsen should step down, as the team was clearly falling apart under his influence. Despite this strong criticism, the team managed to win the rest of their five games in the group, including a 2–1 away win against Yugoslavia. This strong comeback was however not enough to qualify, as the team still had to settle with a second place in the group, behind Yugoslavia.

What initially appeared to be a failed qualification, would however soon turn out, to become Denmark's finest hour in the international competitions. Due to international sanctions resulting from the [[Yugoslav wars]], UEFA announced on 31 May 1992 – only 10 days before the competition commenced – that [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] was to be excluded from the competition and their place given to Denmark, who entered as the second-placed team in its qualifying group.<ref>[http://www.newsint-archive.co.uk/pages/S.asp?pubsel=BOTH&SrchText=denmark&DateFromDD=26&DateFromMM=May&DateFromYY=1992&DateToDD=05&DateToMM=Jun&DateToYY=1992&ResultListMax=200&head=&byline=&sect=&Caption=&edn=&page=&SortOrder=Asc&SortField=SDate&Submit1=Search&BackDD=Day&BackMM=Month&BackYY=Year&source=thetimes&SortField=Pub&SortOrder=asc&SortField=EDN&SortOrder=asc&SortField=Page&SortOrder=asc&ST=NS&SortSpec=&ResultMaxDocs=200&Site=ALL&Collection=NI&ResultCount=20&summreqd=yes&indexkey=5A7A1484131591025770&advsrch=0&QueryText=(denmark)+%3CAND%3E+(PUB%3DBOTH)+%3CAND%3E+((SDate%3E%3D5%2F26%2F1992)+%3CAND%3E+(SDate%3C%3D6%2F5%2F1992))&_P=1]</ref>

Contrary to popular belief,<ref name="history" /> the team however did not enter the tournament completely unprepared, after having rallied home from seaside vacations. The majority of players were already assembled to play a friendly match against the [[CIS national football team|CIS]], when Denmark officially got the spot at the tournament.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Schmeichel: The Autobiography|url=|author=Peter Schmeichel|work=pp.97–98, Danish version (ISBN 87-7901-122-5), English version (ISBN 0-7535-0444-8)|year=1999}}</ref> Relying heavily on goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]] and his defense, as well as creative spark Brian Laudrup – having decided to make a comeback for the national team in April 1992 – the Danish team created one of the biggest surprises in the event's history, as they went on to win the European Championship trophy, under coach [[Richard Møller Nielsen]]'s defensive playing style. Advancing from the group stage ahead of [[England national football team|England]] and [[France national football team|France]], Denmark beat the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] defending [[1988 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1988]] champions on penalties in the semifinal, and with the 2–0 win against reigning [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] champions [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the final, Denmark had won its first international trophy.

===Decline and Revival (1993–2000)===

In August 1993, one year after the Euro 1992 win, Michael Laudrup decided to settle his ongoing dispute with Richard Møller Nielsen about the team tactics and made a comeback for the national team. The following years Denmark saw mixed results, as they first failed to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], but then managed to win the [[1995 King Fahd Cup|1995 Confederations Cup]], beating [[Copa América]] champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 2–0 in the final. As defending champions at the [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 1996]], Denmark was not able to continue its previous success, but disappointed with a lacklustre performance, causing an early elimination already in the group stage. Result wise the tournament was not a complete disaster, as the team had achieved a respectable win against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], a draw against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and only a defeat to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]]. The reason why both the coach and team faced strong criticism after the tournament was mainly because of the defensive and boring playing style. As controversy previously had occurred in fall 1995, over DBU's decision to prolong the contract with Richard Møller Nielsen, there was a strained relationship to the press already ahead of the Euro 1996 tournament; and facing a new wave of criticism, the coach decided in a mutual agreement with DBU, to terminate his contract already by the end of June 1996.

The new coach to be assigned, was the sympathetic [[Sweden|Swede]], [[Bo Johansson|Bo "Bosse" Johansson]], who gave the team a more offensive strategy, and the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] saw the revival of the Danish team, starring both Laudrup brothers in their last international campaign. After beating [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] 1–0, drawing with [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] and losing 2–1 to later champions [[France national football team|France]] in mediocre games, the Danish team qualified to the knockout stages as second in the group. In the next game however, Denmark played some of the best football of the entire tournament, beating [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] 4–1 in a fantastic game. In the quarterfinal against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], the Danes went out with a beautiful 2–3 defeat to the later silver medalists, in a very close and emotional game. Next challenge then was, to qualify the team for the [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]], for the first time without the Laudrup brothers. When this goal indeed was achieved by "Bosse", he received a lot of praise. But when the team showed up for the final tournament, and disappointed big time with 3 lost games in the group stage, "Bosse" was heavily criticized for having selected too many players for the squad, with injury problems and poor form.

===The Olsen Gang (2000-2015)===
[[File:FIFA World Ranking Evolution for Denmark national football team.svg|thumb|400px|[[FIFA World Rankings]] for Denmark, August 1993 – July 2009]]
The new coach, starting for Denmark in July 2000, turned out to be the former national team captain from the successful team of the 1980s, [[Morten Olsen]], and the team was quickly dubbed the "[[Olsen Gang]]", a reference to the series of Danish movies based around the main character Egon Olsen and his genius (criminal) plans. The nickname was also sometimes used for the Danish team -as an alternative to the more commonly used "Danish Dynamite"-, already back in those days when Olsen played as a captain. In the era with Olsen as a coach, his great experience from among others [[AFC Ajax|Ajax Amsterdam]] was transferred to the national team, as Denmark's tactics shifted from the preferred 4–4–2 formation practised by [[Bo Johansson]], to an even more attacking style, with an emphasis on the speedy wingers available to him at the time, namely [[Jesper Grønkjær]] and [[Dennis Rommedahl]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Olsen looking for another shock |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/euro_2004/denmark/players_to_watch/3520770.stm|author=BBC Sport|date=24 May 2004|work=BBC News}}</ref> Based on that, the preferred starting formation with Olsen as coach, has always been either a 4–3–3 or a 4–2–3–1.<ref>{{cite web|title=Morten Olsen ist Europas Fußball-Großvater|url=http://www.nordschleswiger.dk/SEEEMS/20000.asp?artid=26351|author=Nordschleswiger.dk|date=13 October 2010|language=German}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Danmark er forvandlet mod Island|url=http://politiken.dk/sport/fodbold/EM-kvalifikation/ECE1053875/danmark-er-forvandlet-mod-island/|author=Politiken.dk|date=7 September 2010|language=Danish}}</ref> He even poses an outspoken opposition to the 4–4–2 system, as he announced the desire to leave his position as national coach, in case he was asked to play with this system as a standard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Olsen: 4–4–2? Ikke med mig!|url=http://www.bt.dk/sport/olsen-4-4-2-ikke-med-mig|author=BT.dk|date=19 November 2007|language=Danish}}</ref> To support the development of players for the new tactical 4–3–3 system used by Olsen, all the national youth teams also changed their formation into the same 4–3–3 system.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sådan spiller de danske landshold|url=http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=238884|author=DBU|date=16 May 2007|language=Danish}}</ref> Another change Olsen brought to the national team, was to stress the importance of only using fit players, who were granted regular playing time at their club team. A principle that he however later has been forced to compromise with at several times, as the player material available in such a relatively small nation, doesn't always provide many realistic substitute options.

Denmark qualified both for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[2004 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2004]], but despite impressive results in the group stage in both tournaments, especially the 2–0 win against reigning World Cup winners [[France national football team|France]] in 2002, Denmark didn't manage to advance any further, and in both tournaments got clearly defeated with a score of 0–3 in the first round after the group stage. At the World Cup 2002 Denmark were defeated by [[England national football team|England]] at round 16, and at Euro 2004 the defeat took place in the quarterfinal against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]]. The Euro 2004 will also be remembered for an incident in the game with [[Italy national football team|Italy]], where Italian star [[Francesco Totti]] was caught on camera spitting on Danish player [[Christian Poulsen]]; and then subsequently the joint elimination of Italy by Denmark and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in the [[2004 European Football Championship - Group C#Denmark vs Sweden|last group stage match]], when the two teams drew 2–2 following a Swedish goal in the 89th minute, making for the exact and famous result that would see the Italians eliminated.

For the [[Football World Cup 2006 - European Qualification Groups#Group 2|2006 World Cup qualification]], Denmark was paired with, among others, 2002 World Cup bronze winners [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] and Euro 2004 champions [[Greece national football team|Greece]] competing for only one guaranteed spot at the final tournament. Following a poor start of the qualification, Denmark were trailing both Turkey and surprise leaders [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]]. Denmark needed Turkey to lose points in the final games in order for Denmark to clinch the 2nd place of the group and one last chance to qualify via two play-off games. Indeed, had Turkey lost points to [[Albania national football team|Albania]] in their last game, Denmark would have gone through, but instead they had to settle for 3rd place in the group and a longer summer break. After failing to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]], coach Olsen considered leaving the job, having received several offers from club teams, but decided to stay and extended his contract until after the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], spurred on by his and the team's popularity among the Danish population.<ref>{{cite web|title=Morten Olsen forlænger med fire år|url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Landsholdet/2005/11/21/151254.htm|author=DR Sporten|date=21 November 2005|language=Danish}}</ref>

When the next attempt to qualify for the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2008]] also failed -after among other things to have received an administrative defeat against Sweden at home turf, due to a spectator's intrusion on the field-, the team got heavily criticized, with many Danes asking for the departure of Morten Olsen as a coach. This suggestion was however refused by [[Danish Football Association|DBU]] and the majority of coaches in the [[Danish Superliga]], who still had trust in Olsen being the best coach for Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trænere: Olsen skal blive|url=http://www.bt.dk/sport/traenere-olsen-skal-blive|author=BT.dk|date=19 November 2007|language=Danish}}</ref> In the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualification group for the 2010 FIFA World Cup]], the trust in Olsen was immediately paid back.  Despite a difficult group with both [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] as higher ranked opponents, Denmark managed to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] by winning the group, after among other things, getting two victories against Sweden and one victory plus a draw against Portugal. After having celebrated the successful World Cup 2010 qualification, the contract with Morten Olsen as coach was extended for two more years, until the [[2012 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2012]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Morten Olsen fortsætter til 2012 |url=http://www.dbu.dk/Nyheder/2010/Januar/morten_olsen_fortsaetter_til_2012.aspx|author=DBU|date=8 January 2010|language=Danish}}</ref>

At the 2010 World Cup, Denmark was grouped with [[Japan national football team|Japan]], [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. Denmark lost the first match 2–0 to Netherlands, but then had a vital 2–1 victory against Cameroon, which enabled further advancement in case of victory over Japan, in the last third match. The game against Japan however ended with a 3–1 defeat, and thereby Denmark didn't reach their declared goal of advancement to round 16. Apparently the biggest reason for the lack of success, was however this time, that Denmark in both the preface -and during the 3 games at the tournament- had struggled with a lot of injuries hitting their best players. However, Denmark wouldn't wait for long to please the Danish public once again. In the qualification for [[2012 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2012]], Denmark was once again grouped with [[Portugal National Football Team|Portugal]], among other countries. For a second time, Denmark clinched first place in the group, and thereby qualified directly for the final tournament. Out of 8 qualifying games, Denmark managed to win 6, draw 1 and losing only 1 game. Mostly because of these results, Morten Olsen and [[Danish Football Association|DBU]] decided to extend his contract as national team coach until after the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

At Euro 2012, Denmark were drawn in the proclaimed "Group of Death", along with powerhouses [[Germany National Football Team|Germany]], [[Netherlands National Football Team|Netherlands]] and [[Portugal National Football Team|Portugal]]. Few gave Denmark a chance of proceeding to the second round before the tournament, but after upsetting Netherlands with a 1-0 victory, there was cause for optimism in the Danish camp. A narrow 3-2 loss to Portugal however meant that Denmark would probably have to beat Germany in the last game, in order to advance further in the tournament. Despite [[Michael Krohn-Dehli]]'s equaliser, Denmark ended up losing 2-1 against Germany, and with the same result for Netherlands against Portugal in the other game, Denmark was eliminated from the tournament by finishing third in the group. The Danish team was mostly received with praise after the tournament, considering the fact that Denmark had exceeded expectations and actually had been close to advancing to the knock-out stages, despite ending up in a difficult group.

====Overall statistics for The Olsen Gang====
When measuring the performance of the national team by winning share and earned points, Olsen's reign of the Danish national team from July 2000 until January 2012, has so far been the second most successful in the era of full-time professional coaches, which began in July 1979. As of January 2012, [[Morten Olsen]] has a winning share of 52.8%, and with three points for a victory and one for a draw, Olsen has an average of 1.84 points per game.<ref name="MO games">{{cite web|title=Morten Olsen coach profile |url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseCoachInfo.aspx?coachid=4118&teamtypeid=330&genderid=1|author=DBU|language=Danish}}</ref> In comparison, [[Richard Møller Nielsen]] still has the best record among the professional coaches of the Denmark national football team, with a 54.8% winning share and an average of 1.89 points per game.<ref name="RMN games">{{cite web|title=Richard Møller Nielsen coach profile|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseCoachInfo.aspx?coachid=4116|author=DBU|language=Danish}}</ref> This kind of statistic of course only provide an overall indication of the performance, as it doesn't take the difficulty of the opponents into account -and/or the number of "difficult games". For a more accurate evaluation of the performance of the national team under the guidance of various coaches, one should also compare the development in the team's position at the official [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA ranking]] or [[World Football Elo Ratings|Elo ranking]], where the merits of qualification and results in the final European Championship and World Cup tournament get the highest weight. Beside of the success of Olsen to qualify Denmark for the World Cup in 2002 and 2010, and the European Championship in 2004 and 2012, he also gained several great results in the friendly games. In example, a friendly 4–1 win over [[England national football team|England]] in 2005; being the worst loss for the English team since 1980, and a repetition of the friendly 3–2 win achieved by Denmark on English ground at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]] in 2003.

==Supporters==
{{main|Roligan}}
Apart from the national team, Denmark is equally famous for its traveling fans, known as ''[[roligans]]''. The movement emerged during the 1980s as the declared opposition to [[football hooliganism|hooliganism]]. The goal of the roligan movement is calm, yet cheerful, support during the matches, as ''rolig'' means calm in the [[Danish language]]. The roligans have since developed an image of easy-going nature and rabid support, and are often considered amongst the world's best national team fans, along with the [[Tartan Army]] of Scotland. They were collectively given the FIFA FairPlay Award at the 1984 European Championships.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historie -De Danske Roligans|url=http://www.roliganklubben.dk/hvem-er-vi/historie.html|author=RoliganKlubben|language=Danish}}</ref> Just before the 1986 World Cup, the roligan movement was organized in order to support the national team at the tournament.

The good reputation of the Danish supporters was however sullied by the [[2008 UEFA qualifier fan attack]], happening in June 2007 at the [[Euro 2008]] qualifying game against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]], when an enraged Danish supporter invaded the pitch and tried to attack the referee, following his decision to hand out a red card for [[Christian Poulsen]] and a penalty kick to Sweden at the last minute of the game. The attacking fan was stopped by some of the Danish football players on the field, before he reached the referee, but due to the episode the game was immediately canceled by the referee, and UEFA subsequently decided to award a 0–3 defeat for Denmark, as a punishment.

==Media coverage==
Denmark's home and away matches are broadcast by [[SBS Discovery Media]] ([[Kanal 5 (Denmark)|Kanal 5]], [[6'eren]], [[Canal 9 (Denmark)|Canal 9]]).

==Stadium==
{{For|stadium history|Telia Parken}}
[[File:Kparken.JPG|thumb|245px|right|[[Telia Parken]], with a capacity of 38,065 spectators, located in Copenhagen, and used as official home stadium by the Denmark national football team.]]
First home game of the Denmark national football team, was a 2–1 friendly win over [[England national football team|England]] at 25 May 1910, taking place with 12,000 spectators at the stadium "KBs baner" (located in the area "Granen", where [[Forum Copenhagen]] later was built).<ref>{{cite web|title=Landskampsstatistik -KBs baner (København)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseCountryInfo.aspx?stadiumid=1113&teamtypeid=330&genderid=1#match|author=DBU|language=Danish}}</ref> As the facilities were considered too small, a new stadium in [[Copenhagen]] was built with the name '''[[Idrætsparken]]''', that since its opening 25 May 1911 hosted all the home games of the football club [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub|KB]] and most of the home games of the national team. During the first 82 years of the national team, from October 1908 until November 1990, Denmark played a total number of 254 A-level home games, of which 232 were played in Idrætsparken. Among all the played home games in Idrætsparken, Denmark achieved 125 victories (54%), 41 draws (18%) and 66 lost games (28%); and the stadium reached a record of 51,600 spectators for the 1–2 game against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in June 1957.<ref>{{cite web|title=Landskampsstatistik -Idrætsparken (København)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseCountryInfo.aspx?stadiumid=1124#stat|author=DBU|language=Danish}}</ref> In regards of the first era from 1908–1990, only 22 home games were played at other stadiums than Idrætsparken; of which 11 took place at [[NRGi Park]] (then known as Atletion) in [[Århus]], followed by [[Aalborg Stadion]] in [[Aalborg]] with 6 games, and the remaining 5 games hosted by four other stadiums. Whenever another stadium than Idrætsparken was used for a home game, it was however only for some of the less important friendly games or Olympic qualifiers. While only Idrætsparken was used to host the games related to big important tournaments, like the [[Nordic Football Championship|Nordic championship]], [[UEFA European Football Championship|European Championship]] and [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. When a major rebuilt of Idrætsparken began in December 1990, the subsequent two official Euro 1992 qualification games, were however moved to [[Fionia Park|Odense Stadium]] in [[Odense]].

On 9 September in 1992, the rebuilt Idrætsparken, now called '''Parken''' and later rename '''[[Telia Parken]]''', became the biggest venue in Denmark with 42,358 seats, and was opened with a friendly 1–2 defeat against [[Germany national football team|Germany]]. This first game in Parken had a visit of 40,500 spectators;<ref>{{cite web|title=Landsholdsdatabasen kamp information: Danmark-Tyskland (1–2)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseMatchInfo.aspx?matchid=1518|author=DBU|date=9 September 1992|language=Danish}}</ref> while the current stadium record at 42,099 spectators was reached 8 October 2005, for a World Cup qualifying game against [[Greece national football team|Greece]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Landsholdsdatabasen kamp information: Danmark-Grækenland (1–0)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseMatchInfo.aspx?matchid=4635|author=DBU|date=8 October 2005|language=Danish}}</ref>

The capacity of the stadium was later reduced to 38,009 seats, after the upper part of the D-side was converted from 4,000 extra seats into office and VIP areas, in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sædekategorier i Parken |url=http://www.dbu.dk/sitecore/content/Faelles/landshold/Billetsalg/saedekategorier_i_parken.aspx|author=DBU|date=13 May 2010|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Superbest tribune står klar medio 2009|url=http://www.fck.dk/nyhedsvisning/?newsid=7383|author=FCK official website|date=29 October 2007|language=Danish}}</ref> Despite this decrease in capacity, the stadium is today still the [[List of football stadiums in Denmark|biggest venue in Denmark]] by far; as the next biggest venue [[Brøndby Stadium]] only has a capacity of 26,000 seats. During the time from September 1992 until May 2006, Parken was the sole stadium of all the men's senior national team matches. However, meagre spectator support at some of the friendly matches at Parken, which for the years in 2000–2005 attracted an acceptable average of 23,862 per game, but down to 9,598 for the friendly 3–1 win over [[Israel national football team|Israel]] in April 2002;<ref>{{cite web|title=Landsholdsdatabasen kamp information: Danmark-Israel (3–1)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseMatchInfo.aspx?matchid=3924|author=DBU|date=17 April 2002|language=Danish}}</ref> caused the decision by DBU, to start moving many of the friendly matches to other stadiums around the country. These other stadiums had less spectator capacity than Parken, but just about enough, to cover the Danes somewhat lower interest for the friendly games.

At 27 May 2006, Parken's 13-year monopoly on national team matches got broken for the first time, when Denmark played a friendly game at the NRGi Park stadium in Århus, against the World Cup 2006 participants [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]. This particular game got outsold within a short while, with almost 19,000 of the 20,227 tickets being sold within the first hour of sale,<ref>{{cite web|title=Billetter til Århus-landskamp revet væk |url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Landsholdet/2006/02/24/121539.htm|author=DR Sporten|date=24 February 2006|language=Danish}}</ref> and was support-wise a big success with a total audience of 20,047 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|title=Landsholdsdatabasen kamp information: Danmark-Paraguay (1–1)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseMatchInfo.aspx?matchid=4967|author=DBU|date=27 May 2006|language=Danish}}</ref> When the two next friendly games were played at some other new venues, 16 August at [[Fionia Park]] in Odense with [[Poland national football team|Poland]] as opponent, and 1 September at [[Brøndby Stadium]] with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] as opponent, the number of spectators however dropped to a disappointing level. The match against Poland only attracted 11,088 spectators,<ref>{{cite web|title=Landsholdsdatabasen kamp information: Danmark-Polen (2–0)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseMatchInfo.aspx?matchid=5030|author=DBU|date=16 August 2006|language=Danish}}</ref> while the match against Portugal only attracted 13,186 spectators;<ref>{{cite web|title=Landsholdsdatabasen kamp information: Danmark-Portugal (4–2)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseMatchInfo.aspx?matchid=5033|author=DBU|date=1 September 2006|language=Danish}}</ref> and the match against Portugal was in particular deemed as a support-wise failure, as it featured a higher ranked opponent, which spectators normally would have a high interest to watch. The main reasons why Brøndby Stadium failed to attract a high number of spectators, were generally thought to be a combination of the poor rainy weather, and the fact that this stadium is located on the outskirts of Copenhagen; and as such does not attract a new demographic audience compared to Parken, due to the travel distances being more or less the same for the majority of the population.

Currently, while most of the friendly games continue to be played at some of the smaller stadiums in Denmark, it has been decided to continue playing all of the qualifying games for the European Championships and World Cup, only at Parken Stadium.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ny aftale mellem DBU og Parken|url=http://www.dr.dk/Sporten/Fodbold/Landsholdet/2009/11/17/142444.htm|author=DR Sporten|date=17 November 2009|language=Danish}}</ref> Those friendly games, which are believed to create a high interest from spectators, will also continue to be played at Parken. In example, the friendly game against Germany in August 2010, took place at Parken Stadium, due to the general expectation of many spectators having a desire to watch the game. After the weak performance of Denmark at the World Cup 2010, the friendly game however only managed to draw a total number of 19,071 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|title=Landsholdsdatabasen kamp information: Danmark-Tyskland (2–2)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseMatchInfo.aspx?matchid=5976|author=DBU|date=11 August 2010|language=Danish}}</ref>
During the last 19.5 years, from September 1992 until January 2012, Denmark played a total of 77 A-level games at Parken Stadium; of which 49 were won (64%), 16 were drawn (21%), and only 12 were lost (15%).<ref>{{cite web|title=Landskampsstatistik -Parken (København)|url=http://www.dbu.dk/landshold/landsholdsdatabasen/LBaseCountryInfo.aspx?stadiumid=362&teamtypeid=330&genderid=1#match|author=DBU|language=Danish}}</ref>

{{See also|List of Denmark international footballers}}
The players are freely chosen by the national team manager. They are normally assembled, from their respective club teams, at Hotel Marienlyst in [[Elsinore]] for a week-long training camp preluding the upcoming game. Friendly games are typically played on a Wednesday evening. World Cup qualifiers are played on both Saturday and Wednesday evenings; while Euro qualifiers now take place on both a Friday and Tuesday evening when playing two games in a row, or on a Friday/Saturday/Tuesday at rounds with only one game scheduled.<ref name=Program>{{cite web|title=Landsholdets program|url=http://www.dbu.dk/sitecore/content/Faelles/landshold/herrelandshold/A-landsholdstruppen/landsholdets_program.aspx|author=DBU|date=20 May 2010|language=Danish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Danmark mod Island først og Portugal sidst i EM-kvalifikationen |url=http://www.dbu.dk/Nyheder/2010/Marts/danmark_mod_island_foerst_og_portugal_sidst_i_em-kvalifikationen.aspx |author=DBU|date=25 March 2010|language=Danish}}</ref>

===Payment===
Each player in the national team receives a set amount of money per game, including bonuses for a game win and qualification for European Championship and World Cup tournaments. Through the years, these money prizes have gone from around €1,340 for a game win in 1987 and around €26,800 for the Euro 1988 participation alone, to around €67,000 for the 1998 World Cup, and up to €107,000 for the 2002 World Cup participations, per player.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Tyve år på toppen|url=|author=Jan Heintze|publisher=Cicero|work=ISBN 87-7714-459-7|year=2002|language=Danish}}</ref>
Currently, the payments for participation in games outside the big tournaments are regulated by a collective agreement -to be renegotiated after a certain number of years-, while all payments for participation of players in a final tournament squad are regulated by the ''1998 agreement'' between DBU and [[:da:Spillerforeningen|Spillerforeningen]]. The ''1998 agreement'' has outlined, that whenever the team manage to qualify for a World Cup or European Championship, the selected players for the final tournament shall receive 50% of DBU's revenues from the event, and 65% of DBU's revenues from the sale of merchandise and license agreements. In top of that, the sponsors of the team also pay a relatively high ''qualification bonus'', each time the team qualify for a final tournament. This additional ''qualification bonus'' is shared between the group of players being selected for the final 18-man squad, to one or several of the qualification matches played, with the exact distribution normally decided according to the number of times the player was selected.<ref name="DBU payment">{{cite web|title=120 millioner kroner for VM-titel|url=http://www.dbu.dk/Nyheder/2010/Maj/120_millioner_kroner_for_VM-titel.aspx|author=DBU|date=3 June 2010|language=Danish}}</ref>

Each of the 23 selected players for the 2002 World Cup received DKK 498,000 (equal to €66,800) from the event revenues,<ref name="DBU payment" /> plus DKK 122,900 (equal to €16,500) from the sale of merchandise and license agreements, plus an unknown qualification bonus from the sponsors, plus the standard payment from DBU each time they got selected for the final 18-man squad to a qualification match.<ref name="Player bonus">{{cite web|title=Player bonus |url=http://www.dbu.dk/oevrigt_indhold/Media/FIFA%202010%20Media%20Guide/Player%20bonus.aspx|author=DBU|date=10 June 2010}}</ref> In comparison, each of the 23 selected players for the 2010 World cup received DKK 635,000 (equal to €85,100) from the event revenues, plus DKK 98,900 (equal to €13,200) from the sale of merchandise and license agreements, plus a qualification bonus from the sponsors at DKK 2,800,000 (equal to €375,000) to be shared between the players -corresponding to an amount of €2,080 per time the player got selected for the final 18-man squad to a qualification match. Beside of the qualification bonus, the players also received this standard payment from DBU, each time they were selected for the 18-man squad to a qualification match:<ref name="Player bonus" />

* '''Starting fee:''' home games = DKK 1,2 per spectator, away games = DKK 8,290
* '''Bonus for a draw:''' home games = DKK 0, away games = DKK 9,475
* '''Bonus for a win:''' home games = DKK 17,765, away games = DKK 29,600

Based on Denmark's results and number of spectators at home games,<ref name="MO games" /> the standard qualification match payment, to a player selected for all Denmark's qualification matches, hereby equals a total amount of DKK 235,898 (or €31,600) for the 6 qualification matches in the 2008–09 season, and a total amount of DKK 170,788 (or €22,900) for the 4 qualification matches in the 2009–10 season. Finally the players could also add a seasonal payment named "regular bonus" from the sponsors, with a total of DKK 4,350,000 (equal to €583,100) to be shared each season by the squad of 18 players selected for a match; meaning that a player who got selected for all matches of the national team from 1 August to 31 July, would receive an additional amount of DKK 241,700 (equal to €32,400) in both the 2008–09 season and 2009–10 season.<ref name="Player bonus" />

The last amount of a players income generated by the national team, is the standard payment received for each friendly match:<ref name="Players bonus in 2004-2010">{{cite web|title=Players bonus (1st August 2004 to 31st July 2010) |url=http://diwa.sbu.dbu.dk/page.aspx?id=453|author=SBU|year=2004}}</ref>
* '''Starting fee:''' home games = DKK 1,0 per spectator, away games = DKK 5,000
* '''Bonus for a draw:''' home games = DKK 0, away games = DKK 0
* '''Bonus for a win:''' home games = DKK 10,000, away games = DKK 10,000

Based on Denmark's results and number of spectators at home games,<ref name="MO games" /> the standard payment to a player selected for all Denmark's friendly matches, hereby equals a total amount of DKK 41,426 (or €5,500) for the 3 friendly matches in the 2008–09 season, and a total amount of DKK 88,773 (or €11,900) for the 7 friendly matches in the 2009–10 season.

When all these payments are added together for a player, under the assumption that he was selected for all matches in each season, and the final 2010 World Cup squad, then he would have received a total payment from DBU at €69,500 in the 2008–09 season, and a total payment from DBU at €186,300 in the 2009–10 season.

===Player names and numbers===
Shirt numbers became quickly associated with a certain position. So to describe someone as 'Denmark's number 9' would be to describe a player as the best choice for [[centre forward]]. This terminology continues today, and the team has kept to the tradition of numbering players in the starting squad from 1 to 11 (with 12 upwards for [[Substitute (football)|substitute]]s), at all games played outside the major tournaments. For games at major tournaments, such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] or the [[UEFA European Football Championship]], the team is required to play with permanent squad numbers throughout the tournament.

Numbers are traditionally associated with a certain position on the field, but there are no set rules. Furthermore, established players will tend to use the same number whenever they play. [[Christian Poulsen]], for example, retained the Denmark number 2 no matter what position he played in. However, when Poulsen did not play, another player would be number 2.

===Best players of all time===
In November 2006, the Danish Football Association nominated eight Danish national team footballers for the "Best Danish Footballer of All Time" award. The nominated players were [[Morten Olsen]], [[Henning Jensen]], [[Allan Simonsen]], [[Preben Elkjær Larsen|Preben Elkjær]], [[Michael Laudrup]], [[Brian Laudrup]], [[Peter Schmeichel]], and [[Jon Dahl Tomasson]]. The winner of the award was decided by a public vote arranged by the broadcasting channel [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV2]], which ended with Michael Laudrup as a clear winner, with 58% of the votes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Michael Laudrup -Danmarks bedste gennem tiderne |url=http://www.bt.dk/sport/michael-laudrup-danmarks-bedste-gennem-tiderne |author=BT.dk|date=13 November 2006|language=Danish}}</ref>

===Hall of Fame===
Denmark's Hall of Fame was established in October 2008, as a special award to celebrate the best footballers, teams and coaches; throughout the history of the national team. A jury with 6 people (representing the newspapers, authors of football books, active players of the national team, [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV2]], [[Danish Football Association|DBU]], and a Hall of Fame member), each year have the job to award one or two new members for the Hall of Fame. The award will be handed out at the official Danish Football Awards, which is a yearly television broadcast event – organized by DBU in November throughout 2008–2013 and subsequently moved to a later date in February. Beside of receiving the award, all Hall of Fame members are also invited to leave a footprint in bronze, to decorate the entrance hall at "Fodboldens hus" -the DBU headquarters in [[Brøndby]].<ref name="HoF-1">{{cite web |title=Fodbolden får egen Hall of Fame |url=http://www.dbu.dk/news/newsShow.aspx?id=248749 |author=DBU|date=1 October 2008|language=Danish}}</ref> When DBU celebrated its 125-year birthday in May 2014, it was decided to make an extraordinary award of nine additional Hall of Fame Members, all playing during the first half of the DBU national football team's existence, in 1908–1964.<ref name="9 extra HoF-members awarded in 2014">{{cite web|url=http://politiken.dk/sport/fodbold/ECE2292460/ni-nye-danskere-er-optaget-i-fodboldens-hall-of-fame/|title=Ni nye danskere er optaget i fodboldens Hall of Fame|language=Danish|publisher=Politiken|date=17 May 2014}}</ref> Because of financial restraints, DBU decided to cancel the planned televised broadcast of the Football Award in February 2015, and for the same reason opted not to award any new Hall of Fame members in this specific year. DBU expect to return awarding new Hall of Fame members again, when the next broadcast Football Award event is organized in February 2016.<ref name="No HoF-members awarded in 2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.dbu.dk/Nyheder/2015/Februar/DFA_2014|title=Hvem er Danmarks bedste i 2014?|publisher=DBU|date=4 February 2015}}</ref>

===Managers===
{{main|Denmark national football team statistics#Managers}}
The responsibility and job description for the manager of the Denmark national football team, has changed throughout the history. In the first years from 1908–1918, DBU preferred to assign a manager with the overall responsibility. But this was followed by a long era in 1919–1956, with either no manager or only a [[Caretaker manager (football)|caretaker manager]] assigned. When DBU decided to assign [[Arne Sørensen]] (November 1956-December 1961) and [[Poul Petersen (footballer)|Poul Petersen]] (January 1962-December 1966) as managers for a roling period of several years, they were granted the responsibility to coach the physical training and decide the team tactics before and during the game, but had no influence upon the selection of players for the national team -which was a job for the special appointed selection committee: "UdtagelsesKomitéen".<ref name="Manager history">{{cite web|title=DBUs landstrænere i perioden 1967–69|url=http://diwa.sbu.dbu.dk/page.aspx?id=1183|author=SBU|date=26 November 2001|language=Danish}}</ref>

For the years in 1967–1969, the management of the team more or less became a sole responsibility for "UdtagelsesKomitéen", following a new approach. In this new approach, the job to select players continued to be the responsibility for "UdtagelsesKomitéen", but the chairman of the committee was now also appointed to be the "tactical manager" of the national team, as DBU realised the need of having a special tactical manager assigned, to get influence upon both the selection of players and the related tactics before and during the game. The appointed tactical manager, however didn't have the responsibility to train the team, as a special physical coach was selected for that part of the job. In 1970, the approach with two managers assigned was however abandoned again, when DBU realised the need to assign only one manager with the sole responsibility of the team.<ref name="Manager history"/>

For the years in 1970–1979, the job to select players was however not yet a sole responsibility of the manager alone, but only a shared responsibility, as this continued to be a matter for "UdtagelsesKomitéen" to decide. When a selection of players had to be made, it was decided by a vote in the committee, with the appointed manager being granted an influence of 3 votes, and the four members of the committee being granted 1 vote each. This special selection procedure continued until July 1979, where it was decided to hand out the sole responsibility of all manager related areas, to the manager himself, with the assignment of [[Sepp Piontek]] as the first full-time professional manager of the national football team.<ref name="Manager history"/>

<br>The box below, list all assigned football managers for the national team, since the first official game in October 1908.<br>
During the years from 1911 to 1961, a total of 169 games were played without an assigned manager.
