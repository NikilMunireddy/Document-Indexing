{{2010 Commonwealth Games}}

The '''2010 [[Commonwealth Games]]''', officially known as the '''XIX Commonwealth Games''', were held in [[Delhi]], [[India]], from 3 to 14 October 2010. A total of 6,081 athletes from 71 [[The Commonwealth|Commonwealth nations and dependencies]] competed in 21 sports and 272 events, making it the largest [[Commonwealth Games]] to date. It was also the largest international [[multi-sport event]] to be staged in Delhi and India, eclipsing the [[Asian Games]] in [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] and [[1982 Asian Games|1982]]. The [[2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|opening]] and closing ceremonies were held at the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]], the main stadium of the event. It was the first time that the Commonwealth Games were held in India and the second time it was held in Asia after [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia in [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]]. This also marked the first time a [[Republics in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth Republic]] hosted the games. The official mascot of the Games was ''[[Shera (mascot)|Shera]]'' and the official song of the Games, "[[Jiyo Utho Bado Jeeto]]", was composed by celebrated Indian musician [[A.R. Rahman]].

Preparation for the Games received widespread international media attention, with criticism being levelled against the organisers for the [[Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games|slow pace of work]], as well as issues related to security and hygiene. However, all member nations of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] participated in the event, except [[Fiji]], which is suspended from the Commonwealth, and [[Tokelau]], which didn't send a team, in spite of threats of boycotts and athlete withdrawals. The internationally acclaimed [[2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] improved the image of the Games,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/oct/03/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-delhi-india |title='India has arrived': spectacular ceremony opens Commonwealth Games |publisher=The Guardian, UK |date= 3 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010 | location=London | first=Jason | last=Burke| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006004503/http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/oct/03/commonwealth-games-opening-ceremony-delhi-india| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8039988/Commonwealth-Games-2010-India-opens-doors-to-the-world-at-opening-ceremony.html |title=Commonwealth Games 2010: India opens doors to the world at opening ceremony |work=The Telegraph |date=3 October 2010|accessdate=5 October 2010 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Hart| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006045221/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8039988/Commonwealth-Games-2010-India-opens-doors-to-the-world-at-opening-ceremony.html| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref> and dispelled negative notions surrounding them, with many observers remarking that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/101015/sports/cgames2010_aus|title=Australia praises India's 'exceptional' Games|date=15 October 2010|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]| accessdate=14 February 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> The President of the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[Jacques Rogge]], said that India had made a good foundation for a future Olympics bid, which was reiterated by the Australian Ministry of Sports.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/india-should-aim-for-olympics-australian-sports-minister-57139|title=India should aim for Olympics: Australian Sports Minister|publisher=[[NDTV]]|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008222034/http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/india-should-aim-for-olympics-australian-sports-minister-57139| archivedate= 8 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games-2010/news/Games-good-foundation-for-Olympic-bid-by-India-Rogge/articleshow/6680736.cms|title=Games good foundation for Olympic bid by India: Rogge|work=The Times of India | date=4 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Commonwealth games Federation chief Mike Fennell stated that "Delhi delivered a fantastic Games".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/specials/sports/cwg-2010/Delhi-delivered-a-fantastic-Games/newdelhi/SP-Article10-613055.aspx |title=‘Delhi delivered a fantastic Games’ |work=Hindustan Times |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref> Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/its-time-to-reflect-on-how-delhi-got-it-right-20101014-16ltt.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010|first=Peter|last=Hanlon|title=It's time to reflect on how Delhi got it right| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017152227/http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/its-time-to-reflect-on-how-delhi-got-it-right-20101014-16ltt.html| archivedate= 17 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Organising committee===
The organisation of CWG 2010 was beset by delays: in January 2010, the Indian Olympic Association vice-chairman Raja Randhir Singh expressed concern that Delhi was not up to speed in forming and organising its games committee and, following a 2009 [[Indian Government]] report showing two-thirds of venues were behind schedule, [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] president Mike Fennell stated that the slow progress of preparations represented a serious risk to the event.<ref name="bbc_cg">{{cite news|title=India admits 2010 Games problems|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8256127.stm|publisher=BBC  | date=15 September 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}</ref> Singh also called for a revamp of the games' organising committees:<ref name="reuters_cg">{{cite news|title=Olympic official calls for revamp of Delhi Games committee|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-42471320090915|agency=Reuters   | date=15 September 2009| accessdate=14 January 2011 }}</ref> Jarnail Singh,
a former Secretary of the Government of India, was appointed as the chief executive officer and [[Indian Olympic Association]] president [[Suresh Kalmadi]] was appointed as head of the committee.

===Costs===
The initial total budget estimated by the [[Indian Olympic Association]] in 2003 for hosting the Games was {{INRConvert|16.2|b}}.

A four-lane flyway, 2.2&nbsp;km stretch from [[Lodhi Road]] to trans-Yamuna, linking the [[Commonwealth Games Village 2010|Games Village]] to the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Delhi|Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium]] was constructed which reduced the travelling time between the [[Commonwealth Games Village 2010|village]] and the Stadium to six minutes.

In response to concerns over the large number of trains that pass by the Delhi metropolitan region daily, construction of road under-bridges and over-bridges along railway lines have been completed. To expand road infrastructure, flyovers, cloverleaf flyovers, and bridges were built to improve links for the Games and city in general. Road-widening projects were finished with an emphasis being placed on expanding national highways. To improve traffic flow on existing roads, plans were made to make both the inner and outer Ring roads signal free.

To support its commitment to mass transport, nine corridors have been identified and were constructed as High Capacity Bus Systems (for example, one from Ambedkar Nagar to [[Red Fort]]). Six of these corridors were expected to be operational in 2010. Additionally, The [[Delhi Metro]] was expanded to accommodate more people and boost the use of public transport during the 2010 games. The metro has extended to [[Gurgaon]] and the [[Noida]] area. For this large increase in the size of the network, Delhi Metro had deployed 14 [[tunnel boring machine]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/business/20080318/105062.htm|title=Delhi Metro deploys 'record' 14 tunnel boring machines|accessdate=14 May 2008}}</ref> [[Radio Frequency Identification]] (RFID) was used to tag vehicles in venue parking lots to help organise mass parking and increase security.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rfidworld.ca/delhi-commonwealth-games-2010-using-rfid-tags/189|title=Delhi Commonwealth Games 2010 using RFID tags

[[Indira Gandhi International Airport]] was modernised, expanded, and upgraded. Costing nearly $1.95&nbsp;billion, [[Indira Gandhi International Airport#Terminal 3|Terminal 3]] has increased airport passenger capacity to more than 37 million passengers a year by 2010. A new runway has been constructed, allowing for more than 75 flights an hour. At more than 4400 metres long, it is one of Asia's longest. The airport has been connected to the city via a six-lane expressway ([[Delhi–Gurgaon Expressway]]) and the $580&nbsp;million [[Delhi Airport Metro Express]] line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newdelhiairport.in/ |title=Indira Gandhi International Airport |publisher=Newdelhiairport.in |accessdate=14 October 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030122648/http://www.newdelhiairport.in/| archivedate= 30 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Green Games===
The organisers signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Environment Programme to show the intention to host a "sustainable games" and to take the environment into consideration when constructing and renovating venues. [[Thyagaraj Sports Complex|Thyagaraj Stadium]] is intended to be a key example of environmentally considered construction.

In opposition to this intention, a number of environmental controversies arose and the adverse ecological impact of various aspects of the games have been protested by city residents.<ref>[http://delhigreens.com/tag/trees/ Trees].

===Other preparation===
In preparation for an influx of English-speaking tourists for the Games, the Delhi government implemented a program to teach English, and the necessary skills for serving tourists, to key workers—such as cab drivers, [[security guard|security workers]], waiters, porters, and service staff. In the two years prior to the Games 2,000 drivers were taught English. In addition to Delhi, the Indian Government plans to expand the program to teach people in local tourist destinations in other parts of India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/travel/20080330/107541.htm|title=Lessons in English and etiquette ahead of Commonwealth Games|last=Roy|first=Rajeev Ranjan|date=30 March 2008|accessdate=13 May 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411211929/http://www.indiaenews.com/travel/20080330/107541.htm| archivedate= 11 April 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

[[File:HOHO DELHI.jpg|thumb|left|HOHO Delhi Bus Inauguration in Delhi]]
To facilitate hassle-free sightseeing in Delhi, [[Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation|Delhi Tourism]] undertook the launch of India's very first Hop on Hop Off bus known as [http://delhitourism.nic.in/delhitourism/transport/hoho.jsp HOHO DELHI], modelled on popular concept of transport facilities in Western countries. The bus, which is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies like digital video screens and GPS systems, also had trained guides who were responsible for giving information about the sites.

To prepare for the energy-usage spike during the Games and to end chronic [[power cuts]] in [[Delhi]], the government undertook a large power-production initiative to increase power production to 7,000 MW (from the current 4,500 MW). To achieve this goal, the government streamlined the power distribution process, direct additional energy to Delhi, and constructed new power plants.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20080321/105643.htm|title=Delhi will have surplus powe...|date=21 March 2008|accessdate=13 May 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504194524/http://www.indiaenews.com/india/20080321/105643.htm| archivedate= 4 May 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

The baton was designed by Michael Foley, a graduate of the National Institute of Design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/events-tournaments/commonwealth-games-2010/top-stories/Relay-baton-depicts-Indias-diverse-culture-tradition/articleshow/5178236.cms |title=Relay baton depicts India's diverse culture & tradition |work=The Times of India |date=30 October 2009 |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref> It is a triangular section of aluminium twisted into a [[helix]] shape and then coated with coloured soils collected from all the regions of India. The coloured soils are a first for the styling of a Queen's Baton. A jewel-encrusted box was used to house the Queen's message, which was laser-engraved onto a miniature 18 carat gold leaf—representative of the ancient Indian 'patras. The Queen's baton is ergonomically contoured for ease of use. It is {{convert|664|mm}} high, {{convert|34|mm}} wide at the base, and {{convert|86|mm}} wide at the top and weighs {{convert|1900|g}}.

* Embedded [[light emitting diodes]] (LEDs) which will change into the colours of a country's flag whilst in that country

==Concerns and controversies==
{{Main|Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games}}

Several concerns were raised over the preparations of the Games and these included excessive [[cost overrun|budget overruns]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/news/sports/commonwealth-games-2010-the-ballooning-budget-19366.php |title=Commonwealth Games 2010: The ballooning budget |publisher=NDTV |date= 7 April 2010 | accessdate=24 September 2010}}</ref> likelihood of floods in Delhi due to heavy [[monsoon]] rains, infrastructural compromise, poor living conditions at the [[Commonwealth Games Village 2010|Commonwealth Games Village]], delays in construction of the [[Venues of the 2010 Commonwealth Games|main Games' venues]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9028263.stm |title=Commonwealth Games 2010: England urge more Delhi work |publisher=BBC News  |date= 24 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924044207/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9028263.stm| archivedate= 24 September 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9029049.stm |title=Australia say India should not host Commonwealth Games |publisher=BBC News  |date= 24 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926213230/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9029049.stm| archivedate= 26 September 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref> the withdrawal of prominent athletes,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/8825573.stm |title=Geraint Thomas pulls out of Commonwealth Games in Delhi |publisher=BBC News  |date= 24 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924044456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/8825573.stm| archivedate= 24 September 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref> widespread corruption by officials of the Games' Organising Committee<ref>{{cite news|last=Rossingh |first=Danielle |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-22/delhi-faces-filth-security-fears-bridge-collapse-at-commonwealth-games.html |title=Bridge Collapse Adds Safety to Terror Fears Before Delhi Games |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=24 September 2010 |date=22 September 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925214120/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-22/delhi-faces-filth-security-fears-bridge-collapse-at-commonwealth-games.html| archivedate= 25 September 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref> and possibility of a terrorist attack by militants.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/delhi-on-terror-alert-for-commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony/story-e6frfkyi-1225938435194#ixzz2AtFO051J |title=Delhi on terror alert for Commonwealth Games closing ceremony |publisher=news.com.au |date=14 October 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014135333/http://www.news.com.au/world/delhi-on-terror-alert-for-commonwealth-games-closing-ceremony/story-e6frfkyi-1225938435194| archivedate= 14 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

The negative pre-event publicity and heavy security presence played in part in low spectator attendance during the initial events. However the numbers picked up as the Games progressed.

===Formation of dedicated investigation committee===
The day after the conclusion of the Games, the Indian Government announced the formation of a special committee to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement against the Organising Committee. The probe committee will be led by former [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] VK Shunglu. This probe will be in addition to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], [[Enforcement Directorate]], and [[Central Vigilance Commission]] investigations already underway. The [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Manmohan Singh|Dr Manmohan Singh]] had promised in mid-August, when reports of the bungling first surfaced, that corrupt officials will be given "severe and exemplary" punishment after the Games. The probe committee is tasked with looking into "all aspects of organising and conducting" the Games, and "to draw lessons from it." It was given three months to submit its report, but the report was never publicly released.<ref name="Times of India">{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-16/india/28259235_1_probe-panel-oc-bosses-alleged-misappropriation|title=CWG: Probe panel to report in 3 months |work=The Times of India |date=16 October 2010 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref><ref name="The Hindu">{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article832511.ece|title=Centre orders probe into CWG issues|work=The Hindu |location=India|date=16 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010|first=J.|last=Balaji| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017141103/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article832511.ece| archivedate= 17 October 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref> The [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports|Indian Sports Ministry]] has directed the Organising Committee of the 2010 Commonwealth Games (led by Suresh Kalmadi), to not release any staffer from their positions till the probe committee's work is finished.

==Legacy==
One of the aims of hosting the Commonwealth Games was to build world-class athletics infrastructure within the country, expose audiences to top-level non-cricket competition and encourage the youth to "Come out and play" (the official theme of the games).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgdelhi2010.org/come_out_and_play |title=Come Out and Play &#124; XIX Commonwealth Games 2010 Delhi |publisher=Cwgdelhi2010.org |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref> Building a sporting culture that looks beyond cricket is seen as an important task for a country which won its first ever [[India at the 2008 Summer Olympics|individual Olympic gold medal]] in [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing 2008]], despite having the world's second-largest population.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/gordonfarquhar/2010/10/sporting_legacy_for_india.html|date=14 October 2010|publisher=BBC |title=Will India take next steps to secure sporting legacy?| accessdate=14 January 2011 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110125061611/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/gordonfarquhar/2010/10/sporting_legacy_for_india.html| archivedate= 25 January 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref>

[[Sebastian Coe]], former Olympic gold medalist and chairman of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] [[London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games|Organising Committee]], was at the stadium during the 4 × 400 m women's relay and described the audience's cheers for the racers as "potentially the moment that could change the course of athletics in Asia, the moment that could inspire thousands of people who'd never even seen an athletics track before to get involved... To build a truly global capacity in sport, you have to take it round the world – out of your own backyard. That means taking risks and facing challenges, but it has to be done."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jamespearce/2010/10/did_delhi_live_up_to_expectati.html |title=Did Delhi live up to expectations? |last=Pearce |first=James|date=14 October 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 September 2012}}</ref>

==Dangal film==
[[Geeta Phogat]] was India's first female wrestler to win at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, where she won the gold medal ([[Wrestling at the 2010 Commonwealth Games – Women's freestyle 55 kg|55&nbsp;kg]]) while her sister [[Babita Kumari]] won the silver ([[Wrestling at the 2010 Commonwealth Games – Women's freestyle 51 kg|51&nbsp;kg]]). This came back in the 2016 Indian film ''[[Dangal (film)|Dangal]]''. Parts of the 2010 Commonwealth Games setting were rebuilt for the film.
