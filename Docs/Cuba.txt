'''Cuba''', officially the '''Republic of Cuba''' ({{Audio-es|República de Cuba|RCUB.ogg}}),<!--IPA:{{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðe ˈkuβa|}}--> is a unitary [[sovereign state]] comprising the island of Cuba as well as [[Isla de la Juventud]] and several minor [[archipelagos]]. Cuba is located in the northern [[Caribbean]] where the [[Caribbean Sea]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] meet. It is south of [[Florida]] and [[the Bahamas]], west of [[Haiti]] and north of [[Jamaica]]. [[Havana]] is the largest city and capital; other major cities include [[Santiago de Cuba]] and [[Camagüey]]. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of {{convert|109,884|km2|sqmi}}, and the second-most populous after [[Hispaniola]], with over 11 million inhabitants.<ref name = "BBC profile">{{cite web |title= Cuba profile: Facts |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19583446 |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= March 26, 2013 }}</ref>

Prior to Spanish colonization in the late 15th century, Cuba was inhabited by [[Amerindian]] tribes. It remained a colony of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] until the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898, which led to [[Platt Amendment|nominal independence]] as a ''de facto'' [[United States]] protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, Cuba attempted to [[Cuban Constitution of 1940|strengthen its democratic system]], but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in the dictatorship of [[Fulgencio Batista]] in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/JFK+Pre-Pres/1960/002PREPRES12SPEECHES_60OCT06b.htm |title=Remarks of Senator John F.

{{Main|History of Cuba|Timeline of Cuban history}}

===Prehistory===
[[File:Hatuey monument, Baracoa, Cuba.JPG|left|thumb|upright|[[Hatuey]], an early [[Taíno]] chief of Cuba]]
Before the arrival of the Spanish, Cuba was inhabited by three distinct tribes of [[Indigenous of the Americas|American Indian]] people. The [[Taíno people|Taíno]] (an [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] people), the [[Guanajatabey]], and the [[Ciboney people]].

The ancestors of the Ciboney migrated from the mainland of South America, with the earliest sites dated to 5,000 BP.<ref name="AnAofPCC">{{Cite book|title=Art and archaeology of pre-Columbian Cuba|page=22|year=1996|author=Ramón Dacal Moure, Manuel Rivero de la Calle|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=0-8229-3955-X|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PEE9oipDYksC&pg=PA22}}</ref>

The Taíno arrived from [[Hispanola]] sometime in the 3rd century A.D. When Columbus arrived they were the dominant culture in Cuba, having an estimated population of 150,000.<ref name="AnAofPCC"/>

The name "Cuba" comes from the native Taíno language. It is derived from either ''coabana'' meaning "great place," or from ''cubao'' meaning "where fertile land is abundant".<ref>http://cubaguama.com/taino-indians-in-cuba-2/</ref><ref>http://tainomuseum.org/taino/</ref>

The Taíno were farmers, while the Ciboney were farmers as well as fishers and [[hunter-gatherer]]s.

Cuba developed slowly and, unlike the plantation islands of the Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in [[Barbados]]; 300,000 in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], both British colonies; and 450,000 in French [[Saint-Domingue]], which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.<ref name="drimmer">[http://www.jstor.org/stable/1919107?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Melvin Drimmer, "Reviewed Work: ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'' by Herbert S.

The [[Seven Years' War]], which erupted in 1754 across three continents, eventually arrived in the Spanish Caribbean. Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 [[Battle of Havana (1762)|a British expedition]] of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from [[Portsmouth]] to capture Cuba. The British arrived on June 6, and by August had Havana under [[siege]].<ref name="Siege">Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom (2nd edition)''. Chapter One.</ref> When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|George Keppel]], the 3rd [[Earl of Albemarle]], entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. They imported food, horses and other goods into the city, as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the under developed sugar plantations.<ref name="Siege"/>
[[File:LindsayCambridge.jpg|thumb|The [[British expedition against Cuba|British invasion and occupation of Havana]] in 1762]]

Though Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants, fearing a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Britain seized Havana, it signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Florida]] in exchange for Cuba. The French had recommended this to Spain, advising that declining to give up Florida could result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.<ref name="Siege"/> Many in Britain were disappointed, believing that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's other gains in the war]].

The real engine for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the [[Haitian Revolution]]. When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba, too, and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing "pearl of the Antilles" that Haiti had been before the revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution|last = Ferrer|first = Ada|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 1107029422|location = New York|pages = 5}}</ref> As the historian Ada Ferrer has written, "At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba.

[[File:Slaves Unloading Ice in Cuba 1832.jpg|thumb|left|[[Slavery|Slaves]] in Cuba unloading ice from Maine, {{circa|1832}}]]
Although a smaller proportion of the population of Cuba was enslaved, at times slaves arose in revolt. In 1812 the Aponte Slave Rebellion took place but it was suppressed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Matt D.|title=The 1813 Aponte Rebellion in Cuba and the Struggle against Atlantic Slavery|year=2006|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=0-8078-5772-6|page=320 pages}}</ref>

The population of Cuba in 1817 was 630,980, of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 [[free people of color]] (mixed-race), and 224,268 black slaves.<ref name = "Scheina 2003 352">{{Harvnb|Scheina|2003|p=352}}.</ref> This was a much higher proportion of free blacks to slaves than in [[Virginia]], for instance, or the other Caribbean islands. Historians such as Swedish Magnus Mõrner, who studied slavery in Latin America, found that manumissions increased when slave economies were in decline, as in 18th-century Cuba and early 19th-century Maryland of the United States.<ref name="drimmer"/><ref>Magnus Mõrner, ''Race Mixture in Latin America'', Boston, 1967, pp. 124-125</ref>

In part due to Cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by the 19th century, there had developed the practice of ''coartacion,'' or "buying oneself out of slavery," a "uniquely Cuban development," according to historian Herbert S. Klein.<ref>Herbert S. Klein, ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967, p. 196</ref> Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated urban industries "to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to Cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace Negro workers."<ref name="drimmer"/> A system of diversified agriculture, with small farms and fewer slaves, served to supply the cities with produce and other goods.<ref name="drimmer"/>

In the 1820s, when the rest of Spain's empire in [[Latin America]] rebelled and formed independent states, Cuba remained loyal. Its economy was based on serving the empire. By 1860, Cuba had 213,167 free people of color, 39% of its non-White population of 550,000.<ref name="drimmer"/> By contrast, Virginia with about the same number of blacks, had only 58,042 or 11% who were free; the rest were enslaved.<ref name="drimmer"/> In the antebellum years, Virginia discouraged manumissions after the [[Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion]] of 1831 and strengthened restrictions against free blacks, as did other southern states. In addition, there was a high demand for slaves, and Virginia planters sold many in the internal domestic slave trade, to be shipped or taken overland to the Deep South, which had greatly expanded its cotton production.

Full independence from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]]. De Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for a free Cuba. On December 27, 1868, he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military service.{{sfn|Chomsky|Carr|Smorkaloff|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr2hQkCIihMC&pg=PA115 115–7]}} The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the [[Ten Years' War]].

The Republic of Cuba is one of the world's last remaining [[socialism|socialist]] countries following the [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideology. The Constitution of 1976, which defined Cuba as a [[socialist republic]], was replaced by the Constitution of 1992, which is "guided by the ideas of [[José Martí]] and the political and social ideas of [[Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] and [[Lenin]]."<ref name=constitution>{{cite web |title= The Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, 1976 (as Amended to 2002) |url= http://www.constitutionnet.org/files/Cuba%20Constitution.pdf |publisher= National Assembly of People's Power |accessdate= August 18, 2012 }}<br />For discussion of the 1992 amendments, see {{Harvnb|Domínguez|2003}}.</ref> The constitution describes the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] as the "leading force of society and of the state".<ref name=constitution/>

The [[People's Supreme Court of Cuba|People's Supreme Court]] serves as Cuba's highest judicial branch of government. It is also the court of last resort for all appeals against the decisions of provincial courts.

Cuba's national legislature, the National Assembly of People's Power (''Asamblea Nacional de Poder Popular''), is the supreme organ of power; 609 members serve five-year terms.<ref name=constitution/> The assembly meets twice a year; between sessions legislative power is held by the 31 member Council of Ministers. Candidates for the Assembly are approved by public referendum. All Cuban citizens over 16 who have not been convicted of a criminal offense can vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cuba 1976 (rev. 2002)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Cuba_2002?lang=en#796|website=Constitue|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}</ref> Article 131 of the Constitution states that voting shall be "through free, equal and secret vote".<ref name=constitution/> Article 136 states: "In order for deputies or delegates to be considered elected they must get more than half the number of valid votes cast in the electoral districts".<ref name=constitution/>

No [[List of political parties in Cuba|political party]] is permitted to nominate candidates or campaign on the island, including the Communist Party.<ref>[http://sshl.ucsd.edu/collections/las/cuba/1990.html Cuba: Elections and Events 1991–2001] Latin American Election Statistics Home</ref> The Communist Party of Cuba has held six party congress meetings since 1975. In 2011, the party stated that there were 800,000 members, and representatives generally constitute at least half of the Councils of state and the National Assembly. The remaining positions are filled by candidates nominally without party affiliation. Other political parties campaign and raise finances internationally, while activity within Cuba by [[opposition to Fidel Castro|opposition groups]] is minimal.

In February 2013, Raúl Castro, current Cuban President, announced his resignation for 2018, that will end his current 5-year term, and hope to implement permanent term limits for future Cuban Presidents, including age limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/02/24/cuba-president-castro-parliament/1943365/ |title=Cuba's Raul Castro announces retirement in 5 years |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=February 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of Cuba|Municipalities of Cuba}}
The country is subdivided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud). These were formerly part of six larger historical provinces: Pinar del Río, Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camagüey and Oriente. The present subdivisions closely resemble those of the Spanish military provinces during the Cuban Wars of Independence, when the most troublesome areas were subdivided. The provinces are divided into municipalities.

The Cuban state claims to adhere to [[socialist]] principles in organizing its largely state-controlled [[planned economy]]. Most of the means of production are owned and run by the government and most of the labor force is employed by the state. Recent years have seen a trend toward more private sector employment. By 2006, public sector employment was 78% and private sector 22%, compared to 91.8% to 8.2% in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/OA-Cuba_Social_Policy_at_Crossroads-en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009163422/http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/OA-Cuba_Social_Policy_at_Crossroads-en.pdf|archivedate=October 9, 2007|title=Social Policy at the crossroads|format=PDF|publisher=oxfamamerica.org|accessdate=February 5, 2009}}</ref> Any firm wishing to hire a Cuban must pay the Cuban government, which in turn will pay the employee in Cuban pesos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/cuba/Cuba996-01.htm#P392_35421|title=Cuba's repressive machinery: Summary and recommendations|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=1999}}</ref> The average monthly wage as of July 2013 is 466 [[Cuban pesos]], which are worth about US$19.<ref name=moneytalk/>

Before Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Cuba was one of the most advanced and successful countries in Latin America.<ref name="pbs.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/e_precastro.html|title=American Experience - Fidel Castro - People & Events |publisher=PBS|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref> Cuba's capital, Havana, was a "glittering and dynamic city".<ref name="pbs.org"/> The country's economy in the early part of the century, fuelled by the sale of sugar to the United States, had grown wealthy. Cuba ranked 5th in the hemisphere in per capita income, 3rd in life expectancy, 2nd in per capita ownership of automobiles and telephones, and 1st in the number of television sets per inhabitant. Cuba's literacy rate, 76%, was the fourth highest in Latin America. Cuba also ranked 11th in the world in the number of doctors per capita. Several private clinics and hospitals provided services for the poor. Cuba's income distribution compared favorably with that of other Latin American societies. However, income inequality was a profound issue between city and countryside, especially between whites and blacks. Cubans lived in abysmal poverty in the countryside. A thriving middle class, according to PBS, held the promise of prosperity and social mobility.<ref name="pbs.org"/> According to Cuba historian Louis Perez of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, "Havana was then what Las Vegas has become."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/before-the-revolution-159682020/?no-ist|title=Before the Revolution|author=Natasha Geiling|work=Smithsonian|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref>

After the Cuban revolution and before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba depended on Moscow for substantial aid and sheltered markets for its exports. The removal of these subsidies sent the Cuban economy into a rapid depression known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]]. Cuba took limited free market-oriented measures to alleviate severe shortages of food, consumer goods, and services. These steps included allowing some self-employment in certain retail and light manufacturing sectors, the legalization of the use of the [[US dollar]] in business, and the encouragement of [[Tourism in Cuba|tourism]]. Cuba has developed a unique urban farm system (the ''[[organopónicos]]'') to compensate for the end of food imports from the Soviet Union. It's widely viewed that the [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. embargo]] which initiated as a result of discontent with nationalization of U.S.-citizen-held property and later perceived human rights violations hurts the Cuban economy.

The leadership of Cuba has called for reforms in the country's [[Agriculture in Cuba|agricultural system]]. In 2008, Raúl Castro began enacting agrarian reforms to boost food production, as at that time 80% of food was imported. The reforms enacted are aimed at expanding land usage and increasing efficiency.<ref name=food>{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/04/16/cuba.farming/index.html|title=Cuban leader looks to boost food production|publisher=CNN|date=April 17, 2008|accessdate=September 14, 2009}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Cuba}}
[[File:Cuba rel94.jpg|thumb|A general map of Cuba]]
Cuba is an [[archipelago]] of islands located in the northern [[Caribbean Sea]] at the confluence with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[24th parallel north|24°N]], and longitudes [[74th meridian west|74°]] and [[85th meridian west|85°W]]. The United States lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) across the [[Straits of Florida]] to the north and northwest (to the closest tip of [[Key West, Florida]]), and [[the Bahamas]] 21&nbsp;km (13&nbsp;mi) to the north. [[Mexico]] lies 210 kilometers (130 miles) across the [[Yucatán Channel]] to the west (to the closest tip of [[Cabo Catoche]] in the State of [[Quintana Roo]]).

[[Haiti]] is 77&nbsp;km (48&nbsp;mi) to the east, [[Jamaica]] (140&nbsp;km/87&nbsp;mi) and the [[Cayman Islands]] to the south. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the [[Colorados Archipelago]] on the northwestern coast, the [[Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago]] on the north-central Atlantic coast, the [[Jardines de la Reina]] on the south-central coast and the [[Canarreos Archipelago]] on the southwestern coast.

[[File:Sierra Maestra panorama1.jpg|thumb|[[Sierra Maestra]] ]] 
The main island named Cuba is {{convert|1250|km|abbr=on}} long, constituting most of the nation's land area ({{convert|104556|km2|abbr=on|0}}) and is the largest island in the [[Caribbean]] and [[List of islands by area|17th-largest island]] in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is [[Pico Turquino]] ({{convert|1974|m|abbr=on}}).

The second-largest island is [[Isla de la Juventud]] (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of {{convert|2200|km2|abbr=on|0}}. Cuba has an official area (land area) of {{convert|109884|km2|abbr=on|0}}. Its area is {{convert|110860|km2|abbr=on|0}} including coastal and territorial waters.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Cuba}}
[[File:Valle vinales 1.jpg|thumb|[[Viñales Valley]] ]]
With most of the island south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than Hong Kong, which is at around the same latitude as Cuba, but has a subtropical climate instead of a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is {{convert|21|°C|1}} in January and {{convert|27|°C|1}} in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] combine to make the country prone to frequent [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]]. These are most common in September and October.

===Biodiversity===
Cuba signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on June 12, 1992, and became a party to the convention on March 8, 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/ |title=List of Parties |work=cbd.int}}</ref> It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], with one revision which was received by the convention on January 24, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/cu/cu-nbsap-v2-es.pdf |title=Plan de Acci&oacute;n Nacional 2006/2010 sobre la Diversidad Biol&oacute;gica. Rep&uacute;blica de Cuba |work=cbd.int}}</ref>

The revision comprises an action plan with time limits for each item, and an indication of the governmental body responsible for delivery. There is, however, virtually no information in that document about biodiversity itself. The country's fourth national report to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]], however, contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of each kingdom of life recorded from Cuba, the main groups being: [[animal]]s (17,801 species), [[bacteria]] (270 species), [[chromista]] (707 species), [[fungi]], including [[lichen]]-forming species (5844 species), [[plant]]s (9107 species) and [[protozoa]] (1440 species).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/cu/cu-nr-04-es.pdf |title=IV Informe Nacional al Convento sobre la Diversidad Biol&oacute;gica. Rep&uacute;blica de Cuba. 2009 |work=cbd.int}}</ref>

As elsewhere in the world, vertebrate animals and flowering plants are well documented. The numbers recorded from Cuba for those groups are therefore likely to be close to the numbers which actually occur in Cuba. For most if not all of the other groups, however, the true numbers of species occurring in Cuba are likely to exceed, often considerably, the numbers of those recorded so far.

According to the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women.<ref name="cubacensus2010">{{cite web |url=http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/cepde/anuario_2010/anuario_demografico_2010.pdf |title=ANUARIO DEMOGRAFICO DE CUBA 2010 |publisher=Oficina Nacional de Estadisticas}}</ref> Its [[birth rate]] (9.88 births per thousand population in 2006)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&subsection=Americas&month=May2007&file=World_News2007051741913.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222652/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&subsection=Americas&month=May2007&file=World_News2007051741913.xml|archivedate=September 26, 2007 |title=Population, birth rate falling in Cuba: Official |publisher=The Peninsula On-line |date= |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref> is one of the lowest in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Although the country has grown by around 4 million people since 1961, the rate of increase had simultaneously began to fall during that period, and the population began to decline in 2006, with a fertility rate of 1.43 children per woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.periodico26.cu/english/features/june2008/cuba-population060508.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113074404/http://www.periodico26.cu/english/features/june2008/cuba-population060508.html|archivedate=January 13, 2009 |title=Population Decrease Must be Reverted |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

Indeed, this drop in fertility is among the largest in the Western Hemisphere,<ref>{{cite web|year=1997|url=http://www.un.org/esa/population/pubsarchive/fer/ffer.htm|title=United Nations World Fertility Patterns 1997|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=July 9, 2006}}</ref> and is attributed largely to unrestricted access to legal abortion: Cuba's abortion rate was 58.6 per 1000 pregnancies in 1996, compared to an average of 35 in the Caribbean, 27 in Latin America overall, and 48 in Europe. Similarly, the use of contraceptives is also widespread, estimated at 79% of the female population (in the upper third of countries in the Western Hemisphere).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/25s3099.html|title=The Incidence of Abortion Worldwide|author1=Stanley K.

===Ethnoracial groups===
Cuba's population is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins. Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread, and subsequently there is a discrepancy regarding the country's racial composition: whereas the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami determined that 62% of Cubans are black,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821113550/http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html|archivedate=August 21, 2013|title=A barrier for Cuba's blacks|publisher=Miami Herald}}</ref> the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population, 65.05%, was white.

[[File:La Havane-Ecolières en uniforme.jpg|thumb|left|Young children in school uniforms]]

In fact, the [[Minority Rights Group International]] determined that "An objective assessment of the situation of Afro-Cubans remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution. Estimates of the percentage of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously, ranging from 34% to 62%".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49749d342c.html|title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Cuba: Afro-Cubans}}</ref>

===Immigration and emigration===
{{Main|Spanish immigration to Cuba}}
Immigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cuba's demographic profile. Between the 18th and early 20th century, large waves of [[Canarian people|Canarian]], [[Catalans|Catalan]], [[Andalusians|Andalusian]], [[Galician people|Galician]], and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba. Between 1899-1930 alone, close to a million Spaniards entered the country, though many would eventually return to Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm |title=La inmigración entre 1902 y 1920 |publisher=Tau.ac.il |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090606060146/http://www.tau.ac.il:80/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2009 }}</ref> Other prominent immigrant groups included French,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubagenweb.org/french/index.htm#refugees |title=Etat des propriétés rurales appartenant à des Français dans l'île de Cuba |publisher=Cuban Genealogy Center |date=July 10, 2007 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref> [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[British people|British]], and [[Irish people|Irish]], as well as small number of descendants of U.S. citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Post-revolution Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration, which has led to a [[Cuban exile|large and influential diaspora community]]. During the three decades after January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social classes — constituting 10% of the total population — [[Cuban migration to Miami|emigrated to the United States]], a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the U.S. from the Caribbean as a whole during that period.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://immigration-online.org/77-cuban-immigration.html |title=Cuban immigration – North American Immigration |publisher=Immigration-online.org |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name = "Pedraza 2007 ?">{{Harvnb|Pedraza|2007|p=?}}.</ref><ref name = "Falk 1988 74">{{Harvnb|Falk|1988|p=74}}: "[A] tenth of the entire Caribbean population has .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Cuba}}
[[File:2012-Catedral de San Cristobal anagoria 01.JPG|thumb|[[Havana Cathedral]] ]]
In 2010, the religious affiliation of the country was estimated by the [[Pew Forum]] to be 65% Christian (60% [[Roman Catholic]] or about 6.9 million in 2016, 5% [[Evangelical]] [[Protestant]] or about 575,000 in 2016), 23% unaffiliated, 17% [[folk religion]] (such as [[santería]]), and the remaining 0.4% consisting of other religions.<ref name=pewrel>{{cite web|title=Religious Composition by Country|url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/globalReligion-tables.pdf|work=Global Religious Landscape|publisher=Pew Forum|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}</ref>

In recent decades Cuba has seen a rapid growth of [[Evangelical]] [[Protestants]]: "Cuba’s Christians have thrived despite the island’s politics and poverty. Their improbable, decades-long revival is often described as being rivaled only by China’s. “It’s incredible. People just come on their own, looking for God,” says a Western Baptist leader."  <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2015/november/will-success-spoil-cuba-revival-havana-us-embargo.html?share=sWB%2ftrGdBkDqJGldddmS3gYj1MfMoyag|title=Will success spoil Cuba's Revival?|work=Christianity Today October 26, 2015|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}</ref>

Cuba is officially a secular state. Religious freedom increased through the 1980s,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1996|p=105}}: "The expansion of religious liberty began more than a decade ago, for example, and Cuban citizens, by and large, are free to practice their faiths without fear of persecution."</ref> with the government amending the constitution in 1992 to drop the state's characterization as atheistic.<ref name = "Domínguez 2003 4">{{Harvnb|Domínguez|2003|p=4}}.</ref>

[[Roman Catholicism]] is the largest religion, with its origins rooted in Spanish colonization. Despite less than half of the population identifying as Catholics in 2006, it nonetheless remains the dominant faith.<ref name=catholic>{{cite web|url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/033106/033106o.php|title=Catholic church in Cuba strives to re-establish the faith|author=David Einhorn|publisher=National Catholic Reporter|date=March 31, 2006|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}</ref> Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in 1998 and 2011, respectively, and Pope Francis visited Cuba in September 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/21/pope-francis-in-cuba-pontiff-to-hold-mass-in-holguins-revolution-square-live|title=Pope Francis in Cuba: pontiff arrives in Santiago - as it happened|last=Woolf|first=Nicky|last2=Am|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-03-21|last3=Holpuch|first3=a|last4=York|first4=Angela Bruno in New|last5=Havana|first5=with Jonathan Watts in|last6=Rome|first6=Stephanie Kirchgaessner in}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cuba to Free 3,500 Prisoners Ahead of Pope Visit|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/cuba-pope-francis-visit-prisoners-amnesty/2959896.html|website=voanews.com|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref> Prior to each papal visit, the Cuban government pardoned prisoners as a humanitarian gesture.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Miroff|first1=Nick|title=Cuba pardons more than 3,500 prisoners ahead of Pope Francis visit|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/cuba-pardons-more-than-3500-prisoners-ahead-of-pope-francis-visit/2015/09/11/5e1c1f27-ab63-444f-98ca-fff75cb92d3b_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 11, 2015|date=September 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Harriett|title=Cuba pardons 3,522 prisoners ahead of Pope Francis visit|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/cuba/11858266/Cuba-pardons-3522-prisoners-ahead-of-Pope-Francis-visit.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>

The religious landscape of Cuba is also strongly defined by [[syncretisms]] of various kinds. Christianity is often practiced in tandem with [[Santería]], a mixture of Catholicism and mostly African faiths, which include a number of cults. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (the Virgin of ''Cobre'') is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and a symbol of Cuban culture. In Santería, she has been syncretized with the goddess [[Oshun]].

Cuba also hosts small communities of [[Jews]] (500 in 2012), [[Muslims]], and members of the [[Bahá'í]] Faith.<ref>{{cite web|date=June 13, 2005|url=http://news.bahai.org/story.cfm?storyid=377|title=Government officials visit Baha'i center|publisher=Baha'iWorldNewsService.com}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Cuba}} 
[[File:Casa de la Trova Santiago Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|A local musical house, Casa de la Trova in Santiago de Cuba]]
Cuban culture is influenced by its melting pot of cultures, primarily those of Spain and Africa. After the 1959 revolution, the government started a national literacy campaign, offered free education to all and established rigorous sports, ballet and music programs.<ref name=hsas>{{cite news|title=For Cuba, a Harsh Self-Assessment|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/world/americas/harsh-self-assessment-as-cuba-looks-within.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0&ref=world|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=July 24, 2013}}</ref>

{{Main|Music of Cuba}}
Cuban music is very rich and is the most commonly known expression of culture. The central form of this music is [[Son (music)|Son]], which has been the basis of many other musical styles like [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Cuban Rumba|rumba]] and [[Mambo (music)|mambo]] and an upbeat derivation of the rumba, the [[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-cha]]. Rumba music originated in early Afro-Cuban culture.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robin|title=Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and Artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920–1940|year=1997|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=0-8229-5645-4}}</ref>  The [[Tres (musical instrument)|Tres]] was also invented in Cuba, but other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, [[Neo-Taíno nations|Taíno]] origin, or both, such as the [[maraca]]s, [[güiro]], [[marimba]] and various wooden drums including the [[mayohuacan]].

Popular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Havana was the heart of the [[rap]] scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s.

During that time, [[reggaetón]] was growing in popularity. In 2011, the Cuban state denounced reggaeton as degenerate, directed reduced "low-profile" airplay of the genre (but did not ban it entirely) and banned the megahit ''Chupi Chupi'' by [[Osmani García]], characterizing its description of sex as "the sort which a prostitute would carry out".<ref>{{cite web|author=Victor Kaonga, Malawi |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/07/cuba-reggaeton-hit-chupi-chupi-denounced-by-authorities/ |title=Cuba: Reggaeton Hit 'Chupi Chupi' Denounced by Authorities |publisher=Global Voices |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref> In December 2012, the Cuban government officially banned sexually explicit reggaeton songs and music videos from radio and television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Shetler |url=http://popcrush.com/cuban-government-censor-reggaeton-sexually-explicit/ |title=Cuban Government to Censor Reggaeton For Being "Sexually Explict" |publisher=Popcrush.com |date=December 7, 2012 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/cuba-bans-reggaeton-sexually-explicit-songs/story?id=17888666#.UMJho3ewWSq |title=Cuban Government Censors Reggaeton and "Sexually Explicit" Songs |publisher=ABC News |date=December 6, 2012 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuban cuisine}}
[[File:Cubanfood.jpg|thumb|A traditional meal of ''ropa vieja'' (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer]]
[[File:La Havane (1) Tamales pliés.jpg|thumb|Cuban-style tamales]]
Cuban cuisine is a fusion of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alvarez|2001}}.</ref> The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.

The typical meal could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ''[[ropa vieja]]'' (shredded beef), [[Cuban bread]], pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans and rice, referred to as ''[[Moros y Cristianos]]'' (or ''moros'' for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant spices.

===Literature===
{{Main|Cuban literature}}
Cuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by José Martí, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as [[Nicolás Guillén]] and [[Jose Z. Tallet]] focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of [[Dulce María Loynaz]] and [[José Lezama Lima]] have been influential. Romanticist [[Miguel Barnet]], who wrote ''Everyone Dreamed of Cuba'', reflects a more melancholy Cuba.<ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20070214100357/http://www.tobias-hauser.de/vortraege/?cmd=en Costa Rica – Journey into the Tropical Garden of Eden], Tobias Hauser.{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}}</ref>

Writers such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]], [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], and more recently [[Daína Chaviano]], [[Pedro Juan Gutiérrez]], [[Zoé Valdés]], [[Guillermo Rosales]] and [[Leonardo Padura]] have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities.

Due to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports which are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally promoted in other Latin American nations. [[Baseball in Cuba|Baseball]] is by far the most popular; other sports and pastimes include [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[cricket]], and [[track and field athletics|athletics]]. Cuba is a dominant force in [[amateur boxing]], consistently achieving high medal tallies in major international competitions. Cuba also provides a [[Cuba at the Olympics|national team]] that competes in the [[Olympic Games]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/cuba |title=Cuba &#124; Comité Olímpico Cubano &#124; National Olympic Committee |publisher=Olympic.org |date= |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref>

The Cuban Ministry of Higher Education operates a scheme of distance education which provides regular afternoon and evening courses in rural areas for agricultural workers.
