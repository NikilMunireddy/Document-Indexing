The '''Crusades''' were a series of intermittent Papal sanctioned military campaigns beginning in the late 11th-century. They commenced with a call to arms by [[Pope Urban II]] who was responding to a request for military support for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Byzantine Emperor, [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], needed military reinforcements for the conflict with the westward migrating [[Turkic migration#Turkmens|Turks]] in [[Anatolia]]. Historians debate Urban and the Crusader’s primary motivations. One of Urban's stated aims was to guarantee pilgrims access to the holy sites in the [[Holy Land]] that were under Muslim control while his wider strategy may have been to establish himself as head of the united Church and bringing together the Eastern and Western branches of Christendom that had been divided since [[East–West Schism|their split in 1054]]. What is known though is the unprecedented response to Urban’s preaching and the basis it established for later crusades. Hundreds of thousands of people from many different classes across Western Europe became crusaders by taking a public vow and receiving [[indulgence|plenary indulgences]] from the church. Some were peasants hoping for [[Divinization (Christian)|Apotheosis]] at [[Jerusalem]]. Urban preached that anyone who participated would be forgiven by [[God in Christianity|God]] of all their sins. In addition some historians argue that participation satisfied feudal obligations and provided opportunities for economic and political gain.

Opinions concerning the conduct of Crusaders [[Crusades#Historiography|have varied]] from laudatory to highly critical. Crusaders often pillaged the countries through which they traveled, and contrary to their promises the leaders retained much of this territory rather than returning it to the Byzantines. The [[People's Crusade]] prompted the murder of thousands of Jews, known as the [[Rhineland massacres]]. Constantinople was [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacked]] during the [[Fourth Crusade]], rendering the reunification of Christendom impossible.

The impact of the Crusades was profound; they reopened the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to commerce and travel, enabling [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to flourish. The Crusades consolidated the collective identity of the Latin Church under papal leadership, and were a source of heroism, [[chivalry]], and piety. This consequently spawned medieval romance, philosophy, and literature. However, the Crusades reinforced the connection between Western Christendom, [[feudalism]], and [[militarism]].

==Terminology==

''[[:wikt:crusade|Crusade]]'' is a modern term derived from the French ''croisade'' and Spanish ''cruzada''; by 1750, forms of the word "crusade" had established themselves in English, French, and German.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=258}}</ref> The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records its first use in English in 1757 by William Shenstone.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hindley|2004|pp=2–3}}</ref> When a crusader swore a vow (''votus'') to reach Jerusalem, they received a cloth cross (''crux'') to be sewn on their clothing. This "taking of the cross" became associated with the entire journey, and crusaders saw themselves as undertaking an ''iter'' (journey) or ''peregrinatio'' (armed [[pilgrimage]]). The inspiration for this "[[messianism]] of the poor" was an expected mass [[Divinization (Christian)|apotheosis]] at Jerusalem.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cohn|1970|pp=61, 64}}</ref>

The ''numbering of the Crusades'' is debated, with some historians counting seven major Crusades and a number of minor ones from 1096 to 1291.<ref name="Davies 1997, p. 358">{{Harvnb|Davies|1997|p=358}}</ref> Others consider the [[Fifth Crusade]] of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] as two crusades, making the crusade launched by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1270 the [[Eighth Crusade]]. Sometimes the Eighth Crusade is considered two, the second of which is the [[Ninth Crusade]].

In the pluralistic view of the Crusades developed during the 20th century, "Crusade" encompasses all papal-sanctioned military campaigns in [[Southwestern Asia]] or in Europe.<ref name="Lock 2006 270">{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=270}}</ref> A key distinction between the Crusades and other holy wars was that the authorization for the Crusades came directly from the pope, who claimed to be working on behalf of Christ.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2009|p=27}}</ref> This takes into account the view of the Roman Catholic Church and medieval contemporaries, such as Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], which gives equal precedence to military campaigns undertaken for political reasons and to combat [[paganism]] and [[heresy]]. This broad definition includes the [[Albigensian Crusade|persecution of heretics in Southern France]], the [[Aragonese Crusade|political conflict between Christians in Sicily]], the [[Reconquista|Christian re-conquest of Iberia]], [[Hussite Wars]], and the [[Northern Crusades|conquest of pagans in the Baltic]].<ref name="Davies 1997, pp. 362–364">{{Harvnb|Davies|1997|pp=362–364}}</ref> A narrower view is that the Crusades were a defensive war in the [[Levant]] against Muslims to free the Holy Land from Muslim rule.<ref name="Madden 2005 xii, 4, 8">{{Harvnb| Madden |2005 |pp= xii, 4, 8}}</ref>

Popes periodically declared political crusades as a means of conflict resolution among Roman Catholics; the first of these was declared by Pope Innocent III against [[Markward of Anweiler]] in 1202.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=255–256}}</ref> Others include a crusade against the [[Stedingen|Stedingers]], several (declared by a number of popes) against Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and his sons,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=172–180}}</ref> and two crusades against opponents of King [[Henry III of England]] who received the same privileges as participants in the Fifth Crusade.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=167}}</ref>

A common term for [[Muslim]] was ''[[Saracen]]''; before the 16th century, the words "Muslim" and "Islam" were rarely used by Europeans.<ref name="Tolan2002xv">{{Harvnb|Tolan|2002|p=xv}}</ref> In Greek and Latin, "Saracen" originated in the early first millennium to refer to non-[[Arab people]]s inhabiting the desert areas around the [[Arabia Petraea|Roman province of Arabia]].<ref name="Daniel197953">{{Harvnb|Daniel|1979|p=53}}</ref><ref name="Retso505">{{Harvnb|Retso|2003|pp=505–506}}</ref> The term evolved to include [[Arab tribes]], and by the 12th century it was an ethnic and religious marker synonymous with "Muslim" in [[Medieval Latin]] literature.<ref name="Kahf 81">{{Harvnb|Kahf|1999|p=81}}</ref><ref name="Retso">{{Harvnb|Retso|2003|p=96}}</ref> ''Frank'' and ''[[Latins#Middle Ages|Latin]]'' were used during the Crusades for Western Europeans, distinguishing them from ''Greeks''.<ref>{{OED|Frank}}</ref><ref>{{OED|Latin}}</ref>

==Historiography==
{{Further|Historiography of the Crusades}}

[[File:CouncilofClermont.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of a large group of men in a room with many statues|Illumination from the ''Livre des Passages d'Outre-mer'' (c. 1490) of Urban II at the Council of Clermont (from the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]])]] Five major sources of information exist on the [[Council of Clermont]] that led to the First Crusade: the anonymous ''[[Gesta Francorum]]'' (''The Deeds of the Franks'', dated about 1100–1101); [[Fulcher of Chartres]], who attended the council; [[Robert the Monk]], who may have been present, and [[Baldric, archbishop of Dol]] and [[Guibert de Nogent]] (who were not). The accounts, written retrospectively, differ greatly.<ref>{{Harvnb| Strack |2012|pp=30–45}}</ref> In his 1106–07 ''Historia Iherosolimitana'', Robert the Monk wrote that Urban asked western Roman Catholic Christians to aid the Orthodox Byzantine Empire because "''[[Deus vult]]''" ("God wills it") and promised [[absolution]] to participants; according to other sources, the pope promised an [[indulgence]]. In the accounts, Urban emphasizes reconquering the Holy Land more than aiding the emperor and lists gruesome offences allegedly committed by Muslims. The crusade was preached across France; Urban wrote to those "waiting in [[Flanders]]" that the Turks, in addition to ravaging the "churches of God in the eastern regions", seized "the Holy City of Christ, embellished by his passion and resurrection—and blasphemy to say it—have sold her and her churches into abominable slavery". Although the pope did not explicitly call for the reconquest of Jerusalem, he called for military "liberation" of the [[Eastern Churches]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Riley-SmithRiley-Smith|1981 |p=38 }}</ref>

During the 16th-century [[Reformation]] and [[Counter-Reformation]], historians saw the Crusades through the lens of their own religious beliefs. [[Protestantism|Protestants]] saw them as a manifestation of the evils of the [[papacy]], and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] viewed them as forces for good.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=257}}</ref> [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] historians tended to view the [[Middle Ages]] in general, and the Crusades in particular, as the efforts of barbarian cultures driven by fanaticism.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=259}}</ref> By the early [[Romanticism|Romantic period]] in the 19th century, that harsh view of the Crusades and their era had softened;<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=261}}</ref> scholarship later in the century emphasised specialisation and detail.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=266}}</ref>

Eighteenth-century Enlightenment scholars and modern Western historians have expressed moral outrage at the conduct of the crusaders. [[Steven Runciman]] wrote during the 1950s, "High ideals were besmirched by cruelty and greed&nbsp;... the Holy War was nothing more than a long act of intolerance in the name of God".<ref name="Runciman 1951 480">{{Harvnb|Runciman|1951|p=480}}</ref> The 20th century produced three important histories of the Crusades: by Runciman, [[Rene Grousset]] and a multi-author work edited by K. M. Stetton.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=269}}</ref> During that century, two definitions of the Crusades developed; one includes all papal-led efforts in Western Asia and Europe,<ref name="Lock 2006 270"/> but historian [[Thomas Madden]] wrote: "The crusade, first and foremost, was a war against Muslims for the defense of the Christian faith&nbsp;.... They began as a result of a Muslim conquest of Christian territories." Madden wrote that the goal of Pope Urban was that "[t]he Christians of the East must be free from the brutal and humiliating conditions of Muslim rule."<ref name="Madden 2005 xii, 4, 8"/>

After the 1291 fall of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], European support for the Crusades continued despite criticism by contemporaries (such as [[Roger Bacon]], who believed them ineffective: "Those who survive, together with their children, are more and more embittered against the Christian faith").<ref>{{Harvnb|Rose|2009|p=72}}</ref> According to historian Norman Davies, the Crusades contradicted the [[Peace and Truce of God]] supported by Urban and reinforced the connection between Western Christendom, [[feudalism]], and [[militarism]]. The formation of military religious orders scandalised the Orthodox Byzantines, and crusaders pillaged countries they crossed on their journey east. Violating their oath to restore land to the Byzantines, they often kept the land for themselves.<ref>{{Harvnb| Kolbaba |2000|p=49}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb| Vasilev |1952|p=408}}</ref> The early [[People's Crusade]] instigated a [[pogrom]] in the Rhineland and the massacre of thousands of Jews in Central Europe. The Fourth Crusade resulted in the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|sacking of Constantinople]], effectively ending any chance of reconciling the [[East–West Schism]] and leading to the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Ottomans. Enlightenment historians criticized the Crusades' misdirection—that of the Fourth in particular, which attacked a Christian power (the Byzantine Empire) instead of Islam. David Nicolle called the Fourth Crusade controversial in its "betrayal" of Byzantium,<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicolle|2011|p=5}}</ref> and in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' [[Edward Gibbon]] wrote that the crusaders' efforts would have been more effective improving their own countries.<ref name="Davies 1997, p. 358"/>

In the seventh and eighth centuries, Islam was introduced in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] by the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and a new unified polity. This led to a rapid expansion of Arab power, the influence of which stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], [[southern Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].<ref>{{Harvnb| Wickham|2009|p=280}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=4}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=14}}</ref> Tolerance, trade, and political relationships between the Arabs and the Christian states of Europe ebbed and flowed.

Although he left a growing treasury, he neglected domestic affairs and ignored the cost of incorporating his conquests into the Byzantine ''[[ecumene]]''. None of Basil’s successors were militarily or politically talented, and the task of governing the Empire increasingly devolved to the civil service. Their efforts to spend the Byzantine economy back into prosperity triggered [[inflation]]. To balance an increasingly unstable budget, Basil’s standing army was dismissed and his ''[[Theme (Byzantine district)|thematic]]'' troops replaced the ''[[Tagma (military)|tagmata]]''. In Europe, the Germans were expanded at the expense of the [[Slavs]]<ref>{{Harvnb| Housley |2006|p=31}}</ref> and [[Sicily]] was conquered by [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger De Hauteville]] in 1091.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mayer|1988|pp=17–18}}</ref>

An aggressive, reformist papacy clashed with the Eastern Empire and Western secular monarchs, leading to the 1054 [[East–West Schism]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Mayer |1988|pp=2–3}}</ref> and the [[Investiture Controversy]] (which began around 1075 and continued during the First Crusade). The papacy began to assert its independence from secular rulers, marshaling arguments for the proper use of armed force by Catholics. The result was intense piety, an interest in religious affairs, and religious propaganda advocating a [[Just war theory|just war]] to reclaim Palestine from the Muslims. The majority view was that non-Christians could not be forced to accept Christian baptism or be physically assaulted for having a different faith, although a minority believed that vengeance and forcible conversion were justified for the denial of Christian faith and government.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2009|pp=10–11}}</ref> Participation in such a war was seen as a form of [[penance]] which could counterbalance sin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=8–10}}</ref>

The status quo was disrupted by the western migrating Turks.  In 1071 they defeated the Byzantine army at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] and the rapidly-expanding [[Great Seljuk Empire]] gained nearly all of [[Anatolia]] while the empire descended into frequent civil wars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Asbridge|2011|p=97}}</ref> One year later the Turks wrested control of Palestine from the [[Fatimids]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Hindley|2004|p=15}}</ref> The disruption of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]]s by the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Turks]] prompted support for the Crusades in Western Europe.<ref name = TolanVeinsteinHenry>{{harvnb| TolanVeinsteinHenry |2013|p=37}}</ref>

[[File:Seljuk Empire locator map.svg|thumb|alt=Map of the Middle East, from the Mediterranean east of the Caspian Sea|The [[Great Seljuk Empire]] at its greatest extent (1092)]]

In 1095 at the [[Council of Piacenza]], [[Byzantine Emperors|Emperor]] [[Alexios I Komnenos]] requested military aid from Urban II to fight the Turks, probably in the form of mercenary reinforcements and it is also likely he exaggerated the danger facing the Eastern Empire in making his appeal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mayer|1988|pp=6–7}}</ref> Later that year at the [[Council of Clermont]] Urban raised the issue again and preached for a crusade. Historian Paul Everett Pierson asserts that  Urban also hoped that aiding the Eastern Church would reunite it under his leadership.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Everett Pierson|title=The Dynamics of Christian Mission|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_OSJIyW7q2MC&pg=PA103|date= 2009|publisher=WCIU Press|page=103}}</ref>

Crusading became increasingly widespread in terms of geography and objectives. In France the [[Albigensian Crusade]] was launched against the [[Cathars]] and the [[County of Toulouse]]. Over the early decades of the century the Cathars were driven underground while the French monarchy asserted control over the region.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=163–165}}</ref> [[Andrew II of Hungary]] waged the [[Bosnian Crusade]] against the [[Bosnian church]] that was theologically Catholic but in long term schism with the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=172–173}}</ref> The conflict only ended with the [[Battle of Mohi|Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1241]]. In the Iberian peninsula Crusader privileges were given to those aiding the [[Knights Templar|Templars]],[[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]] and the Iberian orders that merged with the [[Order of Calatrava]] and the [[Order of Santiago]].  The papacy declared frequent Iberian crusades and from 1212 to 1265, the Christian kingdoms drove the Muslims back to the [[Emirate of Granada]], which held out until 1492 when the Muslims and Jews were expelled from the peninsula.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=211}}</ref>

Innocent III declared that a new crusade would begin in 1217, and summoned the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] in 1215. Most of the crusaders came from Germany, Flanders, and [[Frisia]], with a large army from Hungary led by Andrew II and additional forces led by Duke [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria|Leopold VI]]. Andrew and Leopold arrived in Acre in October 1217, but little was accomplished and Andrew returned to Hungary in January 1218. After the arrival of more crusaders, Leopold and king of Jerusalem [[John of Brienne]] laid siege to [[Damietta]] in Egypt;<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=168–169}}</ref> they captured it in November 1219.

After a November defeat at [[Gaza City|Gaza]], Theobald arranged two treaties, one with the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubids]] of [[Damascus]] and another with the Ayyubids of Egypt, which returned territory to the crusading states but caused disaffection among the crusaders. Theobald returned to Europe in September 1240; [[Richard of Cornwall]], younger brother of King [[Henry III of England]], took the cross and arrived in Acre a few weeks later. After enforcing Theobald's treaty, Richard left the Holy Land for Europe in May 1241.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=173–174}}</ref>

During the summer of 1244 a [[Khwārazm-Shāh dynasty|Khwarezmian]] force summoned by al-Kamil's son, [[al-Salih Ayyub]], stormed and took Jerusalem. The Franks allied with Ayyub's uncle [[As-Salih Ismail (Ayyubid emir)|Ismail]] and the [[Al-Mansur Ibrahim|emir of Homs]], and their combined forces went into battle at [[Battle of La Forbie|La Forbie]] in [[Gaza City|Gaza]].

According to Rothelin, [[continuator]] of [[William of Tyre|William of Tyre's]] ''History'', 20,000 men died in the conflict (when the crusader states were chronically short of soldiers).

In 1266 Louis IX' brother [[Charles I of Sicily|Charles]] seized Sicily, previously-controlled parts of the eastern [[Adriatic]], [[Corfu]], [[Butrint]]o, [[Vlorë|Avlona]], and [[Suboto]]. The [[Treaty of Viterbo]] was agreed with the exiled [[Baldwin II of Constantinople]] and [[William II Villehardouin]]; the heirs of both Latin princes would marry Charles' children, and if there were no heirs Charles would receive the empire and principality. Charles turned his brother's crusade to his own advantage, persuading Louis to direct the [[Eighth Crusade]] against Charles' rebel vassals in Tunis. Louis’ death, illness among the crusaders and a fleet-devastating storm forced Charles to postpone his designs on Constantinople. Michael VIII Palailogos was alarmed by Charles’ planned crusade to restore the Latin Empire, which had fallen in 1261, and Charles' expansion in the Mediterranean. Michael delayed Charles by beginning negotiations with [[Pope Gregory X]] for union of the Greek and the Latin churches. At the [[Second Council of Lyon]] a union of the churches was declared, with Charles and [[Philip of Courtenay]] compelled to form a truce with Byzantium. This union would later prove unacceptable to the Greeks. Michael also provided Genoa with funds to encourage revolt in Charles’ northern Italian territories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Baldwin|2014|p=}}</ref> In 1268 Charles executed [[Conradin]], great-grandson of [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]] and principal pretender to the throne of Jerusalem, when he seized Sicily from the Holy Roman Empire.

Edward learned of his father's death and his succession to the throne in December 1272, but he did not return to England until 1274 (although he accomplished little in the Holy Land).<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=164}}</ref> The [[Papal election, 1280–81|1281 election]] of a French pope, [[Pope Martin IV|Martin IV]], brought the full power of the papacy into line behind Charles. He campaigned unsuccessfully in Albania and [[Principality of Achaea|Achaea]] before preparing to launch his crusade (with 400 ships, carrying 27,000 mounted knights) against Constantinople. Michael VIII Palailogos allied with [[Peter III of Aragon]] to foment an uprising, the [[Sicilian Vespers]], during which the crusader fleet was abandoned and burnt. The Sicilians appealed to Peter, who was proclaimed king, and the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] was exiled from Sicily. Martin excommunicated Peter and called for a crusade against Aragon before Charles died in 1285, allowing [[Henry II of Cyprus]] to reclaim Jerusalem. One factor in the crusaders' decline was the disunity and conflict among Latin Christian interests in the eastern Mediterranean. Martin compromised the papacy by supporting Charles of Anjou, and botched secular "crusades" against Sicily and Aragon tarnished its spiritual lustre. The collapse of the papacy's [[moral authority]] and the rise of nationalism rang the death knell for crusading, ultimately leading to the [[Avignon Papacy]] and the [[Western Schism]]. The [[Aragonese Crusade|Crusade of Aragón]] was declared by Martin against Peter III in 1284 and 1285, with Peter supporting anti-Angevin forces in Sicily after the Sicilian Vespers and Martin supporting Charles of Anjou. [[Pope Boniface VIII]] proclaimed a crusade against [[Frederick III of Sicily]] (Peter's youngest son) in 1298, but was unable to prevent Frederick's coronation and recognition as king of Sicily.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=186}}</ref>

A number of crusades were launched during the 14th and 15th centuries to counter the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. The first, in 1396, was led by [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]], king of Hungary; many French nobles joined Sigismund's forces, including the crusade's military leader, [[John the Fearless]] (son of the Duke of Burgundy). Although Sigismund advised the crusaders to focus on defence when they reached the Danube, they besieged the city of [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nicopolis]]. The Ottomans defeated them in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] on 25 September, capturing 3,000 prisoners.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=200}}</ref>

The Hussite Crusades, also known as the [[Hussite Wars]], involved military action against the [[Bohemian Reformation]] in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] and the followers of early Czech [[Protestant Reformation|church reformer]] [[Jan Hus]], who was [[Death by burning|burned at the stake]] in 1415. Crusades were declared five times during that period: in 1420, 1421, 1422, 1427, and 1431. These expeditions forced the Hussite forces, who disagreed on many doctrinal points, to unite to drive out the invaders. The wars ended in 1436 with the ratification of the compromise [[Compacts of Basel]] by the Church and the Hussites.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=201–202}}</ref>

Polish-Hungarian King [[Władysław III of Poland|Władysław Warneńczyk]] invaded the recently conquered Ottoman territory, reaching Belgrade in January 1444; a negotiated truce was repudiated by Sultan [[Murad II]] within days of its ratification. Further efforts by the crusaders ended in the [[Battle of Varna]] on 10 November, a decisive Ottoman victory which led to the withdrawal of the crusaders. This withdrawal, following the last Western attempt to aid the Byzantine Empire, led to the 1453 fall of Constantinople. [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]] organized a 1456 crusade to lift the Ottomon siege of Belgrade.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=202–203}}</ref> In April 1487, [[Pope Innocent VIII]] called for a crusade against the [[Waldensians]] of [[Savoy]], the [[Piedmont]], and the [[Dauphiné]] in southern France and northern Italy.

==Crusader states==
[[File:LatinEmpire2.png|thumb|right|upright=1.3|alt=Multi-coloured map of present-day Greece and Turkey|The Latin and Byzantine Empires in 1205]]

The First Crusade established the first four crusader states in the Eastern Mediterranean: the [[County of Edessa]] (1098–1149), the [[Principality of Antioch]] (1098–1268), the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] (1099–1291), and the [[County of Tripoli]] (1104—although Tripoli was not conquered until 1109—to 1289). The [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] originated before the Crusades, but it received kingdom status from Pope Innocent III and later became fully Westernized by the [[House of Lusignan]]. According to historian [[Jonathan Riley-Smith]], these states were the first examples of "Europe overseas". They are generally known as ''outremer'', from the [[French language|French]] ''outre-mer'' ("overseas" in English).<ref>{{OED|Outremer}}</ref>

The Fourth Crusade established a [[Latin Empire]] in the east and allowed the partition of Byzantine territory by its participants. The Latin emperor controlled one-fourth of the Byzantine territory, Venice three-eighths (including three-eighths of the city of Constantinople), and the remainder was divided among the other crusade leaders. This began the period of [[History of Greece|Greek history]] known as ''Frankokratia'' or ''Latinokratia'' ("Frankish [or Latin] rule"), when Catholic Western European nobles—primarily from France and Italy—established states on former Byzantine territory and ruled over the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Byzantine Greeks]]. The ''[[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae]]'' is a valuable record of early-13th-century Byzantine administrative divisions (''[[episkepsis]]'') and family estates.<ref name="Runciman 1951 480"/>

==Finance==

Crusades were expensive; as the number of wars increased, their costs escalated. Pope Urban II called upon the rich to help First Crusade lords such as [[Robert Curthose|Duke Robert of Normandy]] and Count Raymond of St. Gilles, who subsidized knights in their armies. The total cost to King Louis IX of France of the 1284–1285 crusades was estimated at 1,537,570 ''livres'', six times the king's annual income. This may be conservative, since records indicate that Louis spent 1,000,000 ''livres'' in Palestine after his Egyptian campaign. Rulers demanded subsidies from their subjects,<ref>{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2009|pp=43–44}}</ref> and alms and bequests prompted by the conquest of Palestine were additional sources of income. The popes ordered that collection boxes be placed in churches and, beginning in the mid-twelfth century, granted indulgences in exchange for donations and bequests.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riley-Smith|2009|p=44}}</ref>

==Military orders==
{{Main|Military order (monastic society)}}
The military orders, especially the Templars and the Hospitallers,  played a major role in providing support for the Crusader States, for they provided decisive forces of highly trained and motivated soldiers at critical moments.<ref>Alfred J. Andrea, ''Encyclopedia of the Crusades'' (2003) pp. 213–15</ref>  The Hospitallers and the Templars became international organisations, with [[Regimental depot|depots]] across Western Europe and the East. The Teutonic Knights focused on the Baltic, and the Spanish military orders of Santiago, Calatrava, [[Order of Alcántara|Alcantara]], and [[Order of Montesa|Montesa]] concentrated on the Iberian Peninsula. The Hospitallers (Knights of the Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem) had been founded in Jerusalem before the First Crusade but greatly enlarged its mission once the Crusades began.<ref>Helen J. Nicholson, ''The Knights Hospitaller'' (2001).</ref> After the fall of Acre they relocated to Cyprus, conquering and ruling Rhodes (1309–1522) and Malta (1530–1798). The Poor Knights of Christ and its Temple of Solomon were founded in 1118 to protect pilgrims en route to Jerusalem. They became wealthy and powerful through banking and real estate. In 1322 the king of France suppressed the order, ostensibly for sodomy, magic and heresy but probably for financial and political reasons.<ref name="Davies 1997 359">{{Harvnb|Davies|1997|p=359}}</ref>

The [[Children's Crusade]] was said to have been a Catholic movement in France and Germany in 1212 who tried to reach the Holy Land. The traditional narrative is probably conflated from some factual and mythical notions of the period including visions by a French or German boy, an intention to peacefully convert Muslims in the Holy Land to Christianity, a band of several thousand youths set out for [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]], and children being sold into slavery.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zacour|1969|pp=325–342}}</ref> A study published in 1977 casts doubt on the existence of these events, and many historians came to believe that they were not (or not primarily) children but multiple bands of "wandering poor" in Germany and France, some of whom tried to reach the Holy Land and others who never intended to do so.<ref>{{Harvnb|Raedts|1977|pp=279–323}}</ref><ref>Russell, Oswald, "Children's Crusade", ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', 1989</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Bridge|1980}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Miccoli|1961|pp=407–443}}</ref>

Three crusading efforts were made by peasants during the mid-1250s and the early 14th century. The first, the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusade of 1251]], was preached in northern France. After a meeting with [[Blanche of Castile]], it became disorganized and was disbanded by the government.<ref name="Lock 2006 179">{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=179}}</ref> The second, in 1309, occurred in [[England]], northeastern France, and Germany; as many as 30,000 peasants arrived at [[Avignon]] before it was disbanded.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|pp=187–188}}</ref> The third, in [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]], became a series of attacks on clergy and Jews and was forcibly suppressed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lock|2006|p=190}}</ref> However, this "crusade" is primarily seen as a revolt against the French monarchy. The Jews had been allowed to return to France, after being expelled in 1306; any debts owed to the Jews before their expulsion were collected by the monarchy, drove the ''[[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|Pastoureaux]]'' (by which this movement is called).<ref>{{Harvnb|Tuchman|2011|p=41}}</ref>

Western Europeans in the East adopted native customs, saw themselves as citizens of their new home and intermarried.<ref>{{Harvnb|Krey|2012|pp=280–281}}</ref> This led to a people and culture descended from remaining European inhabitants of the crusader states, particularly French Levantines in [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and [[Turkey]].

These people, known as Levantines or Franco-Levantines (''Frankolevantini''; French Levantins, [[Italian language|Italian]] Levantini, [[Greek Language|Greek]] Φραγκολεβαντίνοι, and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] Levantenler or Tatlısu [[Franks#Legacy|Frenk]]leri), are [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]]. They are now concentrated in the Istanbul districts of [[Galata]], [[Beyoğlu]] and [[Nişantaşı]], the [[İzmir]] districts of [[Karşıyaka]], [[Bornova]] and [[Buca]], and in [[Mersin]] (where they were influential in creating and reviving an [[opera]]tic tradition.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The term "Levantine" was used pejoratively for inhabitants of mixed [[Arab]] and European descent and for Europeans (usually French, Italian or Greek) who adopted local dress and customs.<ref>{{OED| Levantine }}</ref>

The Crusades influenced the attitude of the Western Church towards warfare, with the frequent calling of crusades habituating the clergy to violence. They also sparked a debate about the legitimacy of seizing land and possessions from pagans on purely religious grounds which would resurface during the [[Age of Discovery]] in the 15th and 16th centuries.<ref>{{Harvnb| Housley |2006|pp=146–147}}</ref> The needs of crusading stimulated secular governmental developments, not all of which were positive; resources used in crusading could have been used by developing states for local and regional needs.<ref>{{Harvnb| Housley |2006|p=149}}</ref>

Its power and prestige raised by the Crusades, the papal [[curia]] had greater control of the western Church and extended the system of papal taxation through the ecclesiastical structure of the West. The system of indulgences grew significantly in late medieval Europe, sparking the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the early 16th century.<ref>{{Harvnb| Housley |2006|pp=147–149}}</ref>

Helen Nicholson argues that the Christians of Western Europe considered the Muslims to be a terrible threat, but by increasing contact the Crusades actually improved their perception of Islamic culture.<ref>{{Harvnb | Nicholson |2004 |p=96}}</ref> The Crusades, alongside contact in Sicily and Spain, led to knowledge exchange. The Christians learnt new ideas from the Muslims in literature and hygiene. The Muslims also had classic Greek and Romans texts in their libraries allowing Europe to rediscover pre-Christian philosophy.<ref>{{Harvnb | Nicholson |2004 |pp=93–94}}</ref> In contrast the Muslim world took little from the Crusaders beyond military tactics and did not take any real interest in European culture until the 16th-century. Indeed, the Crusades were of little interest to the Muslim world: there was no history of the crusades translated into Arabic until 1865 and no published work by a Muslim until 1899.<ref>{{Harvnb | Nicholson |2004 |p=95}}</ref>

Although the Albigensian Crusade intended to eliminate [[Catharism]] in [[Languedoc]], France acquired lands with closer cultural and linguistic ties to [[Principality of Catalonia|Catalonia]]. The crusade also had a role in the creation and institutionalization of the [[Dominican Order]] and the [[Medieval Inquisition]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Strayer|1992|p=143}}</ref> The [[persecution of Jews in the First Crusade]] is part of the long history of anti-Semitism in Europe.<ref>{{Harvnb| Housley |2006|pp=161–163}}</ref>
The need to raise, transport and supply large armies led to flourishing [[Trade route|trade]] between Europe and the ''outremer''. Genoa and Venice flourished, with profitable trading colonies in crusader states in the [[Holy Land]] and (later) in captured [[Byzantine]] territory.<ref>{{Harvnb| Housley |2006|pp=152–154}}</ref>
