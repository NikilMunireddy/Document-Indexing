'''Heterobranchia''', the ''heterobranchs'' (meaning "different-gilled snails"), is a [[taxonomic]] [[clade]] of [[snail]]s and [[slugs]], which includes [[marine (ocean)|marine]], [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusc|mollusk]]s.

Heterobranchia is one of the main clades of gastropods. Currently Heterobranchia comprises three informal groups: the [[Lower Heterobranchia]], the [[Opisthobranchia]] and the [[Pulmonata]], also known as the lower heterobranchs, the opisthobranchs and the pulmonates.<ref name="Bouchet">Bouchet P. & Rocroi J.-P.

==Diversity ==
The three subdivisions of this large clade are quite diverse:

* The [[Lower Heterobranchia]] includes shelled marine and freshwater species.
* [[Opisthobranchia]] are almost all marine species, some [[gastropod shell|shelled]] and some not. The internal organs of the opisthobranchs have undergone detorsion (unwinding of the viscera that were twisted during [[torsion (gastropod)|torsion]]).
* The [[Pulmonata]] includes the majority of land snails and slugs, many freshwater snails, and a small number of marine species. The mantle cavity of the Pulmonata is modified into an air-breathing organ. They are also characterized by detorsion and a symmetrically-arranged nervous system. The pulmonates almost always lack an [[Operculum (gastropod)|operculum]] and are [[hermaphroditic]].

==Taxonomy ==

=== Older taxonomy ===
The families currently included in Heterobranchia have historically been placed in many different parts of the taxonomic class of gastropods. Earlier authors (such as [[John Edward Gray|J.E. Gray]], 1840) considered Heterobranchia to consist of only marine gastropods, and conceptualized it as a borderline category, intermediate between the [[Opisthobranchia]] & [[Pulmonata]], and all the other gastropods.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Haszprunar G. |title = The Heterobranchia ― a new concept of the phylogeny of the higher Gastropoda|year = 1985| journal = Zeitschrift für zoologische Systematik und Evolutionsforschung|volume = 23| issue = 1 | pages = 15–37}}  {{ISSN|0044-3808}}</ref>

The (sometimes recognized) category [[Heterostropha]] within the Heterobranchia, which includes such families as [[Architectonicidae]], the sundial or staircase snails, is primarily characterized by a shell which has a heterostrophic [[protoconch]], in other words the apical whorls are coiled in the opposite plane to the adult whorls. The classification of this group was revised by [[Winston Ponder|Ponder]] & Warén in 1988.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Ponder, W. F.  |author2=Warén, A. |title = Classification of the Caenogastropoda and Heterostropha- A list of family-group names and higher taxa|year = 1988| journal = Malacological review supplement |volume = 4| issue =| pages = 288–317}}</ref>

According to the  older [[taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder & Lindberg, 1997)]] the Heterobranchia were ranked as a superorder.

=== 2005 taxonomy ===
[[File:Heterobranchia tree.png|thumb|The graph of [[neighbor-joining]] [[phylogenetic tree]] shows that there is no clade-supporting pattern for the monophyly of Opisthobranchia (green) or of Pulmonata (yellow) based on datasets by Jörger et al. (2010).<ref name="Jörger 2010"/>]]
Heterobranchia is currently one of the main clades of gastropods. For a detailed taxonomy, see [[Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005)#Clade Heterobranchia]].

=== 2010 taxonomy ===
Jörger et al. (2010)<ref name="Jörger 2010"/> have redefined major groups within the Heterobranchia: they created the new clades [[Euopisthobranchia]] and [[Panpulmonata]].<ref name="Jörger 2010">{{cite journal |author1=Jörger K.
