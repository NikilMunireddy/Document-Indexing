'''ART Grand Prix''' is a French motor racing team that competes in [[Formula racing|formula]] [[Open wheel car|single-seaters]] in [[Europe]]. In 2012, it competed in the [[GP2 Series]] and [[GP3 Series]] as '''Lotus GP''' to reflect sponsorship from British sports and racing car manufacturer [[Lotus Cars|Lotus]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Lotus ART change name to Lotus GP|url=http://gp2fanatic.wordpress.com/2012/01/10/lotus-art-change-name-to-lotus-gp/|first=Filiberto|last=Geoni|work=GP2 Fanatic|publisher=Filiberto Geoni|date=10 January 2012|accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref> The team competed as '''Lotus ART''' in 2011.

Notable ART drivers include [[Olivier Pla]], [[Jamie Green]], [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Sebastian Vettel]], [[Adrian Sutil]], [[Paul di Resta]], [[Romain Grosjean]], [[Lucas di Grassi]], [[Nico Hülkenberg]], [[Jules Bianchi]], [[Valtteri Bottas]], [[Esteban Gutiérrez]] and [[Nico Rosberg]].

==Creation==
ART Grand Prix was created in 2005 as a collaborative project between Frédéric Vasseur, the principal of '''ASM Formule 3''', and [[Nicolas Todt]], the son of the then [[Scuderia Ferrari]] team principal and now [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA) President [[Jean Todt]]. Vasseur wanted to expand his championship-winning [[Formula Three]] team into the newly created [[GP2 Series]] that supports Grands Prix in Europe, while Nicolas Todt had expressed an interest in team management. He had become involved in motorsport as a driver manager, and was notable for representing [[Felipe Massa]]. Todt took charge of the new team's commercial and promotional interests, while Vasseur managed the day-to-day running of the operation. ART is based at the ASM workshops at Villeneuve-la-Guyard in the département of [[Yonne]], [[France]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Racing history==

===Formula Renault and Formula Three===
ASM had already competed in [[Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0|European]] and [[Formula Renault 2.0 West European Cup|French]] Formula Renault 2.0 before expanding its operations to include the [[Formula 3 Euroseries]] in [[2003 Formula 3 Euro Series season|2003]]. In [[2004 Formula 3 Euro Series season|2004]], the team dominated, with drivers [[Jamie Green]] and [[Alexandre Prémat]] finishing first and second in the drivers' championship - the latter also winning the 2004 [[Macau Grand Prix]]. The trend continued after ART was formed: the team won five straight teams' titles from the award's inauguration in [[2005 Formula 3 Euro Series season|2005]] to [[2009 Formula 3 Euro Series season|2009]], and won the drivers' championships in these years with [[Lewis Hamilton]], [[Paul di Resta]], [[Romain Grosjean]], [[Nico Hülkenberg]] and [[Jules Bianchi]] respectively. Future [[Formula One]] drivers [[Adrian Sutil]], [[Sebastian Vettel]] and [[Kamui Kobayashi]] also achieved success with the team. In [[2010 Formula 3 Euro Series season|2010]], ART's stranglehold on the championship was broken by French rivals [[Signature Team|Signature]], who fielded [[Edoardo Mortara]] to victory in a [[Volkswagen]]-powered car, ahead of ART's lead driver [[Valtteri Bottas]], who was the lead [[Mercedes-Benz in motorsport|Mercedes]]-powered driver. At the end of the season, ART withdrew from the F3 Euroseries to concentrate on the [[GP2 Series|GP]] and [[GP3 Series]].

===GP2 Series===

ART Grand Prix was one of several teams to enter the new [[GP2 Series]] in [[2005 GP2 Series season|2005]]. In the team's debut season, it employed [[Formula 3 Euro Series|F3 Euroseries]] graduates [[Alexandre Prémat]], of France, and [[Nico Rosberg]], of Germany. Against drivers who had prior experience at this level, from [[International Formula 3000|Formula 3000]], Rosberg became the inaugural GP2 Drivers' Champion. He showed consistency, with points scoring results at every race meeting, and his championship challenge became stronger as the year progressed. Prémat was 4th in the championship, which was enough to provide ART with the Teams' Championship title. Rosberg's increasingly rapid rise to the top continued when he graduated to [[Formula One]] with [[WilliamsF1|Williams]].

Prémat remained with ART in 2006,<ref>[http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/48850 Premat renews with ART], ''autosport.com'' (5 January 2006).</ref> and was joined by Britain's [[Lewis Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/49134 Hamilton confirmed at ART], ''autosport.com'' (19 January 2006).</ref> He was a logical choice, having dominated the [[Formula 3 Euro Series|F3 Euroseries]] with ASM Formule 3, ART's sister team. Hamilton took an impressive title in his debut season, though his performances faltered slightly mid-season against an increased challenge from the eventual runner-up, [[Nelson Piquet, Jr.]]. Prémat was a consistent and reliable number two to Hamilton; his third position in the Drivers' Championship contributed to ART's second consecutive Teams' title.

For the [[2007 GP2 Series season|2007 season]], ART signed [[Michael Ammermüller]] and [[Lucas di Grassi]]. Ammermüller's campaign was hampered by injury, and he was later dropped in favour of [[Sébastien Buemi]], with [[Mikhail Aleshin]] also deputising. Di Grassi emerged as the team's leader, his consistent finishing record allowing him to finish as runner-up in the drivers' championship to [[Timo Glock]] despite winning only a single race. The points he accumulated also allowed ART to salvage second in the teams' championship, in spite of the fact that the drivers of the team's other car scored a mere ten points between them.

ART's driver line-up changed again for [[2008 GP2 Series season|2008]], with the experienced [[Luca Filippi]] partnered by series rookie [[Romain Grosjean]]. Grosjean quickly established himself as the number one, winning two races and taking several additional podium finishes en route to fourth in the drivers' championship, only 14 points behind champion [[Giorgio Pantano]]. By contrast, Filippi was dropped after scoring points just twice in the first half of the year; he was replaced by [[Sakon Yamamoto]], who also failed to trouble the leading runners despite his [[Formula One]] experience. The team slipped to fifth in the championship.

The [[2009 GP2 Series season|2009 season]] saw another complete overhaul of the team's driving strength, with [[Pastor Maldonado]] joining from [[Minardi Piquet Sports]] and [[Nico Hülkenberg]] graduating to the series as the reigning [[Formula 3 Euroseries]] champion. The season soon developed into a contest between Hülkenberg and the two [[Addax Team|Addax]] drivers, Grosjean and [[Vitaly Petrov]]. Grosjean left the series mid-season after being called up by the [[Renault F1|Renault]] F1 team, and Hülkenberg prevailed over Petrov with a total of five victories and 100 points. Maldonado started the year brightly with two sprint-race wins in the first half of the season, but his form tailed off later on, restricting him to sixth in the championship. Nevertheless, ART's tally of points was enough for the outfit to win its third teams' championship in five years.

Another clear-out for the [[2010 GP2 Series season|2010 season]] resulted in the team signing [[Jules Bianchi]] and [[Sam Bird]], two rookies from the F3 Euroseries, which Bianchi had won the previous season with ART. The two were closely matched and featured at or near the front of the field for much of the season, but their inexperience precluded them from challenging for the championship as the GP2 Series became more established with a growing number of experienced drivers. They finished third (Bianchi) and fifth (Bird) in the drivers' championship, with ART finishing in third place in the teams' championship.

For the [[2011 GP2 Series season|2011 season]], ART reached an agreement with [[Lotus Cars]] to run under the Lotus ART moniker. The team switched from its traditional white-and-red livery to a [[Team Lotus]]-inspired green-and-yellow scheme, although this was somewhat confusing as Lotus Cars (sponsoring the [[Renault F1|Renault]] team) was involved in a legal dispute in [[Formula One]] with [[Team Lotus (2010-11)|a new incarnation of Team Lotus]] (now [[Caterham F1 Team|Caterham]]) over the use of the name. Team Lotus was also competing with a green-and-yellow livery, whereas Renault (competing as Lotus Renault GP) was running a black-and-gold colour scheme reminiscent of the original Team Lotus's association with [[John Player & Sons|John Player Specials]]. As for the drivers, Bianchi was retained alongside Esteban Gutiérrez, who was promoted to GP2 after winning the inaugural [[GP3 Series]] championship with ART. Bianchi retained his third place in the championship but his season was slightly disappointing as he failed to mount a championship challenge despite his greater experience and his status as a pre-season favourite, whilst Gutiérrez played himself in with a single victory on his way to 13th place in the championship. ART again slipped to fifth in the teams' championship.

The deal with Lotus was extended for the [[2012 GP2 Series season|2012 season]], with the team name adjusted to Lotus GP and the colour scheme now altered to match the black-and-gold livery used by the [[Lotus F1]] team, the Renault name having been dropped and the dispute with Caterham solved. With Bianchi moving to the [[Formula Renault 3.5 Series]], another ART GP3 graduate, [[James Calado]], was signed to partner Gutiérrez. The second-year driver improved to third place in the drivers' championship with three victories, albeit someway behind title protagonists [[Davide Valsecchi]] and [[Luiz Razia]], whilst Calado impressed by winning twice and finishing fifth overall as the season's top rookie driver. In 2014, the team finished 3rd in the constructor's championship whilst rookie [[Stoffel Vandoorne]] finished as GP2 runner-up.

The team entered the [[2015 GP2 Series season|2015 season]] with Vandoorne and [[Nobuharu Matsushita]] as their drivers. The team scored eight victories, with Vandoorne claiming the driver's title at [[Sochi Autodrom|Sochi]], and claimed its first Team Championship since [[2009 GP2 Series season|2009]].

The team will go into the [[2016 GP2 Series|2016 season]] with Matsushita and [[Sergey Sirotkin (racing driver)|Sergey Sirotkin]] racing with them.

===GP3 Series===
ART signed up for the first season of the new [[GP3 Series]], the feeder category of GP2, in [[2010 GP3 Series season|2010]].  The team immediately replicated its success in other series, with [[Esteban Gutiérrez]] becoming the inaugural champion. Team-mates [[Alexander Rossi (racing driver)|Alexander Rossi]] and [[Pedro Nunes (racing driver)|Pedro Nunes]] finished fourth and 24th respectively, and ART won the teams' championship. The [[2011 GP3 Series season|2011 season]] saw ART's success continue, with the championship distilling into a battle between its two leading drivers, ART F3 Euroseries graduate [[Valtteri Bottas]] and [[James Calado]], with the former winning by seven points. The remaining seat was initially taken by Nunes, but he was dropped after a disappointing run and replaced by [[Richie Stanaway]], who also scored points and helped ART to its second straight teams' championship. All three of ART's [[2012 GP3 Series season|2012]] drivers were competitive, securing a third straight teams' championship, but neither won the drivers' title: [[Daniel Abt]]'s late-season charge brought him up just short of victor [[Mitch Evans]], whilst his early-season rival [[Aaro Vainio]] fell away to take fourth, and [[Conor Daly]] was also a consistent frontrunner in sixth place overall.

[[2014 GP3 Series season|2014]] saw ART race with [[Alex Fontana]], [[Dino Zamparelli]] and GP3 debutant [[Marvin Kirchhöfer]]. By losing the titles to [[Alex Lynn]] and [[Carlin Motorsport|Carlin]], 2014 also marked the first time ART failed to win the constructor's title.

For [[2015 GP3 Series season|2015]], Kirchhöfer will be retained with [[Alfonso Celis, Jr.]] joining from [[Status Grand Prix]] and [[2014 European Formula 3 season|2014 European Formula 3]] champion [[Esteban Ocon]] making his GP3 debut with the team. The team secured the constructor's title in [[Bahrain International Circuit|Bahrain]], with Ocon securing the championship.

==Formula one entry bid==
ART launched an entry into [[Formula One]] as one of many candidates to fill in the 13th slot for the {{F1|2011}} Formula One season with a possible partnership from the now-defunct [[Toyota Racing]] Grand Prix team. Also the team announced that it was going to phase out its Formula 3 operation because it wanted to focus only on GP3 and GP2. The 2010 Formula 3 season proved to be ART Grand Prix's last.<ref>[http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/88114 ART pulls out of Formula 3]</ref> ART Grand Prix announced their entry bid for F1 on 13 May 2010.<ref>http://www.thef1times.com/news/display/01036</ref>

On 24 June 2010, [[Autosport]] magazine said that ART were set to become the 13th team for {{F1|2011}}. However, on 7 July 2010, ART announced in its official statement withdrawal of its entry bid. ART declared in its official statement that "ART Grand Prix had forged strong bonds with several technical and financial partners but with unfavourable economic conditions they could not gather the necessary guarantees to ensure the stability of the project in the long term." As revealed by one of the Formula One insiders during the [[TV Nova (Czech Republic)|Czech TV NOVA]] live coverage of the [[2010 British Grand Prix]], one of the crucial partners was [[Michelin]], who did not succeed in their efforts to become an official Formula One tyre supplier from 2011.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
