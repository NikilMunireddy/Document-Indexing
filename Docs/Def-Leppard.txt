'''Def Leppard''' are<!-- group is plural hence are --> an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1977 in [[Sheffield]] as part of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement. Since 1992, the band has consisted of [[Joe Elliott]] (lead vocals), [[Rick Savage]] (bassist, backing vocals), [[Rick Allen (drummer)|Rick Allen]] (drums, backing vocals), [[Phil Collen]] (guitar, backing vocals), and [[Vivian Campbell]] (guitar, backing vocals). This is the band's longest-standing line-up.

The band's strongest commercial success came between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Their 1981 [[studio album|album]], ''[[High 'n' Dry]]'', was produced by [[Robert Lange|Robert John "Mutt" Lange]], who helped them begin to define their style, and the album's standout track "[[Bringin' On the Heartbreak]]" became one of the first rock videos played on [[MTV]] in 1982. The band's next studio album, ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' in January 1983, with "[[Photograph (Def Leppard song)|Photograph]]" as the lead single, turned Def Leppard into a household name. In the U.S., ''Pyromania'' was certified Diamond (10× Platinum). In 2003, the album ranked number 384 on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].<ref name="RSPyromania"/>

Def Leppard's fourth album ''[[Hysteria (Def Leppard album)|Hysteria]]'', released in August 1987, topped the UK and U.S. album charts. As of 2009, it has reached beyond the success of ''Pyromania,'' having been certified 12× [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] for sales of over 12 million in the U.S. and has gone on to sell over 25 million copies worldwide.<ref name=erg>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/music/news/article.cfm?c_id=264&objectid=10539947&pnum=0 |title=One giant Leppard |author=Kara, Scott |date=30 October 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> The album spawned seven hit singles, including the [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one "[[Love Bites (Def Leppard song)|Love Bites]]", alongside "[[Pour Some Sugar on Me]]", "[[Hysteria (Def Leppard song)|Hysteria]]", "[[Armageddon It]]", "[[Animal (Def Leppard song)|Animal]]", "[[Rocket (Def Leppard song)|Rocket]]", and "[[Women (Def Leppard song)|Women]]". Their next studio album, ''[[Adrenalize]]'' (the first following the death of guitarist [[Steve Clark]]), reached number one in the UK and U.S. charts in 1992, and contained several hits, including "[[Let's Get Rocked]]" and "[[Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad]]". Their 1993 album, ''[[Retro Active]]'', contained the [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] hit song "[[Two Steps Behind]]", while their greatest-hits album ''[[Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits (1980–1995)|Vault]]'', released in 1995, featured the UK hit "[[When Love & Hate Collide]]".

== History ==

=== Early years (1977–1979) ===
[[Rick Savage]], [[Tony Kenning]], and [[Pete Willis]], all students at [[Tapton School]] in [[Sheffield]], [[South Yorkshire]], formed a band called [[Atomic Mass (band)|Atomic Mass]] in 1977. The band originally consisted of Willis on guitar, Savage on bass (after originally playing guitar), and Kenning on drums. Only 18 at the time, [[Joe Elliott]] tried out for the band as a guitarist following a chance meeting with Willis after missing a bus, in November 1977. During his audition it was decided that he was better suited to be the lead singer. Their first ever gig was in the dining hall in A Block in Westfield School in Mosborough, Sheffield.<ref>Pete Frame (1999). ''Pete Frame's Rockin' Around Britain: Rock'n'roll Landmarks of the UK and Ireland''. p. 211. Music Sales Group</ref>

[[File:JoeElliott.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Lead singer [[Joe Elliott]]]]
The band adopted a name proposed by Elliott, "Deaf Leopard", which was originally a band name he thought up while writing reviews for imaginary rock bands in his English class (and in at least partial reference to [[Led Zeppelin]]).<ref>According to the book ''Bang Your Head: The Rise And Fall of Heavy Metal'' by David Konow.</ref> At Kenning's suggestion, the spelling was slightly modified in order to make the name seem less like that of a punk band. In January 1978, [[Steve Clark]] joined the band.  According to Elliott, he successfully auditioned for the band by playing Lynyrd Skynyrd's "[[Free Bird]]" in its entirety.<ref>Prato, Greg. [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-clark-p64813/biography Steve Clark Biography] Allmusic. Retrieved 17 November 2011</ref>

In November, just prior to recording sessions for what would be a three-song release known as ''[[The Def Leppard E.P.]]'', Kenning abruptly left the band; he would later form the band Cairo. He was replaced for those sessions by [[Frank Noon]]. By the end of the month, [[Rick Allen (drummer)|Rick Allen]], then only 15 years old, had joined the band as its full-time drummer. Sales of the EP soared after the track "Getcha Rocks Off" was given extensive airtime by renowned [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[John Peel]], considered at the time to be a champion of [[punk rock]] and [[new wave music]].<ref>Bronson, Fred (1997). ''The Billboard book of number one hits''. Billboard Books, 1 December 1997</ref>

Throughout 1979, the band developed a loyal following among British [[hard rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] fans and were considered among the leaders of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement. Their growing popularity led to a record deal with the major label Phonogram/Vertigo (Mercury Records in the US). Def Leppard's original management, MSB, a local duo consisting of Pete Martin and Frank Stuart-Brown, were fired after Martin and Joe Elliott got into a fistfight over an incident on the road. The band approached [[Peter Mensch]] of Leber-Krebs management, who had booked them on a tour of the UK supporting AC/DC. Mensch, who admitted that he had had his eye on the band, became their manager.<ref name="veoh.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.veoh.com/watch/v7578164ZNSqXrnq?h1=Rock+Of+Ages+-+The+Def+Leppard+Story |title=Watch Videos Online &#124; Rock Of Ages - The Def Leppard Story |publisher=Veoh.com |date=2 May 2008 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>

=== Rise to fame (1980–1983) ===
Def Leppard's debut album, ''[[On Through the Night]]'', was released on 14 March 1980. Although the album hit the Top 15 in the UK, many early fans were turned off by the perception that the band was trying too hard to appeal to American audiences by recording songs such as "Hello America" and touring more in the US (supporting [[Pat Travers]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Ted Nugent]]). A performance at the [[Reading Festival]] in August was marred when audience members expressed their displeasure by pelting the band with beer cans and bottles filled with urine. This incident was partially blamed on a cover story in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' music newspaper by the journalist Geoff Barton entitled "Has the Leppard changed its spots?" accusing the band of selling out to the American market. In a documentary on the band recorded for BBC 2, Barton recalls feelings of guilt over the story and having a "stand-up row" with the band's manager, Mensch, backstage at the show.<ref name="veoh.com"/><ref>Peter Buckley (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&pg=PT287 The rough guide to rock]</ref><ref>Colin Larkin (1995) ''The Guinness encyclopedia of popular music'', Volumes 1–6. p.1118.</ref> In the documentary series [[Metal Evolution]], Joe Elliott says that the media had exaggerated the event and all bands on the day had experienced the 'abuse' from the crowd.<ref>Metal Evolution, Season 1 Director [[Sam Dunn]]</ref>
[[File:Collen2.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Co-lead guitarist [[Phil Collen]]]]
The band had by then caught the attention of AC/DC producer [[Robert Lange|Robert John "Mutt" Lange]], who agreed to work on their second album, ''[[High 'n' Dry]]'', released on 11 July 1981. Lange's meticulous approach in the studio helped them begin to define their sound.  Despite the album's unimpressive sales figures, the band's video for "[[Bringin' On the Heartbreak]]" became one of the first metal videos played on MTV in 1982, bringing the band increased visibility in the U.S.<ref>Daniel Bukszpan, Ronnie James Dio (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=YaDDsg0H35gC&pg=PT47&dq=bringin+on+the+heartbreak+MTV&hl=en&ei=K8N6TNWRI5KROOr4gIwC&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=bringin%20on%20the%20heartbreak%20MTV&f=false The Encyclopedia of Heavy Metal]</ref> The band continued to use the up-and-coming music television industry to reach fans over the years with their unique videos and the extravagance of their concerts.<ref>Robert Walser. "Def Leppard." ''Grove Music Online''. ''Oxford Music Online''. Oxford University Press. Web. 14 February 2016.</ref>  After the album's release, a European tour followed.  The band opened for [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]].<ref>[http://defleppard.com/band/index.html Band Biography], DefLeppard.com. {{wayback|url=http://defleppard.com/band/index.html |date=20060223063516 |df=y }}</ref>

[[Phil Collen]], former guitarist with the glam band [[Girl (band)|Girl]], on 12 July 1982 replaced Pete Willis, who had been fired the previous day because of excessive alcohol consumption on the job. (Willis would later resurface with the bands [[Gogmagog (band)|Gogmagog]] and [[Roadhouse (band)|Roadhouse]].) This personnel change took place during the recording of their third album, ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'', which was released on 20 January 1983 and also produced by Lange. The cover artwork depicted an animated picture of a huge flame emerging from the top floor of a skyscraper, with a [[bullseye (target)|bullseye]] aimed at the flame. Though many stores would not carry the album due to the cover, the band did not change the artwork. The lead single, "[[Photograph (Def Leppard song)|Photograph]]", turned Def Leppard into a household name, supplanting [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Beat It]]" as the most requested video clip on MTV and becoming a staple of rock radio (dominating the US Album Rock Charts for six weeks), and sparked a headline tour across the U.S.<ref>Bob Batchelor, Scott Stoddart [https://books.google.com/books?id=uIqyMMogRsMC&pg=PA121&dq=rick+allen+-+def+leppard&hl=en&ei=j796TOK4JMzgOKaylfwF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=rick%20allen%20-%20def%20leppard&f=false The 1980s] Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007</ref>

Fueled by "Photograph" and subsequent singles "[[Rock of Ages (Def Leppard song)|Rock of Ages]]" and "[[Foolin']]", ''Pyromania'' went on to sell six million copies in 1983 (more than 100,000 copies every week in that year) and was held off the top of the US album charts only by Michael Jackson's ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]].'' With the album's massive success, ''Pyromania'' was the catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement.<ref name="Pyromania">[http://www.allmusic.com/album/pyromania-r5349 Pyromania: Def Leppard] Allmusic. Retrieved 17 November 2011</ref> In 2004, ''Pyromania'' was [[RIAA certification|certified Diamond]] having sold over 10 million copies in the US.<ref>[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblDiamond Diamond Awards] ''[[RIAA]]'' Retrieved 28 January 2011</ref> Def Leppard's US tour in support of ''Pyromania'' began opening for [[Billy Squier]] in March and ended with a headlining performance before an audience of 55,000 at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego, California in September. As a testament to the band's popularity at the time, a US Gallup poll in 1984 saw Def Leppard voted as favourite rock band over peers such as [[The Rolling Stones]], AC/DC, and [[Journey (band)|Journey]]. However, in their native England, [[Duran Duran]] secured the number one spot.

=== ''Hysteria'' era (1984–1989) ===

Following their breakthrough, the band moved to [[Dublin]] in February 1984 for tax purposes to begin writing the follow-up to ''Pyromania''. Mutt Lange initially joined in on the songwriting sessions but then suddenly declined to return as producer due to exhaustion. Instead, [[Jim Steinman]] (of [[Meat Loaf]]'s ''[[Bat Out of Hell]]'' fame) was brought in.

On 31 December 1984, drummer Rick Allen lost his left arm in a car crash on the [[A57 road|A57]] in the hills outside the band's home city of Sheffield. Allen was driving with his Dutch girl-friend, Miriam Barendsen, when his [[Chevrolet Corvette|Corvette]] swerved off the road on a sharp bend and went through a drystone wall. Despite the severity of the accident, Allen was committed to continuing his role as Def Leppard's drummer, and realised that he could use his legs to do some of the drumming work previously done with his arms.<ref name="RSHysteria"/> He then worked with [[Simmons (electronic drum company)|Simmons]] to design a custom [[Electronic drum|electronic drum kit]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=60Jde3l7WNwC&pg=PA188&dq=rick+allen+def+leppard&hl=en&ei=cq57TP3dFNy4jAeXt8XABg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=rick%20allen%20def%20leppard&f=false Legends of rock guitar: the essential reference of rock's greatest guitarists] Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997</ref> The other members of the band supported Allen's recovery and never sought a replacement. Allen was placed in a separate studio to practice his new drums. After a few months, Allen gathered the band together and performed the intro to the Led Zeppelin version of "[[When the Levee Breaks#Led Zeppelin version|When the Levee Breaks]]" to showcase his progress to the band. Joe Elliott reports this as being a "very emotional moment."  During this period, Mutt Lange returned as producer. Def Leppard brought in [[Jeff Rich]] in August 1986 to play alongside Allen during Def Leppard's warm-up mini tour of Ireland, but after Rich accidentally missed a gig, he and the band realised Allen could drum alone. Allen's comeback was sealed at the 1986 [[Monsters of Rock]] festival in England, with an emotionally charged ovation after his introduction by Joe Elliott.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=def leppard|bio=true}} Def Leppard Biography].

After over three years of recording, Def Leppard's fourth album, ''[[Hysteria (Def Leppard album)|Hysteria]]'', was released on 3 August 1987. The first single from the album, "[[Animal (Def Leppard song)|Animal]]", became the band's first Top 10 hit in the UK, reaching No.&nbsp;6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=CHT>Neil Warwick, Jon Kutner, Tony Brown (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=ib4MyAIpe3MC&pg=PT268&lpg=PT268&dq=when+love+and+hate+collide+%232+UK+Chart&source=bl&ots=lnuwAN-YNO&sig=Q7VmF99qBXDvSTdFPbqvXVHNXT8&hl=en&ei=TXeFTMLHAY-d4QbtrtTSBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCMQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=when%20love%20and%20hate%20collide%20%232%20UK%20Chart&f=false The complete book of the British charts: singles & albums] Omnibus Press, 2004</ref> "Animal" also started their run of [[Def Leppard discography#Singles|ten consecutive]] [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. ''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Top 40 singles.<ref name="BillboardSinglesChart">[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=def leppard|chart=all}} Def Leppard: Song Chart History] Billboard.

The band's UK success saw them nominated for the [[List of Brit Awards ceremonies#1988|1988 Brit Award]] for Best British Group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awardsandwinners.com/category/brit-awards/1988/ |work=Awards & Winners |title=1988 Brit Awards |accessdate=5 August 2015}}</ref> In October 1988, the power ballad "[[Love Bites (Def Leppard song)|Love Bites]]" reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="BillboardSinglesChart"/> In January 1989, the band scored another US Top&nbsp;5 hit with "[[Armageddon It]]", and by spring of 1989 the final single "[[Rocket (Def Leppard song)|Rocket]]" was in the Top 20.<ref name="BillboardSinglesChart"/> Wanting to give fans something new after the massive radio and video airplay for not only the 7 singles but also the Album tracks that Radio DJs were playing off the album, the band performed "Tear It Down", a Hysteria [[B-side]] at the [[1989 MTV Video Music Awards]].

=== ''Adrenalize'', Clark's death, and change in musical direction (1990–1999) ===
[[File:Steve Clark.jpeg|thumb|right|190px|Former co-lead guitarist [[Steve Clark]] died in London in 1991]]
Following ''Hysteria'', the band quickly set out to work on their fifth album, hoping to avoid another lengthy gap. [[Steve Clark]]'s alcoholism worsened to the point that he was constantly in and out of [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. Recording sessions suffered from this distraction, and in mid-1990, Clark was granted a six-month leave of absence from the band. Clark died from a mix of prescription drugs and alcohol on 8 January 1991, in his London home.<ref>Stanton, Scott [https://books.google.com/books?id=53iA5w5sR8wC&pg=PA303&dq=steve+clark+def+leppard&hl=en&ei=Fv6ATKOTCMqMOITA2KoO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=steve%20clark%20def%20leppard&f=false The tombstone tourist: musicians]</ref>

The remaining band members decided to carry on and recorded the album as a four-piece, with Collen mimicking Clark's style on his intended guitar parts.  Def Leppard's fifth album, ''[[Adrenalize]]'', was finally released on 31 March 1992.

[[File:CampbellDef.JPG|thumb|left|190px|[[Vivian Campbell]] replaced Steve Clark in 1992]]
In a period between late 1991 and early 1992, auditions to replace Clark commenced. Among the guitarists who auditioned included [[Adrian Smith]], [[John Sykes]], and [[Gary Hoey]]. Ultimately, the band chose [[Vivian Campbell]] in February 1992, formerly of [[Dio (band)|Dio]] and [[Whitesnake]]. Another world tour followed but the band's fortunes began to be affected by the rise of [[alternative rock]], including [[grunge]].

A collection of b-sides and unreleased tracks recorded between 1984 and 1993, called ''[[Retro Active]]'', was released in October 1993, preceded by the success of "[[Two Steps Behind]]" (from the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] film [[Last Action Hero]]). Another single, "[[Miss You in a Heartbeat]]", hit the Top&nbsp;5 in Canada, becoming one of their biggest hits there. Retro Active has sold 3&nbsp;million copies worldwide to date. Two years later, Def Leppard issued their first greatest hits collection, ''[[Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits (1980–1995)]]'', which reached number 3 in the UK, and sold over 5&nbsp;million copies in the US.<ref name=CHT/><ref>[http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/week-ending-june-12-2011-albums-the-tortoise-amp-the-hare.html Week Ending 12 June 2011.

The compilation included a new track, the power ballad "[[When Love & Hate Collide]]", which became their biggest ever hit in the UK, hitting No.&nbsp;2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com/searchsec.php |title=UK Top 40 Hit Database |publisher=everyHit.com |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

On 23 October 1995, the band entered the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' by performing three concerts on three continents in one day (Tangiers, Morocco; London, England; and Vancouver, Canada).<ref>''[[The Guinness Book of Records]], 1997'' p.272</ref>

''[[Slang (album)|Slang]]'', released in May 1996, marked a drastic musical departure for the band by featuring darker lyrics and a stripped-down alternative rock edge. The band rehearsed and played the songs together in the studio instead of recording parts separately, resulting in a much more live-sounding album.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Newman|first1=Melinda|title=Def Leppard Shifts Gears With "Slang"|journal=Billboard- The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=6 April 1996|issue=108.14|pages=12, 18}}</ref> The US audience reception for ''Slang'' and its [[Def Leppard Slang Tour|subsequent tour]] was a major dropoff from a decade earlier, but ''[[Q Magazine]]'' nonetheless listed ''Slang'' as one of their Top Ten Albums of 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/qlists.html#1996|title=Q lists|publisher=Rocklist.net|accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref> This album was the first recorded performance of Rick Allen playing a semi-acoustic drum kit since his accident, and not his electronic set as was first used with ''[[Hysteria (Def Leppard album)|Hysteria]]''.

[[VH1]] revived the band's fortunes in the US in 1998 by featuring them on one of the first episodes of ''[[Behind the Music]]''. Reruns of the episode yielded some of the series' highest ratings and brought the band's music back into the public consciousness (following years of burial by the alternative rock climate). The episode was even parodied on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. In an effort to capitalise on this new momentum, Def Leppard returned to its classic sound with the 1999 album ''[[Euphoria (Def Leppard album)|Euphoria]]''. The first single, "Promises", reunited the band with Mutt Lange and hit the US Mainstream Rock charts at No.&nbsp;1 for 3 weeks. The album was certified gold in the US and Canada.

=== 2000–2007 ===
On 5 September 2000, Def Leppard were inducted into the Rock Walk of Fame on Hollywood's [[Sunset Boulevard]] by their friend [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. In 2001, VH1 produced and aired ''[[Hysteria - The Def Leppard Story]]'', a biopic that included [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as Mutt Lange and [[Amber Valletta]] as Lorelei Shellist (Steve Clark's girlfriend). The docudrama covered the band's history between 1977 through 1986, recounting the trials and triumphs of Rick Allen and Steve Clark. 18 July broadcast still produced some of the channel's highest-ever ratings and is available on DVD.

Def Leppard's tenth album, ''[[X (Def Leppard album)|X]]'', saw the band's musical direction moving more towards pop and further away from the band's hard rock roots. ''X'' quickly disappeared from the charts, ultimately becoming the band's least successful release. However, the accompanying tour played to the band's strongest audiences since ''Adrenalize''.

[[File:DefLeppard1.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Def Leppard performing in [[Minot, North Dakota]], US, on 26 July 2007]]
An expanded and updated best-of collection, ''Best Of'', was released internationally in October 2004. The North America-only version, ''Rock of Ages – The Definitive Collection'', was released the following May. Def Leppard participated at the [[Live 8]] show in Philadelphia and toured in the summer with [[Bryan Adams]]. In 2005, the band left their longtime management team, Q-Prime, and signed with HK Management.

On 23 May 2006, Def Leppard released an all-covers album titled ''[[Yeah! (Def Leppard album)|Yeah!]]''. The disc pays homage to classic rock songs of their childhood, originally recorded by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[The Kinks]], [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[Electric Light Orchestra|ELO]], and [[Badfinger]] among others. It debuted at No.&nbsp;16 in the US, their tenth consecutive Top&nbsp;20 album.<ref name="BillboardAlbumChart"/>

The band, along with [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and [[Judas Priest]], were the inaugural inductees of "[[VH1 Rock Honors]]" on 31 May 2006. During the show, The [[All-American Rejects]] paid homage to the band with a cover of "Photograph". Soon afterwards, they embarked on a US tour with [[Journey (band)|Journey]]. That October, ''Hysteria'' was re-released in a two-disc deluxe edition format, which combined the original remastered album with b-sides, remixes, and bonus tracks from single releases. Def Leppard began their "[[Downstage Thrust Tour]]", on 27 June, which took them across the US and into Canada. Support bands were [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]].

[[File:Def Leppard Sweden Rock 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Def Leppard at the 2008 [[Sweden Rock Festival]]]]

On 28 April 2008, Def Leppard released their first album of new studio material in six years, ''[[Songs from the Sparkle Lounge]]''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;5 on the ''Billboard'' 200 in the US. The first single was entitled "[[Nine Lives (Def Leppard song)|Nine Lives]]" and featured country singer [[Tim McGraw]], who co-wrote the song with Joe Elliott, Phil Collen, and Rick Savage.

A [[Songs from the Sparkle Lounge Tour|tour]] in support of the album began on 27 March 2008 in Greensboro, North Carolina,<ref>[http://www.defleppard.com/tour/tour_2008.asp Def Leppard.Com] {{wayback|url=http://www.defleppard.com/tour/tour_2008.asp |date=20071218072922 |df=y }}</ref> with Styx and [[REO Speedwagon]] joining the band on US dates. The band also played several European rock festivals. An arena tour of the UK took place in June in which the band co-headlined with Whitesnake and was supported by US southern rockers [[Black Stone Cherry]]. The band then returned to Europe before coming back for a second leg of the UK tour in June. The first of these dates was at the Glasgow SECC on 17 June. Again they were joined by Whitesnake; however, hard rock band [[Thunder (band)|Thunder]] supported at some of these shows. Black Stone Cherry continued to support most of the dates, including some of the Thunder ones. Six shows which were cancelled during the USA/Canada leg of their world tour due to illnesses affecting Joe Elliott and Phil Collen would be rescheduled and played in August of that year. On 11 June, Def Leppard announced further dates for their 2008 World Tour. The extension saw them visit Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Whitesnake continued to support Def Leppard for their Indian and Japanese dates. Def Leppard toured 41 US cities plus Toronto, Canada, during mid-2009 with [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Cheap Trick]] and also played the [[Download Festival]] with [[Whitesnake]] and [[ZZ Top]].

In October 2008, Def Leppard played with country star [[Taylor Swift]] in a taped show in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in a show called [[CMT Crossroads]]: [[Taylor Swift and Def Leppard]]. This was released as a DVD on 16 June 2009 exclusively at Wal-Mart.<ref name=tay>{{cite web|url=http://defleppard.com/news/newsItem.asp?id=180 |title=PRESS RELEASE – CMT CROSSROADS: TAYLOR SWIFT and DEF LEPPARD on DVD 16 June |publisher=Defleppard.com |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> The release was the best-selling DVD of week, and the 10th best selling Wal-Mart music release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://defleppard.com/news/newsItem.asp?id=194 |title=CROSSROADS is Wal-Mart's best-selling DVD this week |publisher=Defleppard.com |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> A fan of the band since childhood, Taylor Swift chose Def Leppard to perform together for the show, and their crossover performance of "Photograph" was up for both Performance of the Year and Wide Open Country Video of the Year at the [[CMT Music Awards]] in 2009.<ref name=tay/> Taylor Swift said of the performance, "Performing with Def Leppard was awesome!

In October 2009 the band announced that they would be cancelling the last leg of the 2009 North American tour, a total of 23 shows. The band cited, "unforeseen personal matters," as the reason for the cancellations.<ref name=cancel/> At the time, the band denied rumours about a breakup, saying, "We're not splitting. Not at all.

=== Recent events and self-titled album (2010–present) ===
After taking a year off from touring in 2010, the band announced on 22 February 2011 that they would be releasing their first live album in the summer. ''[[Mirror Ball – Live & More]]'', a two-disc live album, with three new studio tracks, was released in parts of Europe on 3 June, the rest of Europe on 6 June, and on 7 June in the US; it was announced at the same time that Def Leppard would perform at the [[Download Festival]] on 10 June 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=154360 | title=DEF LEPPARD: Live Album Title Revealed; DOWNLOAD Festival Appearance Announced | accessdate=23 February 2011 | date=22 February 2011 | publisher=Blabbermouth.net | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5whSJKzYk | archivedate=22 February 2011}}</ref> Of the three new studio tracks, two were released as singles, the first single being "[[Undefeated (Def Leppard song)|Undefeated]]" released in April 2011, followed by "It's All About Believin'" released over a year later in May 2012.

The year after, Def Leppard played an eleven show residency at the [[Hard Rock Hotel and Casino (Las Vegas)|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] in Las Vegas, Nevada from 22 March through 13 April 2013. The residency, referred to as Viva! Hysteria, featured a two part show, with the first half featuring Def Leppard opening for themselves, under the alias "Ded Flatbird", (jokingly called the best Def Leppard cover band in the world), when they would then play songs they very rarely play live, going all the way back to "Good Morning Freedom", a b-side from the single "[[Hello America (song)|Hello America]]" released in February 1980, an era usually left untouched by the band. The opening set varied each night, from playing the best hits from albums like ''On Through the Night'', ''Slang'', and ''Euphoria'', to being the entire first half of ''High 'n' Dry''. The second half, and "main event" was Def Leppard, as themselves playing their best-selling album, ''Hysteria'', from start to finish. A live album, also titled ''[[Viva! Hysteria]]'' was released on 22 October 2013. This was the first time the band has played an album live from start to finish.<ref>Mansfield, Brian.

The band has re-recorded several hits and even the entire album ''Hysteria'' in an effort to circumvent their record label from future royalties, though of these re-recordings, only "[[Rock of Ages (Def Leppard song)|Rock Of Ages]]", "[[Pour Some Sugar On Me]]", and "[[Hysteria (Def Leppard song)|Hysteria]]" have actually been released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/News/en-us/Def-Leppard-Release-Re-Recorded-Hysteria.aspx |title=Def Leppard Release Re-Recorded "Hysteria" |publisher=.gibson.com |date=21 March 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/def-leppard-re-recording-hit-songs-to-wrestle-back-career-from-record-label/ |title=Def Leppard Re-Recording Hit Songs to ‘Wrestle Back Career’ From Record Label |publisher=Ultimateclassicrock.com |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/def-leppard-universal-recording-hits-356397 |title=Pour Some Sugar Again: Why Def Leppard is Rerecording Hits |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=8 January 2012 |accessdate=17 April 2014 |first=Shirley |last=Halperin}}</ref>

In June 2013, Vivian Campbell announced that he had developed [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], a malignant form of cancer that affects the Reed-Sternberg cells, located in the lymph nodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqFc3J-5aIs |title=Def Leppard guitarist Vivian Campbell reveals all about life with lymphoma in this rocking film! |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> He continued performing with Def Leppard, and no shows were cancelled or rescheduled. The sole idea of cancelling any shows and not doing anything disgusted Vivian, believing performing would be the best way to remain optimistic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://defleppard.com/news/2013/06/10/message-vivian |title=A Message From Vivian |publisher=Def Leppard |date= |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> In November 2013, he announced he was in [[Cure#Remission|remission]]. However, the cancer has since reemerged, and he is now receiving chemotherapy once again. Should the cancer once again enter remission, he will undergo a stem-cell transplant.

On 11 February 2014, the band released a remastered deluxe edition of their 1996 album ''[[Slang (album)|Slang]]'' after much delay. The album, still coveted by many loyal fans of the band, now features 30 tracks including demos, B-sides, and unreleased material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5901144/def-leppard-slang-remastered-1996-album |title=Def Leppard Revisits Overlooked Album: 'It Went Against the Grain' |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref> From 23 June 2014 to 31 August 2014, Def Leppard and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] toured 42 cities, with a dollar per ticket donated to such military charities as [[Wounded Warrior Project]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://downriversundaytimes.com/2014/03/22/celebrity-extra-243/|title=Celebrity Extra|last=Elavsky|first=Cindy|publisher=[[King Features]]|date=22 March 2014|accessdate= 5 June 2014}}</ref> Def Leppard contributed one song [[Helen Wheels]] to the [[Paul McCartney]] tribute album [[The Art of McCartney]] released on 18 November 2014.

At certain recent points in time, the band had projects, such as a cartoon and a documentary in development. However, these projects seem to be shelved indefinitely. The band had originally planned to do another residency in Las Vegas, this time in honour of ''Pyromania'' (called ''Viva! Pyromania''), but due to the "Heroes 2014" tour with Kiss, and an upcoming, unnamed studio album, the project has been pushed back indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5840318/def-leppard-viva-pyromania-residency-las-vegas-new-studio-album-2014 | title=Def Leppard Plots 'Pyromania' Residency In Las Vegas; New Studio Album In View |publisher=Billboard |date=  |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deflepparduk.com/2014newsjan84.html |title= Vivian Says Pyromania Residency Will Not Happen In 2014 |publisher=deflepparduk |date=  |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> The new album was originally planned to be an EP, but the set-list increased to 15 songs by June 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/phil-collen-delta-deep-def-leppard/ |title=Phil Collen Talks Delta Deep Side Project, Progress on New Def Leppard Album |publisher= Ultimate Classic Rock |date= 16 June 2014 |accessdate= 15 November 2014}}</ref>  The album is planned to be released in 2015 with a tour to follow.<ref>[http://www.virginmedia.com/music/news/story/2014/06/10/def-leppard-plan-new-album-and/ "Def Leppard plan new album and UK tour"].

During the break following their 2015 tour, Def Leppard led the ''Hysteria on the High Seas'' concert cruise aboard the ''[[MSC Divina]]'' in January 2016. Originally supposed to be a cruise just for the concert goers, cabins were later opened up to others due to low sales. Everything aboard the cruise didn't go exactly as planned either when the cruise was not able to dock at the private island due to inclement weather. The problems continued as Joe Elliott became ill with laryngitis on the night of their cruise performance. This led to the band performing without Elliott for the first time in their history. Vivian Campbell and Phil Collen sang lead vocals on two songs of the shortened seven song set in addition to two songs with vocals by [[Andrew Freeman (musician)|Andrew Freeman]] and two more with [[Eric Martin (musician)|Eric Martin]] and [[Kip Winger]].<ref>http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/joe-elliott-forced-to-sit-out-def-leppard-cruise-show-last-in-line-mr-big-winger-singers-step-in/</ref> Further than that, Campbell and Freeman's [[Last in Line]] bandmate [[Jimmy Bain]], former bassist of [[Dio (band)|Dio]] died of lung cancer aboard the ship the same night, causing Last in Line to cancel their show the following day.<ref>http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-rainbowdio-bassist-jimmy-bain-dead-at-68/</ref> Back on land, Elliott struggled through the first concert of the 2016 tour, resulting in [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]]'s [[Jeff Keith]] joining Elliott on lead.

== Musical style and legacy ==
Def Leppard's music is a mixture of hard rock, [[Arena rock|AOR]], pop and heavy metal elements, with its multi-layered, [[Vocal harmony|harmonic vocals]] and its melodic [[guitar riff]]s. However, even though they were often considered one of the top bands of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] movement of the late 1970s, in the mid-1980s the band were associated with the growing [[glam metal]] scene, mainly due to their mainstream success and glossy production. ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' has been cited as the catalyst for the 1980s pop-metal movement.<ref name="Pyromania"/> Def Leppard, however, expressed their dislike of the "glam metal" label, as they thought it did not accurately describe their look or musical style.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://heavymetalmusic.biz/2007/07/06/def-leppard-craves-respect-in-interview/ | title=Def Leppard craves respect in interview | publisher=heavymetalmusic.biz | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309102923/http://heavymetalmusic.biz/2007/07/06/def-leppard-craves-respect-in-interview/ | archivedate=9 March 2009 | date=5 July 2007 | first=Cody | last=McDevitt | accessdate=30 April 2014 }}</ref> By the release of the ''[[Hysteria (Def Leppard album)|Hysteria]]'' album, the band had developed a distinctive sound featuring electronic drums and effects-laden guitar sounds overlaid with a multi-layered wall of husky, harmonised vocals.

Def Leppard was among the most successful of the new wave of British heavy metal bands in the early 1980s. They combined the raw power of metal with a pop emphasis on melody, catchy hooks and vocal harmonies that, particularly later on, contrasted sharply with harsher contemporary metal and punk bands.<ref name="Caulfield"/> Their early albums such as ''On Through the Night'' (1980) appealed to metal fans and influenced the likes of [[Dimebag Darrell]] of [[Pantera]]<ref name="ReferenceA"/> and [[Jeff Hanneman]] of [[Slayer]].<ref name="guitarworld.com"/> Their hugely popular later albums, such as ''Hysteria'' (1987), appeared irregular due to their perfectionism in the studio, but appealed to a broad range of music fans.<ref name="Caulfield">{{cite journal|last1=Caulfield|first1=Keith|title=Viva' Def Leppard!|date=2013|volume=125|issue=43|pages=57|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&sid=b56876b3-cda0-47a8-af44-2f90fc047486%40sessionmgr115&hid=123&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=mah&AN=91811962|accessdate=2 October 2014}}</ref>

Despite their huge commercial success, Elliott has said in an interview that he feels the band does not receive its fair share of respect from the British music press and he claimed the band had been barred from the BBC's ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' series because they were "not [[cool (aesthetic)|cool]] enough".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://metro.co.uk/2010/07/20/joe-elliot-def-leppard-dont-get-enough-respect-453310/ | title= Joe Elliot: Def Leppard don't get enough respect | work=Metro  | date=20 July 2010 | accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>
