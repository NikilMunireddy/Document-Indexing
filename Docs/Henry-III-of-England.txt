'''Henry III''' (1 October 1207&nbsp;– 16 November 1272), also known as '''Henry of Winchester''', was [[King of England]], [[Lordship of Ireland|Lord of Ireland]] and [[Duke of Aquitaine]] from 1216 until his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=262}}</ref> The son of [[John, King of England|King John]] and [[Isabella of Angoulême]], Henry assumed the throne when he was only nine in the middle of the [[First Barons' War]]. Cardinal [[Guala Bicchieri|Guala]] declared the war against the rebel barons to be a religious crusade and Henry's forces, led by [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]], defeated the rebels at the battles of [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|Lincoln]] and [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Sandwich]] in 1217. Henry promised to abide by the [[Magna Carta#The Great Charter 1225|Great Charter of 1225]], which limited royal power and protected the rights of the major barons.<!--Note: the 1225 date is correct in this context, and shouldn't be confused with the 1215 charter--> His early rule was dominated first by [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]] and then [[Peter des Roches]], who re-established royal authority after the war. In 1230 the King attempted to reconquer the [[John, King of England#Loss of Normandy, 1202–04|provinces of France]] that had once belonged to his father, but the invasion was a debacle. A revolt led by William Marshal's son, [[Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Richard]], broke out in 1232, ending in a peace settlement negotiated by [[Christianity in England|the Church]].

Following the revolt, Henry ruled England personally, rather than governing through senior ministers. He travelled less than previous monarchs, investing heavily in a handful of his favourite [[Castles in Great Britain and Ireland#Palace-fortresses|palaces and castles]]. He married [[Eleanor of Provence]], with whom he had five children. Henry was known for his [[piety]], holding lavish religious ceremonies and giving generously to charities; the King was particularly devoted to the figure of [[Edward the Confessor]], whom he adopted as his [[patron saint]]. He extracted huge sums of money from the [[History of the Jews in England|Jews in England]], ultimately crippling their ability to do business, and as attitudes towards the Jews hardened, he introduced the [[Statute of Jewry]], attempting to segregate the community. In a fresh attempt to reclaim his family's lands in France, he [[Saintonge War|invaded Poitou]] in 1242, leading to the disastrous [[Battle of Taillebourg]]. After this, Henry relied on diplomacy, cultivating an alliance with [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II]]. Henry supported his brother [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard]] in his bid to become [[King of the Romans]] in 1256, but was unable to place his own son [[Edmund Crouchback|Edmund]] on the throne of [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], despite investing large amounts of money. He planned to go on [[crusade]] to the [[Levant]], but was prevented from doing so by rebellions in [[Gascony]].

By 1258, Henry's rule was increasingly unpopular, the result of the failure of his expensive foreign policies and the notoriety of his [[Poitiers|Poitevin]] half-brothers, the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]], as well as the role of his local officials in collecting taxes and debts. A coalition of his barons, initially probably backed by Eleanor, seized power in a coup d'état and expelled the Poitevins from England, reforming the royal government through a process called the [[Provisions of Oxford]]. Henry and the baronial government enacted a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace with France]] in 1259, under which Henry gave up his rights to his other lands in France in return for [[Louis IX of France|King Louis IX of France]] recognising him as the rightful ruler of Gascony. The baronial regime collapsed but Henry was unable to reform a stable government and instability across England continued.

In 1263 one of the more radical barons, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], seized power, resulting in the [[Second Barons' War]]. Henry persuaded Louis to support his cause and mobilised an army. The [[Battle of Lewes]] occurred in 1264, where Henry was defeated and taken prisoner. Henry's eldest son, [[Edward I of England|Edward]], escaped from captivity to defeat de Montfort at the [[Battle of Evesham]] the following year and freed his father. Henry initially enacted a harsh revenge on the remaining rebels, but was persuaded by the Church to mollify his policies through the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]]. Reconstruction was slow and Henry had to acquiesce to various measures, including further suppression of the Jews, to maintain baronial and popular support. Henry died in 1272, leaving Edward as his successor. He was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]], which he had rebuilt in the second half of his reign, and was moved to his current tomb in 1290. Some [[miracle]]s were declared after his death but he was not [[Canonization|canonised]].<!--The statement about Henry's length of reign was removed after Talk Page discussion.

At the start of the 13th century, the [[Kingdom of England]] formed part of [[Angevin empire|an empire]] spreading across Western Europe. Henry was named after his grandfather, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who had built up this vast network of lands stretching from Scotland and Wales, through England, across the [[English Channel]] to the territories of [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]], [[Duchy of Brittany|Brittany]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]] and [[County of Anjou|Anjou]] in north-west France, onto [[Poitou]] and [[Gascony]] in the south-west.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=191–192}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> For many years the French Crown was relatively weak, enabling first Henry II, and then his sons [[Richard I of England|Richard]] and John, to dominate France.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=145–147}}</ref>

In 1204, John lost Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou to [[Philip II of France]], leaving English power on the continent limited to Gascony and Poitou.<ref name="Carpenter 2004 264–267">{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=264–267}}</ref> John raised taxes to pay for military campaigns to regain his lands, but unrest grew among many of the English barons; John sought new allies by declaring England a [[Papacy|Papal]] [[fiefdom]], owing allegiance to the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=271–274, 286}}</ref>{{efn|It was not particularly unusual for rulers in the early 13th century to give homage to the Pope in this way: Richard I had done similarly, as had the rulers of [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Denmark]], [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Poland]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] and [[Sweden]].<ref>{{harvnb|McGlynn|2013|p=73}}</ref>}} In 1215, John and the rebel barons negotiated a potential peace treaty, the ''[[Magna Carta]]''.

Henry was staying safely at [[Corfe Castle]] in Dorset with his mother when King John died.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=30}}</ref> On his deathbed, John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]], one of the most famous knights in England.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=14–15}}</ref> The loyalist leaders decided to crown Henry immediately to reinforce his claim to the throne.<ref name=Carpenter1990P13>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=13}}</ref>{{efn|Henry's speedy coronation was intended to draw a clear distinction between the young King and his rival Louis, who had only been elected by the barons and was never crowned.<ref name=Carpenter1990P13/>}} William knighted the boy, and Cardinal [[Guala Bicchieri]], the [[papal legate]] to England, then oversaw his coronation at [[Gloucester Cathedral]] on 28 October.<ref name="oxforddnb.com">{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=13}}; {{harvnb|McGlynn|2013|p=189}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> In the absence of the archbishops of [[Stephen Langton|Canterbury]] or [[Walter de Gray|York]], he was anointed by the bishops of [[Sylvester of Worcester|Worcester]] and [[Simon of Apulia|Exeter]], and crowned by Peter des Roches.<ref name="oxforddnb.com"/> The royal crown had been either lost or sold during the civil war, so instead the ceremony used a simple gold [[Corolla (chaplet)|corolla]] belonging to Queen Isabella.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=31}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=188}}</ref>

The young King inherited a difficult situation, with over half of England occupied by the rebels and most of his father's continental possessions still in French hands.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=1}}</ref> He had substantial support, however, from Guala who intended to win the civil war for Henry and punish the rebels.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|pp=259–260}}</ref> Guala set about strengthening the ties between England and the Papacy, starting with the coronation itself, where Henry gave [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to the Papacy, recognising the Pope as his feudal lord.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|p=260}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=13}}</ref> Pope Honorius declared that Henry was the Pope's [[vassal]] and [[Ward (law)|ward]], and that the legate had complete authority to protect Henry and his kingdom.<ref name=Carpenter1990P13/> As an additional measure, Henry took the cross, declaring himself a [[Crusades|crusader]] and so entitled to special protection from Rome.<ref name=Carpenter1990P13/>

Two senior nobles stood out as candidates to head Henry's regency government.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=16}}</ref> The first was William, who, although elderly, was renowned for his personal loyalty and could help support the war with his own men and material.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=15–16}}</ref> The second was [[Ranulf de Blondeville, 6th Earl of Chester|Ranulf de Blondeville]], the [[Earl of Chester]] and one of the most powerful loyalist barons.<ref name=Carpenter1990PP1617>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=16–17}}</ref> William diplomatically waited until both Guala and Ranulf had requested him to take up the post before assuming power.<ref name=Carpenter1990PP1617/>{{efn|Initially William Marshal termed himself the King's [[justiciar]].

The war was not going well for the loyalists and the new regency government considered retreating to Ireland.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=19}}</ref> Prince Louis and the rebel barons, however, were also finding it difficult to make further progress. Despite Louis controlling [[Westminster Abbey]], he could not be crowned king because the [[Christianity in England|English Church]] and the Papacy backed Henry.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=301}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=19–21}}</ref> John's death had defused some of the rebel concerns, and the royal castles were still holding out in the occupied parts of the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|p=30}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=19–21}}</ref> In a bid to take advantage of this, Henry encouraged the rebel barons to come back to his cause in exchange for the return of their lands, and reissued a version of the ''Magna Carta'', albeit having first removed some of the clauses, including those unfavourable to the Papacy.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=21–22, 24–25}}</ref> The move was not successful and opposition to Henry's new government hardened.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=25}}</ref>

In February, Louis set sail for France to gather reinforcements.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=27}}</ref> In his absence, arguments broke out between Louis's French and English followers, and Cardinal Guala declared that Henry's war against the rebels was a religious crusade.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=28–29}}</ref>{{efn|The status of Henry's campaign was slightly ambiguous. Pope Innocent IV declared the rebels to be worse than Saracens, but they were not considered heretics; the crusader cross was to be worn on the chest, rather than on the more conventional shoulder; joining this crusade was not the equivalent of fighting in the east, or replace an existing vow. It did, however, provide a convenient excuse for many rebels to switch back to the King's side without suffering a loss of face.<ref>{{harvnb|McGlynn|2013|p=198}}; {{harvnb|Tyerman|1996|pp=141–142}}</ref>}} This resulted in a series of defections from the rebel movement, and the tide of the conflict swung in Henry's favour.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=27–28}}</ref> Louis returned at the end of April and reinvigorated his campaign, splitting his forces into two groups, sending one north to besiege [[Lincoln Castle]] and keeping one in the south to capture [[Dover Castle]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=31, 36}}</ref> When he learnt that Louis had divided his army, William Marshal gambled on defeating the rebels in a single battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=36}}</ref> William marched north and attacked [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]] on 20 May; entering through a side gate, he [[Battle of Lincoln (1217)|took the city]] in a sequence of fierce street battles and sacked the buildings.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=36–40}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=302}}; {{harvnb|McGlynn|2013|p=216}}</ref> Large numbers of senior rebels were captured, and historian David Carpenter considers the battle to be "one of the most decisive in English history".<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=39–40}}</ref>{{efn|The French rebel leader, Thomas the Count of Perche, was one of the few actual casualties among the rebel leadership, and died as the result of an accidental spear-thrust through the visor, and after the battle his death was deeply regretted by both sides.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=302}}</ref>}}

===Restoring royal authority===
[[File:Jindra3.jpg|thumb|alt=Sketch of Henry's second coronation|Matthew Paris's depiction of the second coronation of Henry in 1220]]
With the end of the civil war, Henry's government faced the task of rebuilding royal authority across large parts of the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=50–51}}</ref> By the end of 1217 many former rebels were routinely ignoring instructions from the centre, and even Henry's loyalist supporters jealously maintained their independent control over royal castles.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=1}}</ref> Illegally constructed fortifications, called [[adulterine castle]]s, had sprung up across much of the country. The network of county [[sheriff]]s had collapsed, and with it the ability to raise taxes and collect royal revenues.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=70–71}}</ref> The powerful Welsh [[Llywelyn the Great|Prince Llywelyn]] posed a major threat in Wales and along the [[Welsh Marches]].<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=321}}; {{harvnb|McGlynn|2013|pp=189, 223}}</ref>

Despite his success in winning the war, William had far less success in restoring royal power following the peace.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=55–56, 108–109}}</ref> In part, this was because William was unable to offer significant patronage, despite the expectations from the loyalist barons that they would be rewarded.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=18, 51}}</ref>{{efn|The Crown had traditionally relied on gifts and bribes to encourage loyalty and obedience among the barons, but in the straightened, post-war circumstances the opportunities to dispense such patronage was limited.

The fate of Henry's family lands in France still remained uncertain.

===Richard Marshal's revolt===
Henry's chief minister, Hubert de Burgh fell from power in 1232.

Des Roches used his new authority to begin stripping his opponents of their estates, circumventing the courts and legal process.<ref name=Carpenter2004PP313314/> Complaints from powerful barons such as William Marshal's son [[Richard Marshal, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Richard]] grew, and they argued that Henry was failing to protect their legal rights as described in the 1225 charters.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=314}}</ref> A fresh civil war broke out between des Roches and Richard's followers.<ref name=Carpenter2004P315>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=315}}</ref> Des Roches sent armies into Richard's lands in Ireland and [[South Wales]].<ref name=Carpenter2004P315/> In response, Richard allied himself with Prince Llywelyn, and his own supporters rose up in rebellion in England.<ref name=Carpenter2004P315/> Henry was unable to gain a clear military advantage and became concerned that Louis of France might seize the opportunity to invade Brittany – where the truce was about to expire – while he was distracted at home.<ref name=Carpenter2004P315/>

[[Edmund Rich]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, intervened in 1234 and held several great councils, advising Henry to accept the dismissal of des Roches.<ref name=Carpenter2004P315/> Henry agreed to make peace, but, before the negotiations were completed, Richard died of wounds suffered in battle, leaving his younger brother [[Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Gilbert]] to inherit his lands.<ref name=Carpenter2004PP315316>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=315–316}}</ref> The final settlement was confirmed in May, and Henry was widely praised for his humility in submitting to the slightly embarrassing peace.<ref name=Carpenter2004PP315316/> Meanwhile, the truce with France in Brittany finally expired, and Henry's ally Duke Peter came under fresh military pressure.<ref name=Carpenter2004P316>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=316}}</ref> Henry could only send a small force of soldiers to assist, and Brittany fell to Louis in November.<ref name=Carpenter2004P316/> For the next 24 years, Henry ruled the kingdom personally, rather than through senior ministers.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=338}}</ref>

[[File:Heinrichus tercius.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Engraving of Great Seal|Engraving of Henry's [[Great Seal of the Realm|great seal]]]]
Royal government in England had traditionally centred on several great offices of state, filled by powerful, independent members of the baronage.<ref name=Carpenter2004P353>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=353}}</ref> Henry abandoned this policy, leaving the post of justiciar vacant and turning the position of [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|chancellor]] into a more junior role.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=407–408}}</ref> A small royal council was formed but its role was ill-defined; appointments, patronage and policy were decided personally by Henry and his immediate advisers, rather than through the larger councils that had marked his early years.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=409}}</ref> The changes made it much harder for those outside Henry's inner circle to influence policy or to pursue legitimate grievances, particularly against the King's friends.<ref name=Carpenter2004P353/>

The term "[[Parliament of England|parliament]]" first appeared in the 1230s and 1240s to describe large gatherings of the royal court, and parliamentary gatherings were held periodically throughout Henry's reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|pp=382–383}}</ref> They were used to agree the raising of taxes which, in the 13th century, were single, one-off levies, typically on [[movable property]], intended to support the King's normal revenues for particular projects.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=355}}</ref>{{efn|In addition to taxes, the other main source of royal income were the royal manors, which produced revenue through a system called the county farms, traditionally collected through the local sheriffs.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=2–3}}</ref> In 1236 this system was reformed, to avoid the risk of money being misappropriated by the sheriffs; revenues increased by roughly 10 percent, but were still inadequate to support Henry's policies in Europe.<ref name="Jobson 2012 3">{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=3}}</ref>}} During Henry's reign, the counties began to send regular delegations to these parliaments, and came to represent a broader cross-section of the community than simply the major barons.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|pp=390–391}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=356}}</ref>

Despite the various charters, the provision of royal justice was inconsistent and driven by the needs of immediate politics: sometimes action would be taken to address a legitimate baronial complaint, on other occasions the problem would simply be ignored.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|pp=26, 29, 37, 43}}</ref> The royal [[Eyre (legal term)|eyres]], courts which toured the country to provide justice at the local level, typically for those lesser barons and the gentry claiming grievances against the major lords, had little power, allowing the major barons to dominate the local justice system.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=105}}</ref> The power of royal sheriffs also declined during Henry's reign.

The royal court was formed round Henry's trusted friends, such as [[Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester|Richard de Clare]], the brothers [[Hugh Bigod (Justiciar)|Hugh]] and [[Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk|Roger Bigod]] and [[Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]] and Henry's brother, Richard.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=342–343}}</ref> Henry wanted to use his court to unite his English and continental subjects, and it included [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]], originally a French knight who had married Henry's sister Eleanor and become the [[Earl of Leicester]], in addition to the later influxes of Henry's [[County of Savoy|Savoyard]] and [[County of La Marche|Lusignan]] relatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|pp=95, 98, 220}}</ref> The court followed European styles and traditions, and was heavily influenced by Henry's Angevin family traditions: French was the spoken language, it had close links to the royal courts of France, [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], and Henry sponsored the same writers as the other European rulers.<ref>{{harvnb|Vincent|2006|pp=150–151}}; {{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=2}}</ref>

Henry was particularly supportive of the [[mendicant orders]]; his [[confessor]]s were drawn from the [[Dominican Order|Dominican Friars]], and he built mendicant houses in [[Canterbury]], [[Norwich]], [[Oxford]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] and [[York]], helping to find valuable space for new buildings in what were already crowded towns and cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Robson|2010|p=125}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> He supported the [[Military order (society)|military crusading orders]], and became a patron of the [[Teutonic Order]] in 1235.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|1996|p=112}}</ref> The emerging universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] also received royal attention: Henry reinforced and regulated their powers, and encouraged scholars to migrate from [[University of Paris|Paris]] to teach at them.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=463}}; {{harvnb|Senocak|2012|pp=58–59}}</ref> A [[University of Northampton (thirteenth century)|rival institution at Northampton]] was declared by the King to be a mere school and not a true university.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=464}}</ref>

===Jewish policies===
{{Details|History of the Jews in England|the Jews in 13th-century England}}
The [[Jews]] of England were considered the property of the Crown, and they had traditionally been used as a source of [[Economy of England in the Middle Ages#Jewish contribution to the English economy|cheap loans and easy taxation]], in exchange for royal protection against [[antisemitism#Persecutions in the Middle Ages|antisemitism]].<ref name="Jobson 2012 3"/> The Jews had suffered considerable oppression during the First Barons' War, but during Henry's early years the community had flourished and became one of the most prosperous in Europe.<ref>{{harvnb|Stacey|2003|pp=41, 48}}; {{harvnb|Hillaby|2003|p=37}}</ref> This was primarily the result of the stance taken by the regency government, which took a range of measures to protect the Jews and encourage lending.<ref name=Hillaby2004P37/> This was driven by financial self-interest, as they stood to profit considerably from a strong Jewish community in England.<ref name=Hillaby2004P37/> Their policy ran counter to the instructions being sent from the Pope, however, who had laid out strong anti-Jewish measures at the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215; William Marshal continued with his policy despite complaints from the Church.<ref name=Hillaby2004P37>{{harvnb|Hillaby|2003|p=37}}</ref>

In 1239 Henry introduced different policies, possibly trying to imitate those of Louis of France: Jewish leaders across England were imprisoned and forced to pay fines equivalent to a third of their goods, and any outstanding loans were to be released.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=3}}; {{harvnb|Stacey|2003|p= 49}}</ref> Further huge demands for cash followed – £40,000 was demanded in 1244, for example, of which around two-thirds was collected within five years – destroying the ability of the Jewish community to lend money commercially.<ref>{{harvnb|Stacey|2003|pp=49–50}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Henry had built the ''[[Domus Conversorum]]'' in London in 1232 to help convert Jews to Christianity, and efforts intensified after 1239; as many as 10 percent of the Jews in England had been converted by the late 1250s.<ref>{{harvnb|Stacey|2003|p=51}}</ref> Anti-Jewish stories involving [[Blood libel|tales of child sacrifice]] flourished in the 1250s and, in response, Henry passed the [[Statute of Jewry]] in 1253, which attempted to segregate Jews and enforce the wearing of [[Yellow badge|Jewish badges]]; it remains unclear to what extent this statute was actually implemented by Henry.<ref>{{harvnb|Stacey|2003|pp=51–52}}</ref>

Ireland was important to Henry, both as a source of royal revenue – an average of £1,150 was sent from Ireland to the Crown each year during the middle of his reign – and as a source of estates that could be granted to his supporters.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=361}}</ref>{{efn|name=Money}} The major landowners looked eastwards towards Henry's court for political leadership, and many also possessed estates in Wales and England.<ref>{{harvnb|Frame|1992|pp=184–185}}</ref> The 1240s saw major upheavals in land ownership due to deaths among the barons, enabling Henry to redistribute Irish lands to his supporters.<ref>{{harvnb|Frame|1992|pp=192–194}}</ref> In the 1250s, the King gave out numerous grants of land along the frontier in Ireland to his supporters, creating a buffer zone against the [[Irish people|native Irish]]; the local [[List of High Kings of Ireland|Irish kings]] began to suffer increased harassment as English power increased across the region.<ref>{{harvnb|Frame|1992|pp=199–200}}</ref> These lands were in many cases unprofitable for the barons to hold and English power reached its zenith under Henry for the medieval period.<ref>{{harvnb|Frame|1992|pp=179, 201}}</ref> In 1254, Henry granted Ireland to his son, Edward, on condition that it would never be separated from the Crown.<ref name="Carpenter 2004 362"/>

===European strategy===

Henry had no further opportunities to reconquer his possessions in France after the collapse of his military campaign at Taillebourg.<ref name=ODNB/> Henry's resources were quite inadequate in comparison to those of the French Crown, and by the end of the 1240s it was clear that King Louis had become the preeminent power across France.<ref>{{harvnb|Aurell|2003|pp=30–31}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=275}}</ref> Henry instead adopted what historian [[Michael Clanchy]] has described as a "European strategy", attempting to regain his lands in France through diplomacy rather than force, building alliances with other states prepared to put military pressure on the French King.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Clanchy|1998|p=220}}</ref> In particular, Henry cultivated Frederick II, hoping he would turn against Louis or allow his nobility to join Henry's campaigns.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|pp=104–107}}</ref> In the process, Henry's attention became increasingly focused on European politics and events rather than domestic affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiler|2012|p=4}}</ref>

Henry's crusade never departed, as he was forced to deal with problems in Gascony, where the harsh policies of the King's lieutenant, Simon de Montfort, had provoked a violent uprising in 1252, which was supported by King [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]] of neighbouring Castile.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=345}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=342}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=12}}</ref> The English court was split over the problem: Simon and Eleanor argued that the Gascons were to blame for the crisis, while Henry, backed by the Lusignans, blamed Simon's misjudgment.<ref name=ODNB/> Henry and Eleanor quarrelled over the issue and were not reconciled until the following year.<ref name=ODNB/> Forced to intervene personally, Henry carried out an effective, if expensive, campaign with the help of the Lusignans and stabilised the province.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=345}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=342}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950| publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Alfonso signed a treaty of alliance in 1254, and  Gascony was  given to Henry's son Edward, who married Alfonso's half-sister Eleanor, delivering a long-lasting peace with Castile.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=345}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=342–343}}</ref>

==Later reign (1258–72)==

===Revolution===
[[File:Gal nations edward i - trimmed.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Edward I|Probable late 13th or early 14th-century depiction of Henry's eldest son, Edward]]
In 1258, Henry faced a revolt among the English barons.<ref>{{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 152–153}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=347}}</ref> Anger had grown about the way the King's officials were raising funds, the influence of the Poitevins at court and his unpopular Sicilian policy; even the English Church had grievances over its treatment by the King.<ref>{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 153}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=347–349}}</ref> The Welsh were still in open revolt, and now allied themselves with Scotland.<ref name=ODNB/> Henry was also critically short of money; although he still had some reserves of gold and silver, they were totally insufficient to cover his potential expenditures, including the campaign for Sicily and his debts to the Papacy.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|pp=122–123}}</ref> Critics suggested darkly that he had never really intended to join the crusades, and was simply intending to profit from the crusading tithes.<ref>{{harvnb|Tyerman|1996|pp=113–114}}</ref> To compound the situation, the harvests in England failed.<ref name=ODNB/> Within Henry's court there was a strong feeling that the King would be unable to lead the country through these problems.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=99}}</ref>

The discontent finally erupted in April, when seven of the major English and Savoyard barons – Simon de Montfort, Roger and Hugh Bigod, [[John Fitzgeoffrey]], [[Peter de Montfort]], Peter de Savoy and Richard de Clare – secretly formed an alliance to expel the Lusignans from court, a move probably quietly supported by the Queen.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=18–19}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 153}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> On 30 April, Roger Bigod marched into Westminster in the middle of the King's parliament, backed by his co-conspirators, and carried out a coup d'état.<ref>{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 153}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|1996|p=99}}</ref> Henry, fearful that he was about to be arrested and imprisoned, agreed to abandon his policy of personal rule and instead govern through a council of 24 barons and churchmen, half chosen by the King and half by the barons.<ref>{{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 154–154}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=20}}</ref> His own nominees to the council, however, drew heavily on the hated Lusignans.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=21}}</ref>

The pressure for reform continued to grow unabated and a fresh parliament met in June, passing a set of measures known as the [[Provisions of Oxford]], which Henry swore to uphold.<ref>{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 156}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=22, 25}}</ref> These provisions created a smaller council of 15 members, elected solely by the barons, which then had the power to appoint England's justiciar, chancellor and treasurer, and which would be monitored through triannual parliaments.<ref>{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 156}}</ref>{{efn|The actual election procedure for the council was, as historian Adrian Jobson describes, "rather convoluted"; the twelve Royalist members of the first, Bigod-inspired council elected two nominees, followed by the twelve baronial members electing an additional two nominees; these four men would then elect the remainder of the council. The result was a heavily baronial council.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=24}}</ref>}} Pressure from the lesser barons and the gentry present at Oxford also helped to push through wider reform, intended to limit the abuse of power by both the King's officials and the major barons.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=22–23}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=371}}</ref> The elected council included representatives of the Savoyard faction but no Poitevins, and the new government immediately took steps to exile the leading Lusignans and to seize key castles across the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 156–157}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=25}}</ref>

The disagreements between the leading barons involved in the revolt soon became evident.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=33}}</ref> De Montfort championed radical reforms that would place further limitations on the authority and power of the major barons as well as the Crown; others, such as Hugh Bigod, promoted only moderate change, while the conservative barons, such as de Clare, expressed concerns about the existing limitations on the King's powers.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=33–34}}</ref> Henry's son, Edward, initially opposed the revolution, but then allied himself with de Montfort, helping him to pass the radical [[Provisions of Westminster]] in 1259, which introduced further limits on the major barons and local royal officials.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=26, 38–43}}</ref>

===Crisis===
[[File:Louis9+Henri3+StDenis.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Painting of Henry and Louis IX|14th-century representation of Henry visiting Louis IX of France]]
Over the next four years, neither Henry nor the barons were able to restore stability in England, and power swung back and forth between the different factions.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=372–377}}</ref> One of the priorities for the new regime, however, was to settle the long-running dispute with France and, at the end of 1259, Henry and Eleanor left for Paris to negotiate the final details of a [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|peace treaty]] with King Louis, escorted by Simon de Montfort and much of the baronial government.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=21, 45–46}}</ref> Under the treaty, Henry gave up any claim to his family's lands in the north of France, but was confirmed as the legitimate ruler of Gascony and various neighbouring territories in the south, giving homage and recognising Louis as his feudal lord for these possessions.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=46}}</ref>

When de Montfort returned to England, Henry, supported by Eleanor, remained in Paris where he seized the opportunity to reassert royal authority and began to issue royal orders independently of the barons.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=47}}</ref> Henry finally returned to retake power in England in April 1260, where conflict was brewing between de Clare's forces and those of de Montfort and Edward.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=51–52}}</ref> Henry's brother Richard mediated between the parties and averted a military confrontation; Edward was reconciled with his father and de Montfort was put on trial for his actions against the King.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=51–53}}</ref> Henry was unable to maintain his grip on power, however, and in October a coalition headed by de Montfort, de Clare and Edward briefly seized back control, but within months their baronial council had collapsed into chaos as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=54–56}}</ref>

Henry continued to publicly support the Provisions of Oxford, but he secretly opened discussions with [[Pope Urban IV]], hoping to be absolved from the oath he had made at Oxford.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=57–59}}</ref> In June 1261, the King announced that Rome had released him from his promises and he promptly held a counter-coup with the support of Edward.<ref name=Jobson2012PP6164>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=61–64, 66}}</ref> He purged the ranks of the sheriffs of his enemies and seized back control of many of the royal castles.<ref name=Jobson2012PP6164/> The baronial opposition, led by de Montfort and de Clare, were temporarily reunited in their opposition to Henry's actions, convening their own parliament, independent of the King, and establishing a rival system of local government across England.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=64–67, 69}}</ref> Henry and Eleanor mobilised their own supporters and raised a foreign mercenary army.<ref name=Jobson2012PP70>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=70–71}}</ref> Facing the threat of open civil war, the barons backed down: de Clare switched sides once again, de Montfort left for exile in France and the baronial resistance collapsed.<ref name=Jobson2012PP70/>

Henry's government relied primarily on Eleanor and her Savoyard supporters, and it proved short-lived.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=77}}</ref> He attempted to settle the crisis permanently by forcing the barons to agree to the [[Treaty of Kingston]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=73}}</ref> This treaty introduced a system of arbitration to settle outstanding disputes between the King and the barons, using Richard as an initial adjudicator, backed up by Louis of France should Richard fail to generate a compromise.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=73–74}}</ref> Henry softened some of his policies in response to the concerns of the barons, but he soon began to target his political enemies and recommence his unpopular Sicilian policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=74–76}}</ref> Henry's government was weakened by the death of de Clare, as his heir, Gilbert, sided with the radicals; the King's position was further undermined by major Welsh incursions along the Marches and the Pope's decision to reverse his judgement on the Provisions, this time confirming them as legitimate.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=79–82}}</ref> By early 1263, Henry's authority had disintegrated and the country slipped back towards open civil war.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=84}}</ref>

De Montfort's coalition began to quickly fragment, Henry regained his freedom of movement and renewed chaos spread across England.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=100}}</ref> Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute, as had been laid out in the Treaty of Kingston; de Montfort was initially hostile to this idea, but, as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=100–103}}</ref> Henry went to Paris in person, accompanied by de Montfort's representatives.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=103}}</ref> Initially de Montfort's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the [[Mise of Amiens]], condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=13–105}}; {{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=283}}</ref> Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons, but was also influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=283}}</ref>{{efn|The wording of Louis's judgement in the case also appears to suggest that the French King believed that he had feudal authority over Henry in his role as King of England, as a consequence of Henry having given homage to him for Gascony.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|p=337}}</ref>}} Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements, Henry returned to England in February 1264, where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=107–109}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 208}}</ref>

The [[Second Barons' War]] finally broke out in April 1264, when Henry led an army into de Montfort's territories in the Midlands, and then advanced south-east to re-occupy the important route to France.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=109–112}}</ref> Becoming desperate, de Montfort marched in pursuit of Henry and the two armies met at the [[Battle of Lewes]] on 14 May.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=113–115}}</ref> Despite their numerical superiority, Henry's forces were overwhelmed.<ref name=Jobson2012PP115>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=115, 117}}</ref> His brother Richard was captured, and Henry and Edward retreated to the local priory and surrendered the following day.<ref name=Jobson2012PP115/> Henry was forced to pardon the rebel barons and reinstate the Provisions of Oxford, leaving him, as historian Adrian Jobson describes, "little more than a figurehead".<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=117, 122}}</ref>

De Montfort was unable to consolidate his victory and widespread disorder persisted across the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=119–120}}</ref> In France, Eleanor made plans for an invasion of England with the support of Louis, while Edward escaped his captors in May and formed a new army.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=120–121, 136–137}}</ref> Edward pursued de Monfort's forces through the Marches, before striking east to attack his fortress at Kenilworth and then turning once more on the rebel leader himself.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=138–141}}</ref> De Montfort, accompanied by the captive Henry, was unable to retreat and the [[Battle of Evesham]] ensued.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=140–142, 144}}</ref> Edward was triumphant and de Montfort's corpse was mutilated by the victors; Henry, who was wearing borrowed armour, was almost killed by Edward's forces during the fighting before they recognised the King and escorted him to safety.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=140–146}}</ref> In places the now leaderless rebellion dragged on, with some rebels gathering at Kenilworth, which Henry and Edward took after a long siege in 1266.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=149–152, 154–157}}</ref> The remaining pockets of resistance were mopped up, and the final rebels, holed up in the [[Isle of Ely]], surrendered in July 1267, marking the end of the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=381}}; {{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=155}}</ref>

===Reconciliation and reconstruction===
Henry quickly took revenge on his enemies after the Battle of Evesham.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=150}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=381}}</ref> He immediately ordered the [[Sequestration (law)|sequestration]] of all the rebel lands, triggering a wave of chaotic looting across the country.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=150–151}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=381}}</ref> Henry initially rejected any calls for moderation, but in October 1266 he was persuaded by the Papal Legate, [[Pope Adrian V|Ottobuono de' Fieschi]], to issue a less draconian policy, called the [[Dictum of Kenilworth]], which allowed for the return of the rebels' lands, in exchange for the payment of harsh fines.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=152, 156–157}}</ref> The [[Statute of Marlborough]] followed in November 1267, which effectively reissued much of the Provisions of Westminster, placing limitations on the powers of local royal officials and the major barons, but without restricting central royal authority.<ref name="Jobson 2012 162–163">{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=162–163}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=382}}</ref> Most of the exiled Poitevins began to return to England after the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Ridgeway|1988|pp=91–92}}</ref> In September 1267 Henry made the [[Treaty of Montgomery]] with Llywelyn, recognising him as the Prince of Wales and giving substantial land concessions.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=161–162}}</ref>

In the final years of his reign, Henry was increasingly infirm and focused on securing peace within the kingdom and his own religious devotions.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 246–247}}</ref> Edward became the Steward of England and began to play a more prominent role in government.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|pp=164–165}}</ref> Henry's finances were in a precarious state as a result of the war, and when Edward decided to join the crusades in 1268 it became clear that fresh taxes were necessary.<ref name="Jobson 2012 162–163"/> Henry was concerned that Edward's absence might encourage further revolts, but was swayed by his son to negotiate with multiple parliaments over the next two years to raise the money.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=382}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|pp= 248–249}}</ref> De Montfort had exacted harsh penalties on the Jews which Henry initially reversed, but he reintroduced a range of anti-Jewish measures under pressure from parliament in the final years of his reign.<ref>{{harvnb|Stacey|2003|p=53}}</ref> Henry continued to invest in Westminster Abbey, which became a replacement for the Angevin mausoleum at [[Fontevraud Abbey]], and in 1269 he oversaw a grand ceremony to rebury Edward the Confessor in a lavish new shrine, personally helping to carry the body to its new resting place.<ref>{{harvnb|Jobson|2012|p=165}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=382}}; {{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 247}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

Eleanor probably hoped that Henry would be recognised as a saint, as his contemporary Louis IX of France had been; indeed, Henry's final tomb resembled the shrine of a saint, complete with niches possibly intended to hold relics.<ref>{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 306}}; {{harvnb|Vincent|2006|p=194}}</ref> When the King's body was exhumed in 1290, contemporaries noted that the body was in perfect condition and that Henry's long beard remained well preserved, which at the time was considered to be an indication of saintly purity.<ref>{{harvnb|Stacey|1997|p=86}}; {{harvnb|Duffy|2003|p=79}};{{harvnb|Howell|2001|p= 306}}</ref> Miracles began to be reported at the tomb, but Edward was sceptical about these stories.

===Historiography===
[[File:Magna Carta (1225 version).jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of the Great Charter|The [[Magna Carta#The Great Charter 1225|Great Charter of 1225]]]]
The first histories of Henry's reign emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries, relying primarily on the accounts of medieval chroniclers, in particular writings of [[Roger of Wendover]] and [[Matthew Paris]].<ref name=ODNB/> These early historians, including Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]], were influenced by contemporary concerns about the roles of the Church and state, and examined the changing nature of kingship under Henry, the emergence of English nationalism during the period and what they perceived to be the malign influence of the Papacy.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950| publisher=Oxford University Press}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=261}}</ref> During the [[English Civil War]], historians also drew parallels between Henry's experiences and those of the deposed [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=261}}</ref>

By the 19th century, Victorian scholars such as [[William Stubbs]], James Ramsay, and [[William Hunt (priest)|William Hunt]] sought to understand how the English political system had evolved under Henry.<ref name=ODNB/> They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England.<ref name=ODNB/> This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as [[Kate Norgate]]'s 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|pp=4–5}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

After 1900, the financial and official records from Henry's reign began to become accessible to historians, including the [[pipe rolls]], court records, correspondence and records of administration of the royal forests.<ref>Carpenter 1990, p.5; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> [[Thomas Frederick Tout|Thomas Tout]] made extensive use of these new sources in the 1920s, and post-war historians brought a particular focus on the finances of Henry's government, highlighting his fiscal difficulties.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|1990|p=5}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> This wave of research culminated in Sir [[F. M. Powicke|Maurice Powicke]]'s two major biographical works on Henry, published in 1948 and 1953, which formed the established history of the King for the next three decades.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950| publisher=Oxford University Press}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=12}}</ref>

Henry's reign did not receive much attention from historians for many years after the 1950s: no substantial biographies of Henry were written after Powicke's, and the historian John Beeler observed in the 1970s that the coverage of Henry's reign by military historians remained particularly thin.<ref>{{harvnb|Beeler|1972|p=50}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=12}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> At the end of the 20th century, however, there was a renewed interest in 13th-century English history, resulting in the publication of various specialist works on aspects of Henry's reign, including government finance and the period of Henry's minority.<ref name=ODNB/> Current historiography notes both Henry's positive and negative qualities: historian [[David Carpenter (historian)|David Carpenter]] judges Henry to have been a decent man, who failed as a ruler due to his naivety and inability to produce realistic plans for reform, a theme echoed by Huw Ridgeway, who also notes his unworldliness and inability to manage his court, but who considers him to have been "essentially a man of peace, kind and merciful".<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=338–340}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/12950 | title=Henry III (1207–1272) | website = Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edition| publication-date = September 2010 | year = 2004 | last = Ridgeway | first = Huw W. | accessdate=17 August 2013 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6Iak4PVrC | archivedate = 3 August 2013 | mode=cs2 | doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/12950 | publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>

===Popular culture===
Henry's life was depicted in a series of contemporary illustrations sketched and water-coloured by the chronicler Matthew Paris, mostly drawn in the margins of the ''Chronica majora''.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1987|pp=201–207}}; {{harvnb|Davis|2013|p=105}}</ref> Paris first met Henry in 1236 and enjoyed an extended relationship with the King, although Paris disliked many of Henry's actions and the illustrations are frequently unflattering.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|1987|pp=201–207}}</ref> Henry was also shown in the poetry of his Italian contemporary [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]], who depicted Henry in the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' as an example of a negligent ruler, sitting alone in [[Purgatory]] to one side of the other failed kings.<ref name=Fritts2008P466>{{harvnb|Fritts|2008|p=466}}</ref> It is unclear why he is shown separately from his contemporaries; possible explanations include that this is a code by Dante to show that England was not part of the Holy Roman Empire, or that it is a favourable comment on Henry himself, highlighting his unusual piety.<ref name=Fritts2008P466/> Unlike many other medieval kings, Henry did not feature significantly in the works of [[William Shakespeare]], and in the modern period he has not been a prominent subject for films, theatre or television, having only a minimal role in modern popular culture.<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|2013|pp=11–12}}</ref>
