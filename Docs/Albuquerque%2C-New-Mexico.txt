==Etymology==
[[File:FranciscoFernandezdelaCueva.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 8th Duke of Alburquerque|Francisco, Duke of Alburquerque]]]]
'''Albuquerque''' was named in honor of [[Francisco Fernández de la Cueva, 8th Duke of Alburquerque|Francisco, Duke of Alburquerque]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=P9oxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_eQFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3166%2C16837 | title=Odd names abound in this state | work=Reading Eagle | date=Jan 1, 1970 | accessdate=31 October 2015 | pages=2}}</ref> who was viceroy of [[New Spain]] from 1653 to 1660.

The growing village soon to become Albuquerque was named by provincial governor [[Francisco Cuervo y Valdes]]. Francisco's title referred to [[Alburquerque, Badajoz|the Spanish town of Alburquerque]], in the Spanish province of [[Badajoz]]. near [[Portugal]]. The name has two theories of origin which denote either Latin or Arabic roots. The first of which derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''albus quercus'' meaning "white oak".<ref>{{cite web|title=Albuquerque|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Albuquerque&allowed_in_frame=0}}</ref> This name was probably in reference to the prevalence of [[cork oak]]s in the region, which have a white wood when the bark is removed. Alburquerque is still a center of the Spanish cork industry,<ref>James J. Parsons. The Cork Oak Forests and the Evolution of the Cork Industry in Southern Spain and Portugal. 1962. Clark University</ref> and the town coat-of-arms features a white cork oak.<ref>Brochure "Alburquerque: Villa Medieval" Excmo. Ayuntamiento de Alburquerque and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. 2006</ref> Another theory suggests that it may come from the Arabic Abu al-Qurq, which means "father of the cork [oak]".

The first "r" in Alburquerque was later dropped, probably due to association with the prominent general [[Alfonso de Albuquerque]], whose family title (among others), and then name, originated from the border Spanish town, but used a variant spelling in their name. The change was also in part due to the fact that citizens found the original name difficult to pronounce.<ref>Eddie Pells, [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-21/local/me-4182_1_duke-city ''If in Doubt, You Can Just Call It Albuquirky''], Los Angeles Times, May 21, 1995.</ref>

Western folklore offers a different explanation, tracing the name Albuquerque to the [[Galician language|Galician]] word ''albaricoque'', meaning "apricot". The apricot was brought to New Mexico by Spanish settlers, possibly as early as 1743. As the story goes, the settlement was established near an apricot tree, and became known as ''La Ciudad de Albaricoque''. As frontiersmen were unable to correctly pronounce the Galician word, it became corrupted to "Albuquerque".<ref>L. B. Mitchell. The Meaning of the Name Albuquerque. Western Folklore, Vol. 8, No. 3 (Jul. 1949), pp. 255–256</ref>
==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Albuquerque, New Mexico}}
===Early settlers===
Albuquerque was founded in 1706 as the Spanish colonial outpost of ''Villa de Alburquerque''.<ref>{{Cite web|title = About - Albuquerque Historical Society|url = http://albuqhistsoc.org/who-we-are/|website = Albuquerque Historical Society|accessdate = 2016-01-04|language = en-US}}</ref>  Present-day Albuquerque retains much of its historical Spanish cultural heritage.

[[File:6.18.08OldTownAlbuquerqueByLuigiNovi6.jpg|thumb|left|{{center|Old Town Albuquerque Plaza}}]]

Albuquerque was a farming community and strategically located military outpost along the [[El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro|Camino Real]]. The town was also the sheep-herding center of the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmallstar.com/albuquerque_visitor_information.html#Albuquerques |title=History |publisher=Nmallstar.com |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}</ref> Spain established a presidio (military garrison) in Albuquerque in 1706. After 1821, Mexico also had a military garrison there. The town of Alburquerque was built in the traditional Spanish village pattern: a central [[plaza]] surrounded by government buildings, homes, and a church. This central plaza area has been preserved and is open to the public as a museum, cultural area, and center of commerce. It is referred to as "[[Old Town Albuquerque]]" or simply "Old Town." Historically it was sometimes referred to as "La Placita" (''little plaza'' in Spanish).  On the north side of Old Town Plaza is [[San Felipe de Neri Church]]. Built in 1793, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the city.<ref>{{cite web

After the American occupation of New Mexico, Albuquerque had a federal garrison and quartermaster depot, the Post of Albuquerque, from 1846 to 1867. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] Albuquerque was occupied in February 1862 by [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] troops under General [[Henry Hopkins Sibley]], who soon afterward advanced with his main body into northern New Mexico. During his retreat from [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops into Texas he made a stand on April 8, 1862, at Albuquerque and fought the [[Battle of Albuquerque]] against a detachment of Union soldiers commanded by Colonel [[Edward Canby|Edward R. S. Canby]]. This daylong engagement at long range led to few casualties.

[[File:Albuquerque (1880).jpg|thumb|Downtown Albuquerque in 1880]]

When the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad]] arrived in 1880, it bypassed the Plaza, locating the passenger depot and railyards about <span style="white-space:nowrap">2&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(3&nbsp;km)</span> east in what quickly became known as New Albuquerque or New Town. Many Anglo merchants, mountain men, and settlers slowly filtered into Albuquerque creating a major mercantile commercial center which is now [[Downtown Albuquerque]]. Due to a rising rate of violent crime, [[gunfighter|gunman]] [[Milton J. Yarberry|Milt Yarberry]] was appointed the town's first marshal that year. New Albuquerque was incorporated as a town in 1885, with [[Henry N. Jaffa]] its first mayor, and it was incorporated as a city in 1891.<ref name="Simmons">{{Cite book| last = Simmons | first = Marc | title = Albuquerque | publisher = University of New Mexico Press | location = Albuquerque | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8263-0627-6 }}</ref>{{Rp|232–233}} Old Town remained a separate community until the 1920s when it was absorbed by the city of Albuquerque.  [[Old Albuquerque High School]], the city's first public high school, was established in 1879. [[Congregation Albert]], a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] synagogue established in 1897, is the oldest continuing Jewish organization in the city.<ref name="congregationalbert.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.congregationalbert.org/|title=Home|work=congregationalbert.org}}</ref>

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Old Albuquerque High School Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|Old Albuquerque High, built in 1914 (Victorian and Gothic styles were used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries)]]

By 1900, Albuquerque boasted a population of 8,000 inhabitants and all the modern amenities, including an electric street railway connecting Old Town, New Town, and the recently established [[University of New Mexico]] campus on the East Mesa. In 1902, the famous Alvarado Hotel was built adjacent to the new passenger depot, and it remained a symbol of the city until it was razed in 1970 to make room for a parking lot. In 2002, the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] was built on the site in a manner resembling the old landmark. The large metro station functions as the downtown headquarters for the city's transit department. It also serves as an intermodal hub for local buses, [[Greyhound]] buses, [[Amtrak]] passenger trains, and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express|Rail Runner]] commuter rail line.

New Mexico's dry climate brought many [[tuberculosis]] patients to the city in search of a cure during the early 20th century, and several sanitaria sprang up on the [[West Mesa]] to serve them. Presbyterian Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital, two of the largest hospitals in the Southwest, had their beginnings during this period. Influential [[New Deal]]–era governor [[Clyde Tingley]] and famed Southwestern architect [[John Gaw Meem]] were among those brought to New Mexico by tuberculosis.

===Decades of growth===
[[File:Centralave2.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Central Avenue (Downtown Albuquerque), circa early 20th century]]
[[File:McCanna-Hubbell Building, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Many buildings from the 19th century remain in downtown today]]

The first travelers on [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] appeared in Albuquerque in 1926, and before long, dozens of motels, restaurants, and gift shops had sprung up along the roadside to serve them. Route 66 originally ran through the city on a north-south alignment along Fourth Street, but in 1937 it was realigned along [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]], a more direct east-west route. The intersection of Fourth and Central downtown was the principal crossroads of the city for decades. The majority of the surviving structures from the Route 66 era are on Central, though there are also some on Fourth. Signs between [[Bernalillo, New Mexico|Bernalillo]] and [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]] along the old route now have brown, historical highway markers denoting it as ''Pre-1937 Route 66.''

The establishment of [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] in 1939, [[Sandia Base]] in the early 1940s, and [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in 1949, would make Albuquerque a key player of the Atomic Age. Meanwhile, the city continued to expand outward onto the West Mesa, reaching a population of 201,189 by 1960. In 1990, it was 384,736 and in 2007 it was 518,271. In June 2007, Albuquerque was listed as the sixth fastest-growing city in America by [[CNN]] and the [[United States Census Bureau]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite news|author=Les Christie, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/06/27/real_estate/fastest_growing_cities/ |title=The fastest growing U.S. cities&nbsp;— June 28, 2007 |publisher=CNN |date=June 28, 2007 |accessdate=May 9, 2009}}</ref> In 1990, the Census Bureau reported Albuquerque's population as 34.5% Hispanic and 58.3% non-Hispanic white.<ref name="census1">{{cite web|title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html|accessdate=April 23, 2012}}</ref>

Albuquerque's downtown entered the same phase and development (decline, "urban renewal" with continued decline, and gentrification) as nearly every city across the United States. As Albuquerque spread outward, the downtown area fell into a decline. Many historic buildings were razed in the 1960s and 1970s to make way for new plazas, high-rises, and parking lots as part of the city's urban renewal phase. {{as of|2010}}, only recently has downtown come to regain much of its urban character, mainly through the construction of many new loft apartment buildings and the renovation of historic structures such as the [[KiMo Theater]], in the [[gentrification]] phase.

===New millennium===
During the 21st century, the Albuquerque population has continued to grow rapidly. The population of the city proper was estimated at 528,497 in 2009, up from 448,607 in the 2000 census.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Erick |last=Siermers |title=Managing Albuquerque's growth |url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2007/sep/17/albuquerque-metro-area-population-projected-reach-/|date=September 17, 2007  |accessdate=September 17, 2007}}</ref>
During 2005 and 2006, the city celebrated its tricentennial with a diverse program of cultural events.

The passage of the Planned Growth Strategy in 2002–2004 was the community's strongest effort to create a framework for a more balanced and sustainable approach to urban growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabq.gov/council/pgs.html |title=Planned Growth Strategy |publisher=Cabq.gov |date=March 19, 2007 |accessdate=July 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527172409/http://www.cabq.gov/council/pgs.html| archivedate= May 27, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

<blockquote>
A critical finding of the study is that many of the 'disconnects' between the public's preferences and what actually is taking place are caused by weak or non-existent implementation tools – rather than by inadequate policies, as contained in the City/County Comprehensive Plan and other already adopted legislation.

Urban sprawl is limited on three sides—by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] to the north, the [[Pueblo of Isleta|Isleta Pueblo]] and [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] to the south, and the [[Sandia Mountains]] to the east. Suburban growth continues at a strong pace to the west, beyond [[Petroglyph National Monument]], once thought to be a natural boundary to sprawl development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/petr/ |title=Petroglyph National Monument |publisher=Nps.gov |date=June 10, 2010 |accessdate=July 2, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528012548/http://www.nps.gov/petr/| archivedate= May 28, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Because of less-costly land and lower taxes, much of the growth in the metropolitan area is taking place outside of the city of Albuquerque itself. In Rio Rancho to the northwest, the communities east of the mountains, and the incorporated parts of [[Valencia County]], population growth rates approach twice that of Albuquerque. The primary cities in Valencia County are [[Los Lunas, New Mexico|Los Lunas]] and [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]], both of which are home to growing industrial complexes and new residential subdivisions. The mountain towns of [[Tijeras, New Mexico|Tijeras]], [[Edgewood, New Mexico|Edgewood]], and [[Moriarty, New Mexico|Moriarty]], while close enough to Albuquerque to be considered suburbs, have experienced much less growth compared to Rio Rancho, Bernalillo, Los Lunas, and Belen.  Limited water supply and rugged terrain are the main limiting factors for development in these towns. The [[Mid Region Council of Governments]] (MRCOG), which includes constituents from throughout the Albuquerque area, was formed to ensure that these governments along the middle Rio Grande would be able to meet the needs of their rapidly rising populations. MRCOG's cornerstone project is the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]]. In October 2013, the ''"Albuquerque Journal"'' reported Albuquerque as the third best city to own an investment property.<ref>Metcalf, Richard.“ ABQ third-best metro for making money owning rental housing.” ''Albuquerque Journal''.

==Geography==
[[File:Albuquerque satellite map.jpg|thumb|upright|Satellite image of Albuquerque taken by NASA]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Albuquerque has a total area of <span style="white-space:nowrap">{{convert|490.9|sqkm|disp=flip}}</span>, of which <span style="white-space:nowrap">{{convert|486.2|km2|disp=flip}}</span> is land and <span style="white-space:nowrap">{{convert|4.7|km2|disp=flip}}</span>, or 0.96%, is water.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US3502000| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Albuquerque city, New Mexico| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref>

Albuquerque lies within the northern, upper edges of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] ecoregion, based on long-term patterns of climate, associations of plants and wildlife, and landforms, including drainage patterns.<ref name=lcalabre>

Located in central New Mexico, the city also has noticeable influences from the adjacent [[Colorado Plateau]] semi-desert, Arizona–New Mexico Mountains, and Southwest plateaus and plains steppe ecoregions, depending on where one is located. Its main geographic connection lies with southern New Mexico, while culturally, Albuquerque is a crossroads of most of New Mexico.

Albuquerque has one of the highest elevations of any major city in the United States, though the effects of this are greatly tempered by its southwesterly continental position. The elevation of the city ranges from <span style="white-space:nowrap">4,900&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,490&nbsp;m)</span> [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] near the Rio Grande (in the Valley) to over <span style="white-space:nowrap">6,700&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,950&nbsp;m)</span> in the foothill areas of [[Sandia Heights, New Mexico|Sandia Heights]] and Glenwood Hills. At the airport, the elevation is <span style="white-space:nowrap">5,352&nbsp;feet&nbsp;(1,631&nbsp;m)</span> above sea level.

The Rio Grande is classified, like the [[Nile]], as an "exotic" river because it flows through a desert. The New Mexico portion of the Rio Grande lies within the [[Rio Grande Rift]] Valley, bordered by a system of [[fault (geology)|fault]]s, including those that lifted up the adjacent Sandia and [[Manzano Mountains]], while lowering the area where the life-sustaining Rio Grande now flows.

===Geology===
[[File:Sandia Peak Ski Area, Albuquerque AC, crop1.JPG|thumb|Sandia Peak Ski Area in the Sandia Mountains]]
Albuquerque lies in the [[Albuquerque Basin]], a portion of the [[Rio Grande rift]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/resources/water/projects/Albuquerque_basin.html

The [[Sandia Mountains]] are the predominant geographic feature visible in Albuquerque. "Sandía" is Spanish for "[[watermelon]]", and is popularly believed to be a reference to the brilliant coloration of the mountains at sunset: bright pink (melon meat) and green (melon rind). The pink is due to large exposures of [[granodiorite]] cliffs, and the green is due to large swaths of [[conifer]] forests. However, Robert Julyan notes in ''The Place Names of New Mexico'', "the most likely explanation is the one believed by the [[Sandia Pueblo]] Indians: the Spaniards, when they encountered the Pueblo in 1540, called it Sandia, because they thought the squash growing there were watermelons, and the name Sandia soon was transferred to the mountains east of the pueblo."<ref name="julyan">Robert Julyan, ''The Place Names of New Mexico'' (revised edition), UNM Press, 1998.</ref>  He also notes that the Sandia Pueblo Indians call the mountain ''Bien Mur'', "big mountain."<ref name="julyan"/>

The Sandia foothills, on the west side of the mountains, have soils derived from that same rock material with varying sizes of decomposed granite, mixed with areas of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] (a [[calcium carbonate]] deposit common in the arid southwestern USA), along with some exposed [[granite]] bedrock.
[[File:Albuquerque - aerial - Black Arroyo Dam and vicinity.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Albuquerque Basin]]

Below the foothills, the area usually called the "Northeast Heights" consists of a mix of clay and [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]] soils, overlain by a layer of decomposed granite, resulting from long-term outwash of that material from the adjacent mountains. This [[bajada (geography)|bajada]] is quite noticeable when driving into Albuquerque from the north or south, due to its fairly uniform slope from the mountains' edge downhill to the valley. Sand hills are scattered along the I-25 corridor and directly above the Rio Grande Valley, forming the lower end of the Heights.

The Rio Grande Valley, due to long-term shifting of the actual river channel, contains layers and areas of soils varying between [[caliche (mineral)|caliche]], clay, loam, and even some sand. It is the only part of Albuquerque where the [[water table]] often lies close to the surface, sometimes less than {{convert|10|ft|m}}.

The last significant area of Albuquerque geologically is the [[West Mesa]]: this is the elevated land west of the Rio Grande, including "West Bluff", the sandy terrace immediately west and above the river, and the rather sharply defined volcanic escarpment above and west of most of the developed city. The west mesa commonly has soils often referred to as "blow sand", along with occasional clay and caliche and even basalt, nearing the escarpment.

===Landscape===
{{wide image|Albuquerque_pano_sunset.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of the city of Albuquerque}}

===Climate===
Albuquerque has a cold [[semi-arid climate]] (''BWk'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]). Albuquerque is in the northern tip of the Chihuahuan Desert, near the edge of the [[Colorado Plateau]].<ref name=lcalabre/><ref name=ausherman/> The average annual precipitation is less than half of evaporation, and no month averages below freezing.

Albuquerque's climate is usually sunny and dry, with an average of 3,415 sunshine hours per year.<ref name= noaasun /><ref name= NOAA>{{cite web
  | url = http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/nm/290041.pdf
  | title = NCDC: U.S. Climate Normals
  | accessdate =October 31, 2010 }}</ref>  Brilliant sunshine defines the region, averaging 278&nbsp;days a year; periods of variably mid and high-level cloudiness temper the sun at other times. Extended cloudiness is rare. The city has four distinct seasons, but the heat and cold are mild compared to the extremes that occur more commonly in other parts of the country.

[[File:SnowyAlbuquerqueDowntown.JPG|thumb|Downtown Albuquerque after a snowstorm]]

Winters are rather brief, with December, the coolest month, averaging {{convert|36.3|°F|1}}, although low temperatures bottom out in January, and the coldest temperature of the year is typically around {{convert|10|°F|0}}.<ref>http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Images/300dpi/NM.jpg</ref> There are 2.8 days where the high is at or below freezing.

Spring is windy, sometimes unsettled with some rain, though spring is usually the driest part of the year in Albuquerque. March and April tend to see many days with the wind blowing at {{convert|20|to|30|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, and afternoon gusts can produce periods of blowing sand and dust. In May, the winds tend to subside.

The summer heat is relatively tolerable for most because of low humidity, except for some days during the [[monsoon]]. There are 2.7 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ highs annually, mostly in June and July and rarely in August due in part to the monsoon; an average 60 days see {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs.

Fall sees less rain than summer, though the weather can be more unsettled closer to winter.

Albuquerque averages around 9 inches of snow per winter, and experiences several accumulating snow events each season.  Locations in the Northeast Heights and Eastern Foothills tend to receive more snowfall due to each region's higher elevation and proximity to the mountains.  The city was one of several in the region experiencing a severe winter storm on December 28–30, 2006, with locations in Albuquerque receiving between {{convert|10.5|and|26|in|cm}} of snow.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/abq/climate/Monthlyreports/December/2006/PNS12312006.htm|title = Preliminary total snowfall reports across central and northern New Mexico from the December 28–30 winter storm|date = December 31, 2006|accessdate =August 5, 2009|publisher = National Weather Service Albuquerque, NM}}</ref>  More recently, a major winter storm in late February 2015 dropped up to a foot (30&nbsp;cm) of snow on most of the city.

The mountains and highlands beyond the city create a [[rain shadow]] effect, due to the drying of air ascending the mountains; the city usually receives very little rain or snow, averaging 8–9&nbsp;inches (216&nbsp;mm) of precipitation per year. Valley and west mesa areas, farther from the mountains are drier, averaging 6–8&nbsp;inches of annual precipitation; the Sandia foothills tend to lift any available moisture, enhancing precipitation to about 10–17&nbsp;inches annually.

Traveling to the west, north and east of Albuquerque, one quickly rises in elevation and leaves the sheltering effect of the valley to enter a noticeably cooler and slightly wetter environment. One such area is still considered part of metro Albuquerque, commonly called the "East Mountain" area; it is covered in savannas or woodlands of low juniper and piñon trees, reminiscent of the lower parts of the southern Rocky Mountains, which do not actually contact Albuquerque proper. Most rain occurs during the summer monsoon season (also called a [[chubasco]] in Mexico), typically starting in early July and ending in mid-September.

===Hydrology===

Albuquerque's [[drinking water]] presently comes from a combination of Rio Grande water (river water diverted from the [[Colorado River]] basin through the [[San Juan-Chama Project]]<ref>Your Drinking Water http://www.abcwua.org/Your_Drinking_Water.aspx Accessed August 1, 2013 Albuquerque Bernalillo Water Authority</ref>) and a delicate [[aquifer]] that was once described as an "underground [[Lake Superior]]". The [[Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority]] (ABCWUA) has developed a water resources management strategy, which pursues [[water conservation|conservation]] and the direct extraction of water from the Rio Grande for the development of a stable underground aquifer in the future.<ref>{{Cite journal|last= Odenwald |first= Arlene Cinelli |date=April 1993 |title=Protecting the aquifer: Albuquerque reacting |journal=New Mexico Business Journal |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=38–39 |issn=0164-6796 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5092/is_n4_v17/ai_13856429 |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |quote= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226072943/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m5092/is_n4_v17/ai_13856429| archivedate= December 26, 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="water strategy">

[[File:Tingley Beach Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Tingley Beach in Old Town, Albuquerque, a pond in a former watercourse by the Rio Grande]]

The aquifer of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco]] is too [[brackish water|saline]] to be cost-effectively used for drinking purposes. Much of the [[rainwater]] that Albuquerque receives does not recharge its aquifer. It is diverted through a network of paved channels and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]s, and emptied into the [[Rio Grande]].

Of the {{convert|62780|acre.ft}} per year of the water in the upper [[Colorado River]] basin entitled to municipalities in New Mexico by the [[Colorado River Compact|Upper Colorado River Basin Compact]], Albuquerque owns 48,200. The water is delivered to the Rio Grande by the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan]]–[[Rio Chama (Rio Grande)|Chama]] Project. The project's construction was initiated by legislation enacted by President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1962, and completed in 1971. This diversion project transports water under the [[continental divide]] from [[Navajo Lake]] to Lake Heron on the Rio Chama, a tributary of the Rio Grande. In the past much of this water was resold to downstream owners in Texas. These arrangements ended in 2008 with the completion of the ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project.<ref>The project's page at the United States Bureau of Reclamation's website [http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Project.jsp?proj_Name=San%20Juan-Chama%20Project]</ref>

The ABCWUA's Drinking Water Supply Project uses a system of adjustable height dams to skim water from the Rio Grande into [[sluice]]s which lead to [[water treatment]] facilities for direct [[Water purification|conversion to potable water]]. Some water is allowed to flow through central Albuquerque, mostly to protect the endangered [[Rio Grande Silvery Minnow]]. [[Sewage treatment|Treated]] effluent water is recycled into the Rio Grande to the south of the city. The ABCWUA expects river water to comprise up to seventy percent of its water budget in 2060.  [[Groundwater]] will constitute the remainder. One of the policies of the ABCWUA's strategy is the acquisition of additional river water.<ref name="water strategy" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abcwua.org/content/view/34/27/ |title=The Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority |publisher=Abcwua.org |date=December 7, 2008 |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref> {{Rp|Policy G, 14}}

===Quadrants===
Albuquerque is geographically divided into four [[Address (geography)#Quadrants|quadrants]] which are officially part of the mailing address. They are '''NE''' (northeast), '''NW''' (northwest), '''SE''' (southeast), and '''SW''' (southwest). The north-south dividing line is Central Avenue (the path that [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] took through the city) and the east-west dividing line is the [[BNSF Railway]] tracks.

====Northeast Quadrant====

This quadrant has been experiencing a housing expansion since the late 1950s. It abuts the base of the Sandia Mountains and contains portions of the foothills neighborhoods, which are significantly higher, in elevation and price range, than the rest of the city. Running from Central Avenue and the railroad tracks to the [[Sandia Peak Tramway|Sandia Peak Aerial Tram]], this is the largest quadrant both geographically and by population. The [[University of New Mexico]], the [[Maxwell Museum of Anthropology]], Nob Hill, the Uptown area which includes two shopping malls ([[Coronado Center]] and ABQ Uptown), Hoffmantown, Journal Center, and Balloon Fiesta Park are all located in this quadrant.

Some of the most affluent neighborhoods in the city are located here, including: [[High Desert, Albuquerque, New Mexico|High Desert]], Tanoan, Sandia Heights, and North Albuquerque Acres. (Parts of Sandia Heights and North Albuquerque Acres are outside the city limits proper). A few houses in the farthest reach of this quadrant lie in the [[Cibola National Forest]], just over the line into [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]].

====Northwest Quadrant====
[[File:KiMo Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|KiMo Theatre in Downtown]]

This quadrant contains historic [[Old Town Albuquerque]], which dates back to the 18th century, as well as the [[Indian Pueblo Cultural Center]]. The area has a mixture of commercial districts and low- to middle-income neighborhoods. Northwest Albuquerque includes the largest section of [[Downtown Albuquerque|downtown]], [[Rio Grande Nature Center State Park]] and the [[Bosque]] ("woodlands"), [[Petroglyph National Monument]], [[Double Eagle II Airport]], Martineztown, the Paradise Hills neighborhood, Taylor Ranch, and [[Cottonwood Mall (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cottonwood Mall]].

Additionally, the "North Valley" area, which has some expensive homes and small ranches along the [[Rio Grande]], is located here. The city of Albuquerque engulfs the village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]] and borders [[Corrales, New Mexico|Corrales]] in the North Valley. A small portion of the rapidly developing area on the west side of the river south of the Petroglyphs, known as the "[[West Mesa]]" or "Westside", consisting primarily of traditional residential subdivisions, also extends into this quadrant. The city proper is bordered on the north by the city of [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]].

====Southeast Quadrant====
[[File:Lobo Theater, Albuquerque NM.jpg|thumb|Lobo Theater in Nob Hill]]

[[Kirtland Air Force Base]], [[Sandia National Laboratories]], Sandia Science & Technology Park, [[Albuquerque International Sunport]], [[Eclipse Aerospace]], [[American Society of Radiologic Technologists]], [[Central New Mexico Community College]], Albuquerque Veloport, [[University Stadium, Albuquerque|University Stadium]], [[Isotopes Park]], [[The Pit (arena)|The Pit]], [[Mesa del Sol]], [[The Pavilion (amphitheatre)|The Pavilion]], Albuquerque Studios, Isleta Resort & Casino, [[National Museum of Nuclear Science & History]], New Mexico Veterans' Memorial, and Talin Market are all located in the Southeast (SE) quadrant.

The upscale neighborhood of Four Hills is located in the foothills of Southeast Albuquerque. Other neighborhoods include [[Nob Hill, Albuquerque|Nob Hill]], Ridgecrest, Willow Wood, and Volterra.

====Southwest Quadrant====
Traditionally consisting of agricultural and rural areas and suburban neighborhoods, the Southwest quadrant contains the community of [[South Valley, New Mexico]], often referred to as "The South Valley". Although the city limits of Albuquerque do not include the South Valley, it extends all the way to the Isleta Indian Reservation. Newer suburban subdivisions on the [[West Mesa]] near the southwestern city limits join homes of older construction, some dating back as far as the 1940s. This quadrant includes the old communities of Atrisco, Los Padillas, Kinney, Westgate, Westside, Alamosa, Mountainview, and Pajarito. The south end of downtown Albuquerque, the [[Bosque]] ("woodlands"), the [[Barelas]] neighborhood, the [[National Hispanic Cultural Center]], and the [[Albuquerque Biological Park]] are also located here.

A proposed development, Santolina, would extend development further west past 118th Street SW to the edge of the [[Rio Puerco (Rio Grande)|Rio Puerco Valley]], and house 100,000 by 2050. It is unclear at this time whether the Santolina development will be annexed into the City of Albuquerque or incorporated into its own city when its development does occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bernco.gov/Santolina/|title=Proposed Santolina Level A Master Plan-Bernalillo County, New Mexico|work=bernco.gov}}</ref>

[[John Gaw Meem]], credited with developing and popularizing the [[Pueblo Revival]] style, was based in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] but received an important Albuquerque commission in 1933 as the architect of the [[University of New Mexico]]. He retained this commission for the next quarter-century and developed the University's distinctive Southwest style.<ref name="Simmons" /> {{Rp|317}}  Meem also designed the [[Cathedral Church of St. John (Albuquerque, New Mexico)|Cathedral Church of St. John]] in 1950.<ref name=diocese>{{cite web|url=http://www.dioceserg.org/pages/view/history_of_the_diocese|title=History of the Diocese|publisher=Diocese of the Rio Grande|accessdate=January 3, 2014|last=|first=}}</ref>

Albuquerque boasts a unique nighttime cityscape. Many building exteriors are illuminated in vibrant colors such as green and blue. The Wells Fargo Building is illuminated green. The DoubleTree Hotel and the Compass Bank building are illuminated blue. The [[rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] of the county courthouse is illuminated yellow, while the tops of the Bank of Albuquerque and the Bank of the West are illuminated reddish-yellow. Due to the nature of the soil in the Rio Grande Valley, the skyline is lower than might be expected in a city of comparable size elsewhere.

Albuquerque has expanded greatly in area since the mid-1940s. During those years of expansion, the planning of the newer areas has considered that people drive rather than walk. The pre-1940s parts of Albuquerque are quite different in style and scale from the post 1940s areas. These older areas include the North Valley, the South Valley, various neighborhoods near downtown, and Corrales. The newer areas generally feature four to six lane roads in a <span style="white-space:nowrap">1&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(1.61&nbsp;km)</span> grid. Each <span style="white-space:nowrap">1&nbsp;square mile&nbsp;(2.59&nbsp;km²)</span> is divided into four {{convert|160|acre|km2|sing=on}} neighborhoods by smaller roads set <span style="white-space:nowrap">0.5&nbsp;miles&nbsp;(0.8&nbsp;km)</span> between major roads. When driving along major roads in the newer sections of Albuquerque, one sees strip malls, signs, and cinderblock walls. The upside of this planning style is that neighborhoods are shielded from the worst of the noise and lights on the major roads. The downside is that it is virtually impossible to go anywhere from home without driving.

The judicial system in Albuquerque includes the [[Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court]].

===Police Department===

The [[Albuquerque Police Department]] (APD) is the [[police]] department with jurisdiction within the city limits, with anything outside of the city limits being considered the unincorporated area of [[Bernalillo County, New Mexico|Bernalillo County]] and policed by the [[Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department]]. It is the largest municipal police department in [[New Mexico]], and in September 2008 the US Department of Justice recorded the APD as the 49th largest police department in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies|year=2008|author=[[United States Department of Justice]]|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/csllea08.pdf|accessdate=March 31, 2014}}</ref>

In November 2012, the [[United States Department of Justice]] launched an investigation into APD’s policies and practices to determine whether APD engages in a pattern or practice of use of excessive force in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141 (“Section 14141”).<ref>{{cite web|title=United States V. City Of Albuquerque|url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/apd_settlement_10-31-14.pdf|website=U.S. Department Of Justice|publisher=U.S. Department Of Justice|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref>		 	 	 
As part of its investigation, the Department of Justice consulted with police practices experts and conducted a comprehensive assessment of officers’ use of force and APD policies and operations. The investigation included tours of APD facilities and Area Commands; interviews with Albuquerque officials, APD command staff, supervisors, and police officers; a review of numerous documents; and meetings with the Albuquerque Police Officers Association, residents, community groups, and other stakeholders.<ref>{{cite web|title=United States V. City Of Albuquerque|url=http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/apd_settlement_10-31-14.pdf|website=U.S. Department Of Justice|publisher=U.S. Department Of Justice|accessdate=4 May 2015}}</ref>
When the Department of Justice concluded its investigation, it issued a scathing report that uncovered a "culture of acceptance of the use of excessive force" involving significant harm or injury by APD officers against people who posed no threat and which was not justified by the circumstances. The DOJ recommended a nearly complete overhaul of the department's use-of-force policies. Among several systematic problems at APD were an aggressive culture that undervalued civilian safety and discounted the importance of crisis intervention.<ref>Mike Gallagher, "[http://www.abqjournal.com/382534/news/feds-seek-consent-decree-on-reforms.html Scathing Report on APD Use of Force]," ''Albuquerque Journal'', April 11, 2014.

Albuquerque lies at the center of the New Mexico Technology Corridor, a concentration of high-tech private companies and government institutions along the Rio Grande. Larger institutions whose employees contribute to the population are numerous and include [[Sandia National Laboratories]], [[Kirtland Air Force Base]], and the attendant contracting companies which bring highly educated workers to a somewhat isolated region. [[Intel]] operates a large semiconductor factory or "[[Fab (semiconductors)|fab]]" in suburban [[Rio Rancho, New Mexico|Rio Rancho]], in neighboring [[Sandoval County, New Mexico|Sandoval County]], with its attendant large capital investment.  [[Northrop Grumman]] is located along I-25 in northeast Albuquerque, and [[Tempur-Pedic]] is located on the West Mesa next to I-40.

The [[solar power|solar energy]] and architectural-design innovator [[Steve Baer]] located his company, Zomeworks, to the region in the late 1960s; and [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Sandia National Laboratories|Sandia]], and [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] cooperate here in an enterprise that began with the [[Manhattan Project]]. In January 2007, Tempur-Pedic opened an {{convert|800000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} mattress factory in northwest Albuquerque. SCHOTT Solar, Inc., announced in January 2008 they will open a {{convert|200000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility manufacturing receivers for concentrated solar thermal power plants (CSP) and 64MW of photovoltaic (PV) modules. The facility closed in 2012.

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Big-I abq.jpg|thumb|Interchange between [[I-40]] and [[I-25]], known as [[Big I]] {{Deletable image-caption|date=March 2012}}]] -->

Some of the main highways in the metro area include:

* [[Interstate 25 in New Mexico|Pan-American Freeway]]:<ref name="Bryan">{{Cite book|last=Bryan|first=Howard|title=Albuquerque Remembered|publisher=[[University of New Mexico Press]]|location=Albuquerque|year=1989|isbn=0-8263-3782-1|oclc=62109913|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rSQAbMtClsYC&lpg=PA248&dq=%22Pan%20American%20Freeway%22%20%22Coronado%20Freeway%22&pg=PA248#v=onepage&q=%22Pan%20American%20Freeway%22%20%22Coronado%20Freeway%22|accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref>{{Rp|248}} More commonly known as [[Interstate 25]] or "I-25", it is the main north–south highway on the city's eastern side of the [[Rio Grande]]. It is also the main north–south highway in the state (by connecting Albuquerque with [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]) and a plausible route of the eponymous [[Pan American Highway]]. Since [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]] was decommissioned in the 1980s, the only remaining US highway in Albuquerque, unsigned [[US-85]], shares its alignment with I-25.  [[US-550]] splits off to the northwest from I-25/US-85 in [[Bernalillo, New Mexico|Bernalillo]].[[File:Albuquerque - aerial - I-40 east from Juan Tabo Blvd NE.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Interstate 40]]]]
* [[Interstate 40 in New Mexico|Coronado Freeway]]:<ref name="Bryan" />{{Rp|248}} More commonly known as [[Interstate 40]] or "I-40", it is the city's main east–west traffic artery and an important transcontinental route. The freeway's name in the city is in reference to 16th century [[conquistador]] and explorer [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado]].
* [[Paseo del Norte]]: (aka; State Highway 423):  This 6-lane highway is approximately five miles north of Interstate-40. It runs from Tramway Blvd (at the base of the Sandia Mountains) to Interstate 25, through Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, over the Rio Grande River to North Coors Boulevard. Paseo Del Norte then continues west through the Petroglyph National Monument until it reaches Atrisco Vista Blvd and the Double Eagle II Airport. (the extension of this highway through this National Park from Golf Course Rd., through to Unser Blvd., was finally approved and opened in 2007). (Note: Interstate-25 and Paseo del Norte intersection under construction beginning in 2013, completed 2014).
* [[Coors Boulevard]]: Coors is the main north-south artery to the west of the Rio Grande River in Albuquerque. There is one full [[interchange (road)#Complete interchanges|interchange]] where it connects with Interstate 40. The rest of the route has [[stoplight]]s, [[sidewalk]]s and [[bike lane]]s. To the north of Interstate 40, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 448|State Highway 448]], while to the south, part of the route is numbered as [[New Mexico State Road 45|State Highway 45]].
* [[Central Avenue (Albuquerque)|Central Avenue]]: Central is one of the historical routings of [[US Highway 66|Route 66]], it is no longer a main through highway, its usefulness having been supplanted by Interstate 40.<ref name="Bryan" />{{Rp|248}}
* [[Alameda Boulevard (Albuquerque)|Alameda Boulevard]]: The main road to Rio Rancho, Alameda Blvd. stretches from Tramway Rd. to Coors. Blvd. Like Paseo del Norte, Alameda Blvd. is a freeway, that stretches from Corrales Rd. to Jefferson St.

Tramway Boulevard starts at I-25 near Sandia Pueblo, and heads east as a two-lane road. It turns south near the base of the [[Sandia Peak Tramway]] and becomes a [[divided highway]] until its terminus near I-40 and Central Avenue by the western entrance to [[Tijeras Canyon]].

The [[interchange (road)|interchange]] between I-40 and I-25 is known as the "[[Big I]]".<ref name="Bryan" />{{Rp|248}} Originally built in 1966, it was rebuilt in 2002.  The Big I is the only 5 level stack interchange in the state of New Mexico.

There are other major roads in Albuquerque too. These include San Mateo, Osuna, San Antonio, Academy, Carlisle, Lead, Coal, Rio Bravo, University, Lomas, Broadway/Edith, Montgomery/Montaño, Comanche, Rio Grande, Unser, 98th Street, Eubank, Juan Tabo, Louisiana, Wyoming, San Pedro, Gibson, Jefferson, Candelaria, and Menaul.

The eastern approaches of the northernmost three all pass through adjacent unincorporated areas, the Village of [[Los Ranchos de Albuquerque, New Mexico|Los Ranchos de Albuquerque]], or the [[North Valley, New Mexico|North Valley]]. In downstream order they are:
* '''Alameda Bridge'''
* '''Paseo del Norte Bridge'''

====Rail====
[[File:Downtown Albuquerque stn look south.JPG|thumb|Rail Runner Express Downtown Albuquerque station train platform]]
The state owns most of the city's rail infrastructure which is used by a commuter rail system, long distance passenger trains, and the freight trains of the [[BNSF Railway]].

====Freight Service====
[[BNSF Railway]] operates a small yard operation out of Abajo yard, located just south of the Cesar E. Chavez Ave. overpass and the [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]] yards. Most freight traffic through the Central New Mexico region is processed via a much larger hub in nearby [[Belen, New Mexico]].

====Intercity rail====
[[Amtrak]]'s [[Southwest Chief]], which travels between Chicago and Los Angeles, serves the Albuquerque area daily with one stop in each direction at the [[Alvarado Transportation Center]] in downtown.

====Commuter rail====
The [[New Mexico Rail Runner Express]], a [[commuter rail]] line, began service between [[Sandoval County]] and Albuquerque in July 2006 using an existing [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]] right-of-way which was purchased by New Mexico in 2005. Service expanded to [[Valencia County]] in December 2006 and to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on December 17, 2008. Rail Runner now connects [[Santa Fe County|Santa Fe]], Sandoval, [[Bernalillo County|Bernalillo]], and Valencia Counties with thirteen station stops, including three stops within Albuquerque.<ref>

The section of the line running south to [[Belen, New Mexico|Belen]] is served less frequently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmrailrunner.com/PDF/Weekday%20Schedule%20SF%2012-08.pdf |format=PDF |title=New Mexico Rail Runner Express Monday–Friday Schedule |accessdate=December 23, 2008 |publisher=New Mexico Rail Runner Express |date=December 2, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090114191537/http://www.nmrailrunner.com/PDF/Weekday%20Schedule%20SF%2012-08.pdf| archivedate= January 14, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

====Local mass transit==== <!-- Albuquerque Traction Company, and City Electric Company redirect here -->
[[File:Albuquerque Alvarado Transportation Hub.jpg|thumb|New intermodal transportation hub in downtown Albuquerque]]

Albuquerque was one of two cities in New Mexico to have had electric street railways. Albuquerque's horse-drawn streetcar lines were electrified during the first few years of the 20th century. The '''Albuquerque Traction Company''' assumed operation of the system in 1905. The system grew to its maximum length of {{convert|6|mi|km}} during the next ten years by connecting destinations such as [[Old Town Albuquerque|Old Town]] to the west and the [[University of New Mexico]] to the east with the town's urban center near the former [[Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway]] depot. The Albuquerque Traction Company failed financially in 1915 and the vaguely named '''City Electric Company''' was formed. Despite traffic booms during the first world war, and unaided by lawsuits attempting to force the streetcar company to pay for paving, that system also failed later in 1927, leaving the [[streetcar]]'s "motorettes" unemployed.<ref name="Myrick">{{Cite book|last=Myrick|first=David F|title=New Mexico's Railroads --- An Historical Survey|publisher=Colorado Railroad Museum|location=Golden, Colorado|year=1970|id= Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 70-116915}}</ref>{{Rp|177–181}}

Today, Alvarado Station provides convenient access to other parts of the city via the city bus system, [[ABQ RIDE]]. ABQ RIDE operates a variety of bus routes, including the [[Rapid Ride]] express bus service.

In 2006 the City of Albuquerque under the mayorship of [[Martin Chavez]] had planned and attempted to "fast track" the development of a "Modern Streetcar" project. Funding for the US$270 million system was not resolved as many citizens vocally opposed the project. The city and [[ABQ RIDE|its transit department]] maintain a policy commitment to the [[streetcar]] project.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.abqtrib.com/news/2006/dec/04/council-streetcar-project-rushed/|title=Council: Streetcar project rushed|last=Gisick|first=Michael|date=December 4, 2006|publisher=Albuquerque Tribune|accessdate=April 26, 2009}}</ref> The project would run mostly in the southeast quadrant on Central Avenue and Yale Boulevard.

{{as of|2011}}, the city is working on a study to develop a [[Albuquerque Rapid Transit|bus rapid transit]] system through the Central Ave. corridor.  This corridor carried 44% of all bus riders in the ABQ Ride system, making it a natural starting point for enhanced service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cabq.gov/transit/planning-for-the-future-bus-rapid-transit-brt-service-on-central-avenue|title=Planning for the Future: Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Service on Central Avenue|publisher=CABQ.gov|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}</ref>
