==Early life==

With friend [[Sir Jinx]], Ice Cube formed the [[C.I.A. (group)|C.I.A.]], and they performed at parties hosted by [[Dr. Dre]]. Dre soon entered the recording industry as a member of the [[World Class Wreckin' Cru]]. Dre saw Cube's potential as a writer and had him assist with writing Wreckin Cru's big L.A. hit track, "Cabbage Patch" as well as joining Cube on a side partnership which the duo called Stereo Crew. Stereo Crew produced a twelve-inch record, "She's a Skag" released on [[Epic Records]] in 1986.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Johson|first=Bill|title=Ice Cube Reminisces On His Very First Gig And Single|url=http://theurbandaily.com/music/first-things-first-music/billjohnson/ice-cube-reminisces-on-his-very-first-gig-and-single/|work=The Urban Daily |date=May 31, 2010|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}</ref>

While Dr. Dre was DJing at L.A. dance club Eve After Dark, Ice Cube would rap over his music, often parodying songs by other artists. One such example of this was the song "My Penis," a parody of Run-DMC's "My Adidas."<ref>{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Jake |date=2006 |title=Dr. Dre in the Studio: From Compton, Death Row, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, the Game, and Mad Money : the Life, Times, and Aftermath of the Notorious Record Producer, Dr. Dre |location=London |publisher=Amber Books Publishing |page=6 |isbn=9780976773559}}</ref>  In a 2015 interview, club-owner [[Alonzo Williams]] said that he felt that this song damaged his reputation and asked for it not to be performed.<ref name="Lonzo">[http://allhiphop.com/2015/08/24/world-class-wreckin-crus-lonzo-williams-dr-dre-gay-rumors-straight-outta-compton/ World Class Wreckin’ Cru Founder Alonzo Williams Addresses Dr. Dre Gay Rumors & ‘Straight Outta Compton’], 24 August 2015</ref>

==Music career==

===N.W.A: 1986&ndash;1989===
{{Main|N.W.A}}
In 1987, Ice Cube released the [[Dr. Dre]] produced single ''[[My Posse]]'' under with his group [[CIA (group)|C.I.A.]] (Cru' In Action!). After the collaboration, Ice Cube showed [[Eazy-E]] the lyrics to "[[Boyz-n-the-Hood]]".<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Ice Cube – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p48/biography|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2007|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref> Eazy-E, although initially rejecting the lyrics, eventually recorded the song for ''[[N.W.A. and the Posse]]'', the debut album for the group [[N.W.A]] that also included [[Dr. Dre]], [[MC Ren]], and [[DJ Yella]]. Ice Cube was the only member of N.W.A who is not from [[Compton, California]] (where it was formed).

By this point Ice Cube was a full-time member of N.W.A along with [[Dr. Dre]] and [[MC Ren]]. Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre's and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.<ref>''Ice Cube: Attitude'' (McIver, 2002) ISBN 1-86074-428-1</ref>

Ice Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<ref name="Attitude70">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref>  This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<ref name="Attitude70"/> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on their next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.

===Solo career: 1989&ndash;present===
In 1989, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed the female rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name="Allmusic"/>

His second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' ("a vision of where we are today") and the 'Life Side' ("a vision of where we need to go"). It features "[[No Vaseline]]", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as "Black Korea," a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name="Allmusic"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name="Guardian">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>

[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]
Ice Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, "[[Wicked (song)|Wicked]]", he rapped "April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included "[[It Was a Good Day]]" and "[[Check Yo Self]]", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including "[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]", "[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]", "[[You Know How We Do It]]" & "What Can I Do?". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Kausion]], and [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name="Allmusic"/>

In 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]], who was now part of [[Death Row Records]], in their duet "Natural Born Killaz".<ref name="Allmusic"/> In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, ''[[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)]]''. The delayed sixth album ''[[War & Peace - Volume 2 (The Peace Disc)|Volume 2]]'', was released in 2000. The albums featured appearances from [[Westside Connection]] as well as a reunion with fellow N.W.A members, Dr. Dre and MC Ren, though many fans maintained that the two albums were not on par with his past work, especially the second volume.<ref>{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title="War & Peace, Vol. 2 (The Peace Disc)" – Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r465652|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref> In 2000, Ice Cube also joined Dr. Dre, [[Eminem]] & [[Snoop Dogg]] for the [[Up in Smoke Tour]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|title=Four Hours of Swagger from Dr. Dre and Friends|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C07E2DE123BF934A25754C0A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times |date=July 17, 2000|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref>

In 2006, Ice Cube released his seventh solo album, ''[[Laugh Now, Cry Later]]'', on his [[Lench Mob Records]] label, debuting at number four on the [[Billboard Charts]] and selling 144,000 units in the first week.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ice Cube – Billboard Albums|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p48/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2007|accessdate=February 13, 2008}}</ref> The album featured production from [[Lil Jon]] and [[Scott Storch]], who produced the lead single "[[Why We Thugs]]". He released his eighth studio album, [[Raw Footage]], on August 19, 2008, featuring the controversial single "[[Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It]]".

On October 12, 2009, he released a non-album track called 'Raider Nation' in tribute to the Oakland Raiders.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://icecube.com/news/5743/ |title=Raider Nation! |publisher=Ice Cube |date= |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref>

On May 11, 2010, Ice Cube released a [[30 for 30]] documentary, "Straight Outta L.A.", for [[ESPN]] on the relationship between the gangsta rap scene in Los Angeles and the tenure of the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsradiointerviews.com/2009/11/12/ice-cube-%e2%80%9craiders-fans-were-gangster%e2%80%99s-way-before-we-came-into-the-picture%e2%80%9d/ |title=Blog Archive » Ice Cube: "Raiders fans were gangster's way before we came into the picture" |publisher=Sports Radio Interviews |date=November 12, 2009 |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://30for30.espn.com/film/straight-outta-la.html |title=ESPN 30 for 30 |publisher=ESPN  |date=June 17, 1994 |accessdate=June 1, 2010}}</ref> He has been voted as eighth of MTV's "greatest emcees of all time."<ref name="eighth">[http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index4.jhtml "Ice Cube: Rank 8"], MTV.com. Accessed February 4, 2011.</ref>

On September 28, 2010, Cube released his ninth solo album, ''[[I Am the West]]''. The album featured the single "I Rep That West". It debuted at #22 on the Billboard 200 and sold 22,000 copies in its first week.

===Westside Connection: 1996&ndash;2007===
In 1996, Ice Cube formed [[Westside Connection]] with [[Mack 10]] and [[WC (rapper)|WC]], and together they released an album called ''[[Bow Down]]''. Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast&ndash;West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like "Bow Down" and "Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.

After a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. "Gangsta Nation" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.

===Collaborations: 1992–present===
In 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funkee Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.

In 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track "Last Wordz" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: "[[Natural Born Killaz]]", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song "Two To The Head" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album "Live And Let Die". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's "[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]". Ice Cube appeared on the song "[[Children of the Korn]]" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track "Get Em Up". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like "Keep it 100", "80's babies" and "Jack and the bean stalk". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z.]] in the song "Iz You Ready to die" and in [[DJ Quik]] in the song "Boogie Till You Conk Out" in 2011.

In 2014 Ice Cube appeared on [[MC Ren]]'s remix for [[Rebel Music (song)|Rebel Music]]. This was the first time the duo had worked together since the N.W.A reunion in 2000.<ref>Tardio, Andres.

In 2004, he appeared in the [[Lil Jon & the East Side Boyz]] song, "[[Real Nigga Roll Call]]".
In late 2005, Ice Cube and [[R. J. Cutler]] teamed up to create the six-part documentary series titled ''[[Black. White.]]'', which was broadcast on cable network [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]. In May 2006 Ice Cube complained that [[Oprah Winfrey]] would not welcome him and other rappers on her show.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Ice Cube: Oprah has 'a problem with hip-hop'|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12991185/|publisher=MSNBC|agency=Associated Press|date=May 26, 2006|accessdate=May 18, 2008}}</ref> Ice Cube's other movie projects include ''Teacher of the Year'', released in 2007,<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/celebs/celeb.aspx?c=59868 |title=Ice Cube - Overview - MSN Movies |publisher=Movies.msn.com |date=1969-06-15 |accessdate=2012-12-12}}</ref> and ''The Extractors'', released in 2008.

He has signed on to star in and produce ''[[Welcome Back, Kotter]]'', a big-screen adaptation of the 1970s television series.<ref>[http://www.pr-inside.com/ice-cube-cautious-about-welcoming-back-kotter-r7477.htm Ice Cube cautious about welcoming back Kotter], Pr-inside.com; accessed October 8, 2010.</ref> Ice Cube will play the title character, originally portrayed by [[Gabe Kaplan]] and his film company, Cube Vision Productions, has sealed a deal with [[Dimension Films]] to bring the show to the big screen.

In October 2006, [[Xzibit]], [[Lil Jon]] and WC from the Westside Connection honored Ice Cube at VH1's Annual Hip Hop Honors, performing some classic Ice Cube tracks, and Ice Cube also performed "Why We Thugs" and "Go To Church" from his album ''Laugh Now, Cry Later'', where the New York crowd were greeted with Cube's vintage Cali sound. After launching that comeback album, Ice Cube toured across the world to promote it. The tour is known as "Straight Outta Compton Tour", and accompanying him is his friend and fellow rapper WC from the Westside Connection. Some places he has recently performed include the Paradiso in [[Amsterdam]] and various venues in England. After touring the U.S. and Europe, he performed all around Australia, from Sydney's [[Enmore Theatre]] to The Forum Arena in Melbourne, before heading to Japan.

Ice Cube collaborated with [[Tech N9ne]] on the song "Blackboy" that appears on Tech N9ne's July 2008 album ''[[Killer (Tech N9ne album)|Killer]]''. The eighth Ice Cube studio LP, titled ''[[Raw Footage]]'', was released on August 19, 2008, and featured the singles [[Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It]] and [[Do Ya Thang (Ice Cube song)|Do Ya Thang]]. Ice Cube appeared on a song by rapper [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]] titled "State of Emergency" off The Game's Album, [[LAX (album)|L.A.X.]] In 2009, Ice Cube performed at the [[Gathering of the Juggalos]], and will return to perform at the 2011 festival.<ref>{{youtube|5gKE67L97SA|2011 Gathering Of The Juggalos Infomercial}}</ref>

Despite rumors of conflicts with other rappers in 2010, Ice Cube stated in an interview with [[DJ Whoo Kid]] on Sirius Shade 45 that he has "no beef."<ref>{{cite web|author=[[DJ Whoo Kid]]|url=http://www.radioplanet.tv/ice-cube-shade-45-interview|title=Ice Cube New Friday?! Beef With Who?! Mike Epps On-Set Smoke Out?! Lottery Ticket Fun! VIDEO!|work=RadioPlanet.tv|date=August 22, 2010}}</ref>

Ice Cube's ninth studio album ''[[I Am the West]]'' was released on September 28, 2010. Ice Cube has stated this album has a different direction than any one of his other albums. He received beats from West coast veteran producers such as [[DJ Quik]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[E-A-Ski]], and [[Sir Jinx]], not having worked on a solo album with the latter in nearly 20 years. The album was released independently under his label [[Lench Mob Records|Lench Mob]]. Ice Cube has stated that "being independent is beautiful because we can do things 'out the box' He also signed a upcoming recording artist named 7Tre The Ghost, that record companies would usually frown at. Instead of working from a ready-made cookie-cutter marketing plan, we can tailor make a marketing plan specifically for me."

In November 2011, Ice Cube stated via Twitter that he was seven songs into the current album he's recording. He also stated he "always got an album coming out" which suggests that he isn't thinking of rap retirement to focus on acting in the near future.

A music video for the album's first single of the same name was released on the day before the 2012 USA Election. Ice Cube explained the inspiration and reason for the song saying, "You know, this record is for the political heads. This to me is more a leak at the right time, in time, to drop it. We could have dropped a more catchier tune, but the time wouldn't have been right. The time is right for "Everythang's Corrupt," so that's what we wanted to do. We wanted to drop it at this point and time, and then come with a visual to highlight what we're saying in the music."<ref>{{cite web|last=Ortiz |first=Edwin |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.21729/title.ice-cube-details-new-song-everythangs-corrupt-album-praises-kendrick-lamar |title=Ice Cube Details New Song "Everythang's Corrupt" & Album, Praises Kendrick Lamar &#124; Get The Latest Hip Hop News, Rap News & Hip Hop Album Sales |publisher=HipHop DX |date=2012-11-01 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> ''Everythang's Corrupt'' was released on iTunes in January 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/everythangs-corrupt-single/id587675433 |title=iTunes - Music - Everythang's Corrupt - Single by Ice Cube |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2013-01-04 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> The second single "Crowded" was released to iTunes on March 29.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/crowded-single/id626624693 |title=iTunes - Music - Crowded - Single by Ice Cube |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2013-03-29 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> Ice Cube confirmed on his Twitter account that the album will be released in the fall of 2013 and will also be released via Lench Mob Records.<ref>{{cite web|title=Twitter / icecube|url=https://twitter.com/icecube/status/325003749187792897|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> However, the album would be pushed back once again with no release date currently set.
