'''Hanja''' is the [[Korean language|Korean]] name for [[Chinese characters]] ({{zh|t=漢字|p=hànzì}}).<ref>{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The writing systems of the world|year=1991|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-18028-9|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOywmavmZ3UC}}</ref>  More specifically, it refers to those Chinese characters borrowed from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and incorporated into the [[Korean language]] with Korean [[pronunciation]]. ''Hanja-mal'' or ''[[Sino-Korean vocabulary|hanja-eo]]'' refers to words that can be written with hanja, and ''hanmun'' ({{lang|ko|한문}}, {{lang|ko|漢文}}) refers to [[Classical Chinese]] writing, although "hanja" is sometimes used loosely to encompass these other concepts. Because hanja never underwent major reform, they are almost entirely identical to [[traditional Chinese]] and ''[[kyūjitai]]'' characters. Only a small number of hanja characters are modified or unique to Korean. By contrast, many of the Chinese characters currently in use in Japan and Mainland China have been simplified, and contain fewer strokes than the corresponding hanja characters.{{citation needed lead|date=May 2016}}<!-- The template in the lead of our article "Tripiṭaka" currently includes a random Buddhist term that looks the same in Japanese and Korean but in Chinese is more complicated. I would like to see a source that specifies that this is an exception, rather than the rule. ~Hijiri88, May 2016. -->

Although a phonetic Korean alphabet, now known as [[hangul]], had been created by a team of scholars commissioned in the 1440s by [[Sejong the Great|King Sejong the Great]], it did not come into widespread use until the late 19th and early 20th century.<ref name="fischer">{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Stephen Roger|title=A History of Writing|publisher=Reaktion Books|series=Globalities|pages=189–194|isbn=1-86189-101-6|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ywo0M9OpbXoC&pg=PA189|accessdate=2009-04-03|date=2004-04-04}}</ref>  Thus, until that time it was necessary to be fluent in reading and writing hanja in order to be literate in Korean, as the vast majority of Korean literature and most other Korean documents were written in hanja. Today, a good working knowledge of Chinese characters is still important for anyone who wishes to study older texts (up to about the 1990s), or anyone who wishes to read scholarly texts in the humanities. Learning a certain number of hanja is very helpful to understanding the [[etymology]] of Sino-Korean words, and to enlarging one's Korean vocabulary. Hanja are not used to write native Korean words, which are always rendered in hangul, and even words of Chinese origin—''hanja-eo'' ({{lang|ko|한자어, 漢字語}})—are written with the hangul alphabet most of the time.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==History==
A major motivation for the introduction of [[Chinese character]]s into [[Korea]] was the spread of [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhism]]. The major Chinese text that introduced hanja to Koreans, however, was not a religious text but the Chinese text, [[Thousand Character Classic|''Cheonjamun'']] (''Thousand Character Classic'').

Koreans had to learn [[Classical Chinese]] to be properly literate for the most part, but there were some systems developed to use simplified forms of Chinese characters that [[phonetic]]ally transcribe Korean, namely, [[hyangchal]] ({{lang|ko|향찰; 鄕札}}), [[gugyeol]] ({{lang|ko|구결; 口訣}}), and [[idu script|idu]] ({{lang|ko|이두; 吏讀}}).

One way of adapting hanja to write Korean in such systems (such as Gugyeol) was to represent native Korean [[grammatical particle]]s and other words solely according to their pronunciation. For example, Gugyeol uses the characters {{lang|ko|爲尼}} to transcribe the Korean word "hăni", in modern Korean, that means "does, and so". However, in Chinese, the same characters are read as the expression "wéi ní", meaning "becoming a nun." This is a typical example of Gugyeol words where the radical ({{lang|ko|爲}}) is read in Korean for its meaning (hă—"to do") and the suffix {{lang|ko|尼}}, ni (meaning "nun"), used phonetically.

Hanja was the sole means of writing Korean until [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|King Sejong the Great]] promoted the invention of [[hangul]] in the 15th century. However, even after the invention of hangul, most Korean scholars continued to write in hanmun.

It was not until the 20th century that hangul truly replaced hanja. Officially, hanja has not been used in [[North Korea]] since June 1949 (additionally, all texts are now written horizontally instead of vertically).{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Additionally, many words borrowed from Chinese have been replaced in the North with native Korean words. However, there are a large number of Chinese-borrowed words in widespread usage in the North (although written in hangul), and hanja still appear in special contexts, such as recent North Korean [[dictionaries]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2003/200305/news05/29.htm#6 |title = New Korean-English Dictionary published |date= 2003-05-28 |publisher= [[Korean Central News Agency]]}}</ref>{{OR|date=May 2016}}<!-- This is not a source that says "hanja still appear in special contexts, such as recent North Korean dictionaries"; it is a news article about a single North Korean dictionary that happens to include hanja. ~Hijiri88, May 2016. --> The replacement has been less total in South Korea where, although usage has declined over time, some hanja remains in common usage in some contexts.

==Character formation==
Each hanja is composed of one of 214 [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]]s plus in most cases one or more additional elements. The vast majority of hanja use the additional elements to indicate the sound of the character, but a few hanja are purely pictographic, and some were formed in other ways.

==''Eumhun''==
To aid in understanding the meaning of a character, or to describe it orally to distinguish it from other characters with the same pronunciation, character dictionaries and school textbooks refer to each character with a combination of its sound and a word indicating its meaning. This dual meaning-sound reading of a character is called ''eumhun'' ({{lang|ko|음훈; 音訓}}; from {{lang|ko|音}} "sound" + {{lang|ko|訓}} "meaning," "teaching").

The word or words used to denote the meaning are often&mdash;though hardly always&mdash;words of native Korean (i.e., non-Chinese) origin, and are sometimes archaic words no longer commonly used.

==Education==

===South===
South Korean primary schools abandoned the teaching of hanja in 1971. It is taught in separate courses in [[Education in South Korea|South Korean high schools]], separately from the normal Korean-language curriculum. Formal hanja education begins in grade 7 (junior high school) and continues until graduation from senior high school in grade 12. A total of 1,800 hanja are taught: 900 for junior high, and 900 for senior high (starting in grade 10).<ref>Hannas 1997: 71. "A balance was struck in August 1976, when the Ministry of Education agreed to keep Chinese characters out of the elementary schools and teach the 1,800 characters in special courses, not as part of Korean language or any other substantive curricula. This is where things stand at present"</ref> Post-secondary hanja education continues in some [[liberal-arts]] [[universities]].<ref>Hannas 1997: 68-69</ref> The 1972 promulgation of [[basic hanja for educational use|basic hanja for educational purposes]] changed on December 31, 2000 to replace 44 hanja with 44 others.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The choice of characters to eliminate and exclude caused heated debates prior to and after the 2000 promulgation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

Debate flared again in 2013 after a move by South Korean authorities to encourage primary and secondary schools to offer hanja classes. Officials said that learning Chinese characters could enhance students' Korean-language proficiency; protesters called the program "old-fashioned and unnecessary".<ref>
[http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20130703000818 "Hangeul advocates oppose Hanja classes"], ''The Korea Herald'', 2013-07-03.
</ref>

===North===
Though North Korea rapidly abandoned the general use of hanja soon after independence,<ref>Hannas 1997: 67. "By the end of 1946 and the beginning of 1947, the major newspaper ''Nodong sinmun'', mass circulation magazine ''Kulloja'', and similar publications began appearing in all-''hangul''. School textbooks and literary materials converted to all-''hangul'' at the same time or possibly earlier (So 1989:31)."</ref> the number of hanja taught in primary and secondary schools is actually greater than the 1,800 taught in South Korea.<ref>Hannas 1997: 68. "Although North Korea has removed Chinese characters from its written materials, it has, paradoxically, ended up with an educational program that teachers more characters than either South Korea or Japan, as Table 2 shows."</ref> [[Kim Il-sung]] had earlier called for a gradual elimination of the use of hanja,<ref>Hannas 1997: 67. "According to Ko Yong-kun, Kim went on record as early as February 1949, when Chinese characters had already been removed from most DPRK publications, as advocating their ''gradual'' abandonment (1989:25)."</ref> but by the 1960s, he had reversed his stance; he was quoted as saying in 1966, "While we should use as few Sinitic terms as possible, students must be exposed to the necessary Chinese characters and taught how to write them."<ref name="Hannas 1997: 67">Hannas 1997: 67</ref> As a result, a Chinese-character textbook was designed for North Korean schools for use in grades 5–9, teaching 1,500 characters, with another 500 for high school students.<ref>Hannas 1997: 67. "Between 1968 and 1969, a four-volume textbook appeared for use in grades 5 through 9 designed to teach 1,500 characters, confirming the applicability of the new policy to the general student population. Another five hundred were added for grades 10 through 12 (Yi Yun-p'yo 1989: 372)."</ref> College students are exposed to another 1,000, bringing the total to 3,000.<ref>Hannas 2003: 188-189</ref>

==Uses==
Because many different hanja—and thus, many different words written using hanja—often share the [[Homophone|same sounds]], two distinct hanja words (''hanjaeo'') may be spelled identically in the [[phonetic]] hangul [[alphabet]].  Thus, hanja are often used to clarify meaning, either on their own without the equivalent hangul spelling, or in parentheses after the hangul spelling as a kind of gloss.  Hanja are often also used as a form of shorthand in newspaper headlines, advertisements, and on signs, for example the banner at the funeral for the [[Republic of Korea Navy|sailors]] lost in the sinking of [[ROKS Cheonan (PCC-772)]].<ref name="Korea bids farewell">{{cite news

===Print media===
In South Korea, hanja are used most frequently in ancient literature, legal documents, and scholarly monographs, where they often appear without the equivalent hangul spelling.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  Usually, only those words with a specialized or ambiguous meaning are printed in hanja.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  In mass-circulation books and magazines, hanja are generally used rarely, and only to gloss words already spelled in hangul when the meaning is ambiguous.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Hanja are also often used in newspaper headlines as abbreviations or to eliminate ambiguity.<ref>Brown 1990: 120</ref> In formal publications, personal names are also usually glossed in hanja in parentheses next to the hangul. In contrast, North Korea eliminated the use of hanja even in academic publications by 1949, a situation that has since remained unchanged.<ref name="Hannas 1997: 67"/> Hanja are often used for advertising or decorative purposes, and appear frequently in athletic events and cultural parades, dictionaries and [[atlas]]es.  For example, the hanja {{lang|ko|辛}} (''sin'' or ''shin'', meaning sour or hot) appears prominently on packages of [[Shin Ramyun]] noodles.

===Dictionaries===
In modern Korean dictionaries, all entry words of Sino-Korean origin are printed in hangul and listed in hangul order, with the hanja given in parentheses immediately following the entry word.

This practice helps to eliminate ambiguity, and it also serves as a sort of shorthand etymology, since the meaning of the hanja and the fact that the word is composed of hanja often help to illustrate the word's origin.

As an example of how hanja can help to clear up ambiguity, many homophones are written in hangul as {{lang|ko|수도}} (sudo), including:<ref>{{ko icon}} [http://hanja.naver.com/search?query=수도 Naver Hanja Dictionary query of sudo]</ref>

# {{lang|ko|修道}}: spiritual discipline
# {{lang|ko|囚徒}}: prisoner
# {{lang|ko|水都}}: "city of water" (e.g. Venice or Suzhou)
# {{lang|ko|水稻}}: [[paddy rice]]
# {{lang|ko|水道}}: drain, rivers, path of surface water
# {{lang|ko|隧道}}: [[tunnel]]
# {{lang|ko|首都}}: capital (city)

Hanja dictionaries (''Jajeon'' ({{lang|ko|자전, 字典}}) or ''Okpyeon'' ({{lang|ko|옥편, 玉篇}})) are organized by [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]] (the traditional Chinese method of classifying characters).

===Personal names===
[[Korean name|Korean personal names]] are generally based on hanja, although some exceptions exist. On business cards, the use of hanja is slowly fading away, with most older people displaying their names in hanja while most of the younger generation uses [[hangul]]. Korean personal names usually consist of a one-character family name (seong, {{lang|ko|성, 姓}}) followed by a two-character given name (ireum, {{lang|ko|이름}}). There are a few two-character family names (e.g. {{lang|ko|남궁, 南宮}}, Namgung), and the holders of such names—but not only them—tend to have one-syllable given names. Traditionally, the given name in turn consists of one character unique to the individual and one character shared by all people in a family of the same sex and generation (see [[Generation name]]). During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese administration]] of Korea (1910–1945), Koreans [[Sōshi-kaimei|were encouraged to adopt Japanese-style names]], including [[kun'yomi|polysyllabic readings]] of the hanja, but this practice was reversed by post-independence governments in Korea. Since the 1970s, some parents have given their children [[given names]] that break the Chinese generation style, and are simply native Korean words. Popular ones include ''haneul''—meaning "sky"—and ''iseul''—meaning "morning dew".  Nevertheless, on official documents, people's names are still recorded in both hangul and in hanja (if the name is composed of hanja).

===Toponymy===
Due to standardization efforts during [[Goryeo]] and [[Joseon dynasty|Joseon]] eras, native Korean [[placenames]] were converted to hanja, and most names used today are hanja-based.  The most notable exception is the name of the capital, [[Seoul]], a native Korean word meaning "capital" with no direct hanja conversion; the hanja ''gyeong'' ({{lang|ko|경, 京}}, "capital") is sometimes used as a back-rendering.  For example, disyllabic names of railway lines, freeways, and provinces are often formed by taking one character from each of the two locales' names; thus,
* The [[Gyeongbu]] ({{lang|ko|경부, 京釜}}) corridor connects Seoul (''gyeong'', {{lang|ko|京}}) and [[Busan]] (''bu'', {{lang|ko|釜}});
* The [[Gyeongin]] ({{lang|ko|경인, 京仁}}) corridor connects Seoul and [[Incheon]] (''in'', {{lang|ko|仁}});
* The former [[Jeolla]] ({{lang|ko|전라, 全羅}}) Province took its name from the first characters in the city names [[Jeonju]] ({{lang|ko|전주, 全州}}) and [[Naju]] ({{lang|ko|나주, 羅州}}) ("Naju" is originally "Raju," but the initial "r/l" sound in South Korean is simplified to "n").

Most atlases of Korea today are published in two versions: one in hangul (sometimes with some English as well), and one in hanja.  Subway and railway station signs give the station's name in hangul, hanja, and English, both to assist visitors (including Chinese or Japanese who may rely on the hanja spellings) and to disambiguate the name.

===Popular usage===
{{See also|Korean mixed script}}

Opinion surveys in South Korea regarding the issue of hanja use have had mixed responses in the past. Hanja terms are also expressed through [[hangul]], the standard script in the Korean language. Hanja use within general Korean literature has declined significantly since the 1980s because formal hanja education in South Korea does not begin until the seventh year of schooling, due to changes in government policy during the time. In 1956, one study found mixed-script Korean text (in which [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] nouns are written using hanja, and other words using hangul) were read faster than texts written purely in hangul; however, by 1977, the situation had reversed.<ref>Taylor and Taylor 1983: 90</ref> In 1988, 80% of one sample of people without a college education "evinced no reading comprehension of any but the simplest, most common hanja" when reading mixed-script passages.<ref>Brown 1990: 119</ref>

==Gukja==
{{See also|Kokuji}}
A small number of characters were invented by Koreans themselves. These characters are called ''gukja'' ({{lang|ko|국자, 國字}}, literally "national characters"). Most of them are for proper names (place-names and people's names) but some refer to Korean-specific concepts and materials. They include {{lang|ko|畓}} ({{lang|ko|논 답}}; ''non dap''; "paddyfield"), {{lang|ko|乭}} (''Dol'', a character only used in given names), {{lang|ko|㸴}} (''So'', a rare surname from [[Seongju County|Seongju]]), and {{lang|ko|怾}} (''Gi'', an old name referring to [[Mount Kumgang|Kumgangsan]]).

Further examples include {{lang|ko|媤}} ({{lang|ko|시}} ''si''), {{lang|ko|㕦/夻}} ({{lang|ko|화}} ''hwa''), {{lang|ko|巭}} ({{lang|ko|부}} ''bu''), {{lang|ko|頉}} ({{lang|ko|탈}} ''tal''), {{lang|ko|䭏}} ({{lang|ko|편}} ''pyeon''), and {{lang|ko|哛}} ({{lang|ko|뿐}} ''ppun'').

Compare to the parallel development in Japan of {{Nihongo||国字|[[kokuji]]}}, of which there are hundreds, many rarely used—these were often developed for native Japanese plants and animals.

===Yakja===
[[Image:Eopseul mu yakja.png|thumb|Yakja ({{lang|ko|약자, [[wikt:略字|略字]]}}) simplification of {{lang|ko|[[wikt:無|無]]}}]]

Some hanja characters have simplified forms ({{lang|ko|약자, [[wikt:略字|略字]]}}, ''yakja'') that can be seen in casual use. An example is [[Image:Eopseul mu yakja.png|20px]], which is a cursive form of {{lang|ko|無}} (meaning "nothing").

==Pronunciation==
Each hanja character is pronounced as a single syllable, corresponding to a single composite character in hangul. The [[pronunciation]] of hanja in Korean is not identical to the way they are pronounced in modern Chinese, particularly [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], although some Chinese dialects and Korean share similar pronunciations for some characters. For example, {{lang|ko|印刷}} "print" is ''yìnshuā'' in Mandarin Chinese and ''inswae'' ({{lang|ko|인쇄}}) in Korean, but it is pronounced ''insue'' in [[Shanghainese]] (a [[Wu Chinese]] dialect). One obvious difference is the complete loss{{Dubious|reason=It is questionable whether Old Chinese had a tone system in 2nd–1st century BC, when the importation of hanja started.  The notion of losing something that doesn't exist is absurd.|date=June 2011}} of [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] from Korean while all Chinese dialects retain tone. In other aspects, the pronunciation of hanja is more conservative than most northern and central Chinese dialects, for example in the retention of [[labial consonant]] [[syllable coda|coda]]s in characters with [[labial consonant]] [[syllable onset|onset]]s, such as the characters {{lang|ko|法}} ({{lang|ko|법}} ''beop'') and {{lang|ko|凡}} ({{lang|ko|범}} ''beom''); the labial codas existed in [[Middle Chinese]] but do not survive intact in most northern and central Chinese varieties today.

Due to divergence in pronunciation since the time of borrowing, sometimes the pronunciation of a hanja and its corresponding [[hanzi]] may differ considerably. For example, {{lang|ko|女}} ("woman") is ''nǚ'' in Mandarin Chinese and ''nyeo'' ({{lang|ko|녀}}) in Korean.  However, in most modern Korean dialects (especially [[South Korea]]n ones), {{lang|ko|女}} is pronounced as ''yeo'' ({{lang|ko|여}}) when used in an initial position, due to a systematic [[elision]] of initial ''n'' when followed by ''y'' or ''i''.

Additionally, sometimes a hanja-derived word will have altered pronunciation of a character to reflect Korean pronunciation shifts, for example mogwa {{lang|ko|모과 木瓜}} "quince" from mokgwa {{lang|ko|목과}}, and moran {{lang|ko|모란 牡丹}} "Paeonia suffruticosa" from mokdan {{lang|ko|목단}}.

There are some pronunciation correspondence between the onset, rhyme, and coda between [[Cantonese]] and Korean.<ref>Patrick Chun Kau Chu. (2008). [http://www.patrickchu.net/uploads/9/0/5/3/9053324/2008_prfl_ppt.pdf Onset, Rhyme and Coda Corresponding Rules of the Sino-Korean Characters between Cantonese and Korean]. Paper presented at the 5th Postgraduate Research Forum on Linguistics (PRFL), Hong Kong, China, March 15–16.</ref>

When learning how to write hanja, students are taught to memorize the native Korean pronunciation for the hanja's meaning and the Sino-Korean pronunciations (the pronunciation based on the Chinese pronunciation of the characters) for each hanja respectively so that students know what the syllable and meaning is for a particular hanja. For example, the name for the hanja 水 is 물 수 (mul-su) in which 물 (mul) is the native Korean pronunciation for "water", while 수 (su) is the Sino-Korean pronunciation of the character. The naming of hanja is similar to if "water" were named "water-aqua", "horse-equus", or "gold-aurum" based on a hybridization of both the English and the Latin names. Other examples include 사람 인 (saram-in) for 人 "person/people", 큰 대 (keun-dae) for 大 "big/large//great", 작을 소 (jakeul-so) for 小 "small/little", 아래 하 (arae-ha) for 下 "underneath/below/low", 아비 부 (abi-bu) for 父 "father", and 나라이름 한 (naraireum-han) for 韓 "Han/Korea".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Chinese characters|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chinese_characters&oldid=710338027|journal=Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia|language=en}}</ref>
