==History==
The American Film Institute was founded by a 1965 presidential mandate announced in the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] of the [[White House]] by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] – to establish a national arts organization to preserve the legacy of [[American film]] heritage, educate the next generation of filmmakers and honor the artists and their work. Two years later, in 1967, AFI was established, supported by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moviemaker.com/archives/moviemaking/directing/articles-directing/summer-2002-afi-3378/|title=AFI Conservatory: Still the Program of Choice|publisher=MovieMaker|date=June 21, 2002}}</ref>

The original 22-member [[Board of Trustees]] included Chair [[Gregory Peck]] and Vice Chair [[Sidney Poitier]] as well as [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Jack Valenti]] and other representatives from the arts and academia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/175/gallery/jean-picker-firstenberg|title=Jean Picker Firstenberg|publisher=Mount Holyoke College}}</ref>

The institute established a training program for filmmakers known then as the Center for Advanced Film Studies. Also created in the early years were a repertory film exhibition program at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] and the [[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] — a scholarly source for American film history. The institute moved to its current eight-acre [[Hollywood]] campus in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2007/film/awards/afi-s-departing-chief-looks-back-1117966388/|title=AFI’s departing chief looks back|publisher=Variety|date=June 6, 2007}}</ref> The film training program grew into the [[AFI Conservatory]], an accredited graduate school.

AFI moved its presentation of first-run and <!--SHOULD THIS BE AMATEUR?-->[[auteur films]] from the [[Kennedy Center]] to the historic [[AFI Silver|1938 Art Deco AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center]], which now hosts two major film festivals – AFI Fest and AFI Docs – making AFI the largest nonprofit film exhibitor in the world. AFI educates audiences and recognizes artistic excellence through its awards programs and [[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10 Lists]].

==AFI Conservatory==
