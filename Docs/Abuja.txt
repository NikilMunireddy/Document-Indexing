It officially became Nigeria's capital on 12 December 1991, replacing [[Lagos]], though the latter remains the country's most populous city. Abuja's geography is defined by [[Aso Rock]], a 400-metre [[monolith]] left by [[water erosion]]. The [[Nigerian Presidential Complex|Presidential Complex]], [[Nigerian National Assembly|National Assembly]], [[Nigerian Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] and much of the city extend to the south of the rock.

The unofficial metropolitan area of Abuja has a population of well over three million and comprises the fourth largest metropolitan area in Nigeria, surpassed only by [[Lagos]], [[Kano]] and [[Ibadan]].

Significant sights include the [[Nigerian National Mosque]] and the [[Nigerian National Christian Centre]]. The city is served by the [[Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport]].  Abuja is known for being one of the few purpose-built capital cities in Africa as well as being one of the wealthiest.<ref>Murray, Senan.

== History ==
[[File:Nigeriahouseofreps.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[National Assembly (Nigeria)|Nigeria's National Assembly]] in Abuja]] 
The indigenous inhabitants of Abuja are the [[Gbagyi]] (Gwari) as the major language, Bassa, Gwandara, Gade, Ganagana,  Koro   etc. In light of the ethnic and religious [[Demographics of Nigeria|divisions of Nigeria]], plans had been devised since Nigeria's independence to have its capital in a place deemed neutral to all major ethnic parties, and also in close proximity to all the regions of Nigeria. The location was eventually designated in the centre of the country in the early 1970s as it signified neutrality and national unity. Another impetus for Abuja came because of [[Lagos]]' population boom that made that city overcrowded and conditions squalid. The logic used was similar to the way [[Brazil]] planned its capital, [[Brasília]]. Construction broke ground and was dedicated in the late 1970s but, due to economic and political instability, the initial stages of the city were not complete until the late 1980s.

The master plan for Abuja and the [[Federal Capital Territory (Nigeria)|Federal Capital Territory]] (FCT) was developed by International Planning Associates (IPA), a consortium of three American firms: Planning Research Corporation; [[Wallace Roberts & Todd|Wallace, McHarg, Roberts and Todd]];<ref>Elleh, Nnamdi, ''Abuja, the single most ambitious urban design project of the 20th century'' [https://books.google.com/books?ei=GZnOTeTZDKjr0QHE2-z1DQ&ct=result&id=huHVAAAAMAAJ&dq=abuja+%22Wallace%2C+McHarg%2C+Roberts+and+Todd%22&q=+%22Wallace%2C+McHarg%2C+Roberts+and+Todd%22#search_anchor]</ref> and Archisystems, a division of the Hughes Organization. The master plan for Abuja defined the general structure and major design elements of the city that are visible in its current form. More detailed design of the central areas of the capital, particularly its monumental core, was accomplished by [[Kenzo Tange]], a renowned Japanese architect, with his team of city planners at Kenzo Tange and Urtec company.

Most countries relocated their [[embassy|embassies]] to Abuja, and many maintain their former embassies as [[Consul (representative)|consulates]] in [[Lagos]], the commercial capital of Nigeria. Abuja is the headquarters of the [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and the regional headquarters of [[OPEC]]. Abuja and the FCT have experienced huge population growth; it has been reported that some areas around Abuja have been growing at 20% to 30% per year.<ref name="WBC">{{cite web |url=http://www.citiesalliance.org/cdsdb.nsf/Attachments/South+Africa+roundtable/$File/African+Regional+Roundtable+on+Upgrading+Oct00.pdf|title=World Bank Conference: African Regional Roundtable on Upgrading Low-income Settlements |accessdate=2007-08-10 |work=www.citiesalliance.org |publisher=World Bank, 3–5 October 2000, Johannesburg, South Africa, p. 16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928045105/http://www.citiesalliance.org/cdsdb.nsf/Attachments/South+Africa+roundtable/$File/African+Regional+Roundtable+on+Upgrading+Oct00.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-28}}</ref> Squatter settlements and towns have spread rapidly in and outside the city limits.<ref name="bbc"/><ref name="fig">{{cite web |url=http://www.fig.net/pub/accra/papers/ts18/ts18_01_jibril.pdf|title=Resettlement Issues, Squatter Settlements and the Problems of Land Administration in Abuja, Nigeria’s Federal Capital|accessdate=2007-08-10 |work=fig.net |publisher=5th FIG Regional Conference Accra, Ghana, 8–11 March 2006}}</ref> Tens of thousands of people have been [[eviction|evicted]] since former FCT minister [[Nasir Ahmad el-Rufai]] started a demolition campaign in 2003.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/world/africa/13abuja.html?ex=1323666000&en=9b1bb2ecd684791c&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=In a Dream City, a Nightmare OF AKIM JOHN for the Common Man |accessdate=2007-08-10 |work=nyt.com |publisher=New York Times, 13 December 2006 | first=Lydia | last=Polgreen | date=13 December 2006}}</ref>

===Central Business District===
[[File:Catedral Nacional em Abuja, Nigéria.jpg|thumbnail|[[National Church of Nigeria|National Christian Centre]]]]
Abuja's [[Central District, Abuja|Central District]], also called Central Area, spans from the foot of [[Aso Rock]], across the Three Arms Zone, to the southern base of the inner ring road. It is like the city's spinal cord, dividing it into the northern sector with Maitama and Wuse, and the southern sector with Garki and Asokoro. While each district has its own clearly demarcated commercial and residential sectors, the Central District is the city's principal Business Zone, where practically all parastatals and [[multinational corporations]] have their offices. An attractive area in the Central District is the region known as the '''Three Arms Zone''', so called because it houses the administrative offices of the executive, legislative and judicial arms of the federal government. A few of the other sites worth seeing in the area are the federal secretariats alongside Shehu Shagari Way, Aso Hill, the Abuja Plant Nursery, [[Eagle Square (Abuja)|Eagle Square]] (which has important historic significance, as it was in this grounds that the present democratic dispensation had its origin on 29 May 1999) and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier across the road facing it. The [[Abuja National Mosque|National Mosque]] and [[National Church of Nigeria]] are opposite each other on either side of Independence Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/street/16260013/Independence-Ave |title=Independence Avenue |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date=2012-11-18 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref> A well-known government office is the Ministry of Defense, colloquially nicknamed "Ship House".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/9452603/Ministry-of-Defense-Ship-House |title=Ship House |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date=2012-11-18 |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>

===Garki District===

The [[Garki District, Abuja|Garki District]] is the area in the southwest corner of the city, having the Central District to the north and the Asokoro District to the east. The district is subdivided into units called "Areas". Garki uses a distinctive naming convention of "Area" to refer to parts of Garki. These are designated as Areas 1 to 11. Garki II is used to differentiate the area from Garki Area 2.  Visitors may find this system confusing.

Garki is presently the principal business district of Abuja. Numerous buildings of interest are in this area. Some of them include the General Post Office, Abuja International Conference Centre along the busy Herbert Maculay Way, Nicon Luxury Hotel (formally known as Abuja Sofitel Hotel and Le Meridian), Agura Hotel and Old Federal Secretariat Complex Buildings (Area 1). A new five-star hotel, Hawthorn Suites Abuja, is in Garki.

Area 2 is mainly used for residential purposes, although a zoological garden as well as Garki Shopping Centre are in Area 2. Several banks and other commercial offices are located along Moshood Abiola Way in Area 7. The headquarters of the Nigerian Armed Forces – Army, Airforce and Navy – are all in the Garki District.

The tallest building in this district is the Radio House, which houses the Federal Ministry of Information and Communications, and the [[Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria]] (FRCN). The [[Nigerian Television Authority]] (NTA) stations and corporate headquarters are based in Garki. The Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) which oversees and runs the Administration of the Federal Capital Territory has its offices in Garki.

The Office of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja is in Area 10. Other places of note include the Arts and Culture Centre and The Nigerian Police Mobile Force headquarters in Area 10. The Abuja Municipal Area Council, which is the local government administration has its headquarters in Area 10. The new United States Embassy is in the Garki district.

===Wuse District===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Abuja suburbs.jpg|A house in Wuse District, a suburban area of Abuja|thumb]] -->

[[Wuse District, Abuja|Wuse District]] is the northwestern part of the city, with the Maitama District to its north and the Central District to its south. The District is numbered Zones 1–8. The Wuse Market is Abuja's principal market (Zone 5). The second most important post office in the city is here. This district houses the Sheraton Hotel and Towers (Zone 4), Ibro International hotel, the Foreign Affairs Ministry Headquarters (Zone 3) and Nigerian Customs Services Headquarters, Federal Civil Service Commission (Zone 3), Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration (NAFDAC) (Zone 7), Wuse General Hospital, and the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation. Just as Garki District has Garki II, Wuse has Wuse II. This is distinct from Wuse Zone 2.

===Maitama District===
[[File:Millennium Park Abuja1.jpg|thumbnail|[[Millennium Park (Abuja)|Millennium Park]] in Maitama district]]
[[Maitama District, Abuja|Maitama District]] is to the north of the city, with the Wuse and Central Districts lying to its southwest and southeast respectively. This area is home to the top bracket sections of society and business, and has the reputation of being very exclusive and very expensive. Interesting buildings include the [[Transcorp Hilton Hotel]], [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] Headquarters (NCC), [[National Universities Commission]] (NUC), Soil Conservation Complex, and [[Independent National Electoral Commission]] (INEC). The British High Commission is located along [[Aguiyi Ironsi]] Way, in Maitama. Also, the Maitama District Hospital is another notable building in Maitama. Maitama District is home to many of the European and Asian embassies.

===Asokoro District===

[[Asokoro District, Abuja|Asokoro District]], the [[doyen]] of the districts, houses all of the state's lodges/guest houses. The ECOWAS secretariat is a focal point of interest. Asokoro is to the east of Garki district and south of Central district. It is one of the most exclusive districts of Abuja and houses virtually all of the federal cabinet ministers; in addition, the Presidential Palace (commonly referred to as the Aso Rock) is in Asokoro district. By virtue of this fact, Asokoro is the most secure area of the city.

===Gwarinpa District===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:abujashop.jpg|right|thumb|One of Abuja's shopping centres]] -->

[[Gwarinpa District, Abuja|Gwarinpa]] is the last district in the Abuja Municipal Area Council. It is a 20-kilometer drive from the central district and contains the largest single housing estate in Nigeria, the Gwarinpa Housing Estate. The estate was built by the administration of General [[Sani Abacha]] and is the largest of its kind in Africa. It provides residence for the majority of the civil servants in federal ministries and government [[parastatal]]s. The ECOWAS Court has an official quarters for the President and Members of the Court in Gwarinpa.

===Durumi District===
Durumi District is located southwest of Abuja and is bordered by Garki Districts I and II to the northeast. Its borders are the Oladipo Dia Road to the southwest, the Nnamdi Azikiwe Express Way to the northeast, and Ahmadu Bello Way to the southeast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Durumi (Abuja) Nigeria / Abuja Federal Capital Territory / Zubo / Abuja|url=http://wikimapia.org/15356368/Durumi|publisher=http://wikimapia.org/|accessdate=22 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Abuja F.C.C.

==Climate==

Abuja under [[Köppen climate classification]] features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw''). The FCT experiences three weather conditions annually. This includes a warm, humid [[rainy season]] and a blistering [[dry season]]. In between the two, there is a brief interlude of [[harmattan]] occasioned by the northeast trade wind, with the main feature of [[Haze|dust haze]] and dryness.

The rainy season begins from April and ends in October, when daytime temperatures reach {{convert|28|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}}  and nighttime lows hover around {{convert|22|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|23|°C|°F|1}}. In the dry season, daytime temperatures can soar as high as {{convert|40|°C|°F|1}} and nighttime temperatures can dip to {{convert|12|°C|°F|1}}. Even the chilliest nights can be followed by daytime temperatures well above {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}}. The high altitudes and undulating terrain of the FCT act as a moderating influence on the weather of the territory.

Rainfall in the FCT reflects the territory's location on the windward side of the [[Jos Plateau]] and the zone of rising air masses with the city receiving frequent rainfall during the rainy season from March to November every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touristlink.com/nigeria/abuja/overview.html |title=Abuja Nigeria Tourist Information |publisher=Touristlink.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref>

===Vegetation===

The FCT falls within the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] zone of the West African sub-region. Patches of [[rain forest]], however, occur in the [[Gwagwa]] plains, especially in the rugged terrain to the south southeastern parts of the territory, where a landscape of gullies and rough terrain is found. These areas of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) form one of the few surviving occurrences of the mature forest vegetation in Nigeria.

==Skyline and landmarks==

The Abuja skyline is made up of mostly mid-range and a few tall buildings. Only recently have tall buildings begun to appear. Most of the buildings are modern, reflecting that it is a new city.

Plans have been made to build [[skyscraper]]s such as the [[Millennium Tower (Abuja)|Millennium Tower]] which is currently under construction. When finished, this structure will loom 170 meters above the city. The tower will be part of a huge cultural development complex called the Nigeria National Complex including the Nigeria Cultural Centre, a 120.000 m<sup>2</sup> structure dedicated to the art and culture of Nigeria. The Cultural Centre and the Millennium Tower have been designed by the Italian architect [[Manfredi Nicoletti]].

Landmarks include the [[Millennium Tower (Abuja)|Millennium Tower]] (which is currently under construction), the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] headquarters, the [[Nigerian Presidential Complex]], the Ship House, the [[Abuja National Stadium|National Stadium]], [[Abuja National Mosque|National Mosque]], the [[National Church of Nigeria|National Church]], [[Aso Rock]] and [[Zuma Rock]]
