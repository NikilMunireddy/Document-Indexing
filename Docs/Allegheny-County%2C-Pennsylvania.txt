'''Allegheny County''' is a [[County (United States)|county]] in the southwestern part of the U.S. state of [[Pennsylvania]]. As of 2014 the population was 1,231,225,<ref>http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2014/files/CO-EST2014-alldata.csv</ref> making it the second-most populous county in Pennsylvania, following [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia County]]. The [[county seat]] is [[Pittsburgh]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=June 7, 2011|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref>
Allegheny County is included in the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area|Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The county is in the [[Pittsburgh Media Market|Pittsburgh Designated Market Area]].

Allegheny County was the first in Pennsylvania to be given a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] name, being named after the [[Allegheny River]]. The word "Allegheny" is of [[Lenape]] origin, with uncertain meaning. It is usually said to mean "fine river", but sometimes said to refer to an ancient mythical tribe called "Allegewi" that lived along the river long ago before being destroyed by the Lenape.<ref>{{cite book |last= Stewart |first= George R. |authorlink= George R.

==History ==
Not a great deal is known about the native inhabitants of the region prior to European contact. During the colonial era various native groups claimed or settled in the area, resulting in a multi-ethnic mix that included [[Iroquois]], [[Lenape]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Mingo]]. European fur traders such as [[Peter Chartier]] established trading posts in the region in the early eighteenth century.

In 1749 Captain [[Pierre Joseph Céloron de Blainville]], claimed the [[Ohio Valley]] and all of western Pennsylvania for [[Louis XV of France]]. The captain traveled along the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and Allegheny rivers inserting lead plates in the ground to mark the land for France.

Since most of the towns during that era were developed along [[waterway]]s, both the French and the British desired control over the local rivers. Therefore, the British sent Major [[George Washington]] to try to compel the French to leave their posts, with no success. Having failed in his mission, he returned and nearly drowned crossing the ice-filled Allegheny River. In 1754, the English tried again to enter the area. This time, they sent 41 Virginians to build [[Fort Prince George]]. The French got news of the plan and sent an army to take over the fort, which they then resumed building with increased fortification, renaming it [[Fort Duquesne]].

The loss of the fort cost the English dearly because Fort Duquesne became one of the focal points of the [[French and Indian War]]. The first attempt to retake the fort, the [[Braddock Expedition]], failed miserably.<ref>Fiske, John (1902). [http://books.google.com/books?id=DiATAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA290 ''New France and New England''], pp. 290–92. Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> It was not until General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|John Forbes]] attacked in 1758, four years after they had lost the original fort, that they recaptured and destroyed it. They subsequently built a new fort on the site, including a moat, and named it [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]]. The site is now Pittsburgh's [[Point State Park]].

Both Pennsylvania and [[Virginia]] claimed the region that is now Allegheny County.  Pennsylvania administered most of the region as part of its [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland County]]. Virginia considered everything south of the [[Ohio River]] and east of the [[Allegheny River]] to be part of its [[Yohogania County]] and governed it from [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Dunmore]]. In addition, parts of the county were located in the proposed British colony of [[Vandalia (colony)|Vandalia]] and the proposed U.S. state of [[Westsylvania]].  The overlapping boundaries, multiple governments, and confused deed claims soon proved unworkable. In 1780 Pennsylvania and Virginia agreed to extend the [[Mason–Dixon line]] westward, and the region became part of Pennsylvania. From 1781 until 1788, much of what had been claimed as part of Yohogania County, Virginia, was administered as a part of the newly created [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]].

Allegheny County was officially created on September 24, 1788, from parts of [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] counties. It was formed due to pressure from settlers living in the area around Pittsburgh, which became the [[county seat]] in 1791. The county originally extended all the way north to the shores of [[Lake Erie]] and became the "mother county" for most of what is now northwestern Pennsylvania. By 1800, the county's current borders were set.

In the 1790s, a [[whiskey]] excise tax was imposed by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]]. This started the so-called [[Whiskey Rebellion]] when the farmers who depended on whiskey income refused to pay and drove off tax collector [[John Neville (general)|John Neville]]. After a series of demonstrations by farmers, President [[George Washington]] sent troops to stop the rebellion.

The area developed rapidly throughout the 19th century to become the center of [[steel]] production in the nation. Pittsburgh would later be labeled the "Steel Capital of the World".

==Geography==
According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|745|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|730|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|14|sqmi}} (1.9%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_42.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=March 4, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>

Allegheny County is known for the three major rivers that flow through it:  the [[Allegheny River]] and the [[Monongahela River]] converge at [[Downtown Pittsburgh]] to form the [[Ohio River]]. The [[Youghiogheny River]] flows into the Monongahela River at [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} southeast. Several islands are located within the riverine systems. Water from these rivers eventually flows into the [[Gulf of Mexico]] via the [[Mississippi River]]. Although the county's industrial growth caused the [[clearcutting]] of forests, a significant woodland remains.

==Law and government==
For most of the 20th century, until 1999, Allegheny County was governed exclusively under the state's Second Class County Code. Under this code, the county handled everything: elections, prisons, airports, public health and city planning. Unlike the rest of the state, where certain public offices are combined and held by one person, in Allegheny County all public offices are held by elected individuals.

Before the implementation of the home-rule charter on January 1, 2000, there were three county [[commissioner]]s. These were replaced with an elected chief officer (the county executive), a county council with 15 members (13 elected by district, two elected county-wide), and an appointed county manager. The changes were intended to maintain a separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches while providing the citizens with greater control over the government.

The county has 130 municipalities, each governing itself; no other county in Pennsylvania has nearly as many, with [[Luzerne County, Pennsylvania|Luzerne County's]] 76 being second.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pamunicipalitiesinfo.com |title=Pennsylvania Municipalities Information |publisher=Pamunicipalitiesinfo.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref> The county has one Second Class City (Pittsburgh) and three Third Class Cities ([[Clairton, Pennsylvania|Clairton]], [[Duquesne, Pennsylvania|Duquesne]], and [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania|McKeesport]]).

A 2004 study by the [[University of Pittsburgh]] stated that Allegheny County would be better served by consolidating the southeastern portion of the county (which includes many small, poor communities) into one large municipality, called "Rivers City", which would have a combined population of approximately 250,000.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04172/334816.stm |title=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=December 31, 1969 |accessdate=August 16, 2012 |first=Jeffrey |last=Cohan}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{see also|Economy of Pittsburgh}}
In the late 18th century [[farming]] played a critical role in the growth of the area. There was a surplus of grain due to transportation difficulties in linking with the eastern portion of the state. As a result, the farmers distilled the grain into [[whiskey]], which significantly helped the farmers financially.

The area quickly became one of the key manufacturing areas in the young nation. Coupled with deposits of iron and coal, and the easy access to waterways for [[barge]] traffic, the city quickly became one of the most important steel producing areas in the world.  Based on 2007 data from the US Army Corps of Engineers, Pittsburgh is the second busiest inland port in the nation.

With the decline of the steel industry in the US, the area shifted to other industries. Today, it is known for its hospitals, universities, and industrial centers. Despite the decline of [[heavy industry]], Pittsburgh is home to a number of major companies and is ranked in the [http://www.downtownpittsburgh.com/doingBusinessDowntown.aspx top ten] among US cities hosting headquarters of Fortune 500 corporations. These include [[U.S. Steel]] Corporation, [[PNC Financial Services]] Group, [[PPG Industries]], and [[H. J. Heinz Company]].

The county leads the commonwealth in number of [[U.S. Department of Defense|defense contractors]] supplying the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11338/1194201-455-0.stm |title=Automatic defense cuts would affect some contractors in Pittsburgh region – Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publisher=Post-gazette.com |date=July 3, 2012 |accessdate=August 16, 2012}}</ref>

* '''Allentown Borough''' – now the neighborhood of Allentown in Pittsburgh.
* [[Birmingham, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|'''Birmingham Borough''']] – what is now Pittsburgh's South Side.
* '''Carrick Borough''' – now the neighborhood of Carrick. Formed out of Baldwin Township in 1904, this borough existed until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1927. It was named for Carrick-on-Suir, Ireland.  To this day, some of the [[manhole cover]]s bear the Carrick Borough name.

* '''Northern Liberties Borough''' – in what is now the [[Strip District]] of Pittsburgh. The borough was annexed to Pittsburgh in 1837 as the first addition to the city's original territory.
* [[Peebles Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|'''Peebles Township''']] – included most of what is now the eastern part of the city of Pittsburgh from the Monongahela River in the south (today's [[Hazelwood (Pittsburgh)|Hazelwood]]) to the Allegheny River in the north. It was subdivided into Collins and Liberty townships, all of which were incorporated into Pittsburgh in 1868.
* [[St. Clair Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|'''St. Clair Township''']] – stretched from the Monongahela River south to the Washington County line.
