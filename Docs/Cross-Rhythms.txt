'''Cross Rhythms''' is a Christian media organisation based in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], England. It operates an FM and online radio station, produces radio shows sent internationally, and its website has resources on [[contemporary Christian music]].

==History==
{{See also|Cross Rhythms (magazine)|Cross Rhythms City Radio}}
In 1983, broadcaster Chris Cole started a 30-minute weekly Christian music radio show on [[Plymouth Sound FM]], an [[Independent Local Radio]] station in [[Plymouth]]. Originally titled ''The Solid Rock of Jesus Christ'', the programme aired on Sunday evenings. It grew into a one-hour programme, and became one of the most listened to programmes in its time slot in South Devon.<ref name="Issue 85">{{Cite journal|date=9 August 2005|title=The End of the Beginning|journal=[[Cross Rhythms (magazine)|Cross Rhythms]]|issue=85|pages=6â€“10|location=[[Stoke-on-Trent]]|publisher=Cross Rhythms|editor1-first=Tony|editor1-last=Cummings|editor1-link=Tony Cummings|issn=0967-540X|oclc=500051110|accessdate=3 August 2012|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/The_End_Of_The_Beginning_Website_success_puts_CR_magazine_on_hold/15588/p1/}}</ref> The show continued until 1996.

In May 1990, music journalist [[Tony Cummings]] founded the magazine ''[[Cross Rhythms (magazine)|Cross Rhythms Magazine]]''. In 1991, publication of the magazine was taken over by Cole's publishing company, Cornerstone House. The radio show was renamed the ''Cross Rhythms Experience'' in 1992 and became a syndicated show in 1993.

Also in 1991, Cross Rhythms took over the organisation and management of what had previously been the Umberleigh Rock Gospel Festival. The event was renamed to the Cross Rhythms Festival, and continued to be held annually until 2003. By 1995 the magazine had a readership of about 15,000.<ref name="CCM_18_1">{{cite journal |last=Givens |first=Steve |date=July 1995 |title=The British Are Listening! |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |issn=1524-7848 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=20 }}</ref>

Cross Rhythms, in partnership with [[United Christian Broadcasters]], launched a satellite radio channel broadcasting to the UK and Europe on digital satellite in 1998. At the same time, Cross Rhythms moved base from [[Plymouth]] to [[Stoke-on-Trent]] to share facilities with [[United Christian Broadcasters|UCB]]. The partnership continued until 2002, when Cross Rhythms was granted a pilot licence for a new form of local radio, then called Access Radio but now known as [[Community Radio]]. [[Cross Rhythms City Radio]] went on air in February 2002.  

At the same time as obtaining the FM licence for [[Cross Rhythms City Radio]], Cross Rhythms moved out of UCB's HQ and into Conway House, the former home of [[BBC Radio Stoke]]. 

The last Cross Rhythms Festival was held in 2003 and Cross Rhythms Magazine ceased publication in 2005. The festival was subsequently re-launched as a partnership with Gilead Foundations under the new name of the Arrow Festival. The editorial content of the magazine is now carried by the Cross Rhythms Website. In order to help finance the expansion of the radio aspect of the organisation, Cross Rhythms Direct was launched in 2003 as an online Christian music shop. It has a chart system and the highest selling artists include [[Chris Tomlin]], [[Lou Fellingham]], and [[Hillsong Music Australia|Hillsong]].

==Programming and publications==
As well as operating [[Cross Rhythms City Radio]] and the Cross Rhythms website, which has a review section of [[Christian music]] releases, and life-based articles by a selection of writers including [[Mal Fletcher]] and [[Paul Poulton]], Cross Rhythms also provides syndicated radio programming for a number of other radio stations, mostly community based, and music review content for several publications including the UK Christian retail trade magazine [[Christian Marketplace]]. 

==The Cross Rhythms Brand==
The name "Cross Rhythms" is also used by two other UK community radio stations, [[Cross Rhythms Plymouth]] - officially launched on 29 March 2007 and Cross Rhythms Teesside 107.1 FM, officially launched on 27 April 2008. Although using the name, these stations are under separate ownership as required by Ofcom regulations. The use of the Cross Rhythms brand is part of a [[Franchising|franchise]] agreement whereby the new stations will take syndicated programming from Cross Rhythms outside their own core broadcasting hours while retaining full [[editorial independence]].
