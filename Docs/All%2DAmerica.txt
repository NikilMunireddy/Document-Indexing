{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}
An '''All-America''' team is a hypothetical American sports team composed of outstanding [[amateur]] players. These players are broadly considered by media and other relevant commentators as the best players, of a specific season, for each team position.

Such athletes at the high school and college level are given the honorific title and typically referred to as "All-American [[Sportsperson|athletes]]" or simply "All-Americans".

==Term usage==
As of 2009, the term is used in [[United States|U.S.]] [[team]] sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national [[Mass media|media]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The term is used primarily with regard to [[college]] and, occasionally, to [[high school]] players.

Note that similar terms exist for non-amateur athletes: outstanding [[professional#Sports|professional]] players usually are referred to as "[[all-star#Sports|All-Stars]]", or, in the case of professional [[American football]], "All-Pros": (as opposed to [[Pro Bowl]]ers, who are selected by players, coaches, and fans to compete in [[Pro Bowl]] games).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Selection to an All-America team for collegiate (or high-school) players, however, is honorary in nature. "All-America teams" do not typically play any games as a unit, unlike many of the all-star teams.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The original use of the term "All-America" seems to have been in reference to a list of [[college football]] players who were regarded as the best at their respective positions. The first "All-America" team was the [[1889 College Football All-America Team]] selected by [[Caspar Whitney]] and published in ''This Week's Sports'' in association with [[Walter Camp]].<ref>The All-America Team for 1889 selected by Casper Whitney is identified in the [http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4844195/Awards-compiled-NCAA-2008-Record-Book-Division-1-Football NCAA guide to football award winners] {{wayback|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4844195/Awards-compiled-NCAA-2008-Record-Book-Division-1-Football |date=20090714223946 }}</ref>

===Other uses===
The use of the term has been expanded to honor persons outside of the field of sports, especially informally; for example an individual may be popularly referred to as, an "All-America" level entertainer, educator, or other activity which does not have anything to do with athletics.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In Triathlons, USAT bestows the All American status on the top 10% within their age group. As of January, 2014, Triathlons are now NCAA approved for women.

The term has also been used in athletics in new ways to recognize the academic achievements of student-athletes as "Academic All-America" teams are named.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070913161839/http://www.cosida.com/allamerica/default.asp – Academic All-America Teams as selected by CoSIDA]</ref> The term "Academic All-America" is a registered trademark of the [[Sports information director|College Sports Information Directors of America]], which began the program in 1952 to recognize college athletes at all levels of competition and in all collegiate sports.

The term "All-American" is also [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] used to describe stereotypically clean-cut, mainstream or conventional [[American middle class]] people, particularly [[Adolescence|teenagers]] and [[Youth|young adults]]. Phenotypically, the stereotype suggests a blond-haired, light-eyed, [[White Anglo Saxon Protestant|WASP]], [[Northern European]], or "[[Nordic race|nordic]]" appearance. This usage was popularized by the radio series [[Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy]], which ran from 1933 to 1951. The "mainstream" culture was dominated by white Americans, but this connotation is changing along with demographics and acceptance of a multi-racial society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/07/04/137609363/do-americas-changing-demographics-impact-politics|title=Do America's Changing Demographics Impact Politics?|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://inamerica.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/06/can-there-ever-again-be-an-all-american-beauty/ |title=Can there ever again be an 'all-American' beauty?|date= April 6, 2012 |last=Springer |first=Sarah |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |work=CNN}}</ref>

The [[United States Army]] [[82nd Airborne Division]] was given the nickname "All-American" because its members came from all 48 U.S. states which, at that time, constituted the United States ([[Hawaii]] and [[Alaska]] did not [[List of US states|enter]] the union until 1959).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Collegiate sports==
Each year different sets of All-American teams are recognized toward consensus and unanimous selection recognition. A "unanimous selection" is a player who is listed as a first team All-American by all recognized lists. A "consensus All-American" is a player who is listed as a first team All-American by at least half of the recognized lists.
