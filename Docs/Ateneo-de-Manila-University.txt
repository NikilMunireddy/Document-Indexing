The '''Ateneo de Manila University''' ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''Pamantasang Ateneo de Manila;'' [[Spanish language|Spanish]]'': Universidad Ateneo de Manila'') is a private research university in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]. Founded in 1859 by the [[Society of Jesus]], the Ateneo is the third-oldest university in the Philippines. Ateneo offers elementary and secondary education exclusively to male students. The undergraduate and graduate programmes are coeducational and organized into four schools, collectively known as the [[Loyola Schools]], which are located at its main campus at Loyola Heights. Four professional schools occupy campuses in different parts of [[Metro Manila]].

Ateneo undergraduates follow a [[Catholic]]-rooted [[liberal arts]] curriculum throughout their programs in the Humanities, Social Sciences, Science and Engineering, or Business Management. The [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] has recognized its units in biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, information technology, entrepreneurship education, English literature, philosophy, sociology, psychology, and business administration as Centers of Excellence while the communication, electronics engineering, environmental science, history, Filipino literature, and political science units have been declared Centers of Development. The Loyola Heights campus also hosts two chemistry research centers: Philippine Institute of Pure and Applied Chemistry (PIPAC) and National Chemistry Instrumentation Center (NCIC).

<!-- ==Summary history==
===1859 to 1959===
While Jesuit teaching efforts in Manila date back to 1595, the Ateneo de Manila University traces its founding to 1859 when the Jesuits, at the behest of the Governor-General, took charge of the Municipal School of Manila, a small school for the children of Spanish residents. In 1865 when it became accredited as a secondary school its name was changed to "Ateneo Municipal de Manila". It began offering the bachelor's degree, as well as courses leading to certificates in agriculture, surveying, and business. When Americans occupied the Philippines in the early 1900s, its subsidy from the city was withdrawn. The Jesuits removed the word "Municipal" from the school’s name and it became simply Ateneo de Manila. In 1908, the American colonial government licensed the Ateneo’s bachelor degree and certificates in various disciplines. The Ateneo campus housed other Jesuit institutions of research and learning such as the Manila Observatory and San Jose Major Seminary.
[[File:Heritage Bells.jpg|150px|right|]]
American Jesuits replaced their Spanish brethren in 1912. In 1932 the original campus at Intramuros in the heart of old Manila was destroyed by fire and the Ateneo moved to the San Jose Major Seminary grounds in [[Padre Faura]], [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]]. Again during [[World War II]] the Ateneo campus was devastated. The Ateneo reopened temporarily in Plaza Guipit in Sampaloc, Manila. The Padre Faura campus reopened in 1946 with [[Quonset hut]]s serving as buildings among the campus ruins.<ref name="reyes">Soledad S. Reyes.

''Ateneo Alumni Guidon'', Vol. VII No. I, Vol. VII No. 2, and Vol. VIII No. 1</ref> In 1952, [[William Masterson|Fr. William F. Masterson, S.J.]], moved most of the Ateneo units to its present Loyola Heights campus. The Padre Faura campus continued to house the professional schools until 1976. Fr. Francisco Araneta, S.J., was appointed as the Ateneo de Manila's first Filipino Rector in 1958. In 1959, its centennial year, the Ateneo became a university.

===1960 to 2015===
On 25 September 1969, Pacifico Ortiz, S.J., was installed as the first Filipino President of the Ateneo de Manila.<ref name="guidon1">''The Guidon'' October 2004</ref> At this time the Graduate School split into the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and what would become the Graduate School of Business. In 1968 the Ateneo co-founded the [[Asian Institute of Management]].<ref name="AIM">[http://www.aim.edu.ph/content.aspx?id=151 "Historical Highlights"]. [c. 2008]. Asian Institute of Management Website. Retrieved 2010-02-13.</ref>
As student activism rose in the 1970s, Ateneans took an active role along with student organisations from other colleges and universities.<ref name="downfromthehill">Cristina Jayme Montiel and Susan Evangelista, eds. ''Down from the Hill: Ateneo de Manila In the First Ten Years Under Martial Law, 1971-1982.''  Ateneo de Manila University Press. 2005. ISBN 971-550-486-8.</ref> On 11 February 1986, alumnus and Antique Governor [[Evelio Javier]] was gunned down. Two weeks later, Ateneans joined thousands of [[Filipino people|Filipinos]] from all walks of life in the peaceful uprising at EDSA which ousted Ferdinand Marcos.
The Ateneo college opened its doors to its first female students in 1973. The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences moved to Loyola Heights in 1976, and the Padre Faura campus finally closed in 1977 as the Graduate School of Business and the Law School moved to H.V. de la Costa St. in Salcedo Village, Makati. In February 1978, the Ateneo opened what would become the Ateneo Computer Technology Center. 
[[File:Science Education Complex.jpg|thumb|Science Education Complex]]
In 1991 the School of Law became the first Philippine law school to confer the [[Juris Doctor]] degree. The Ateneo School of Government was established in 1996 and in 1998 Ateneo’s Rockwell campus, which would house the Ateneo Graduate School of Business, Ateneo Law School, and Ateneo School of Government, was completed in Rockwell Centre in Bel-Air, Makati. Also, the Science Education Complex was completed in the Loyola Heights campus.<br>
In 2000, the School of Arts and Sciences which included the College and the Graduate School was restructured into four [[Loyola Schools]]: the School of Humanities, the John Gokongwei School of Management, the School of Science and Engineering, and the School of Social Sciences. In April 2002, the office of the university president established Pathways to Higher Education-Philippines, one of the university's outreach initiatives, with the help of the Ford and Synergeia Foundations. In July 2002 the university [[Church of the Gesù (Philippines)|Church of the Gesù]] was completed in the Loyola Heights campus. In 2003, the Ateneo entered into its partnership with [[Gawad Kalinga]], its first formal, university-wide social action programme.

Midway through 2006, the Manuel V Pangilinan Centre for Student Leadership was completed.<ref>[http://www.ateneo.edu/ateneo/www/UserFiles/71/ls/lsb/lsb_aug-sept06.pdf lsb_aug-sept06</ref> The [[Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health]] facility in Ortigas welcomed its first batch of professional students in June 2007.

Retrieved 13 August 2008.</ref>

The Ateneo's social projects include the Ateneo-Mangyan Project for Understanding and Development (AMPUD) and Bigay Puso in grade school and the Christian Service and Involvement Program, Damay Immersion, and Tulong Dunong programme for senior students in high school. In college, social development is fostered by programmes of the Office of Social Concern and Involvement, including house-builds with Gawad Kalinga, and the Ateneo Labor Trials Program tied into junior Philosophy classes. Student organizations and offices of the Loyola Schools also operate their own social involvement programmes.<ref name="pr2005"/><ref name="pr2006">Ateneo de Manila University President's Report 2006</ref> At the Ateneo Professional Schools, programmes and units like the Graduate School of Business' Mulat-Diwa, the Leaders for Health Program, the Law School's Human Rights Center and Legal Aid programmes aim to form leaders.<ref name="pr2005"/><ref name="pr2006"/> Other Ateneo initiatives include Pathways to Higher Education for gifted, underprivileged youth and the Ateneo Center for Educational Development (ACED) which conducts national teacher and principal training programmes.

The centrepiece social programme of the university is its university-wide social action programme in partnership with [[Gawad Kalinga]] which has helped build communities and schools in Payatas, [[Quezon City]], in many [[Nueva Ecija]] municipalities, and in three villages in [[Bicol Region|Bicol]]. GK-Ateneo has also driven Kalinga Luzon, the massive rehabilitation effort for victims of the late 2004 Luzon typhoons, GK Youth-Ateneo, arguably the largest and most active student social programme of the Ateneo, Kalinga Leyte, an ongoing programme which aims to provide long-term rehabilitation for the victims of the [[Southern Leyte]] landslide, and ongoing reconstruction efforts for typhoon-stricken Bicol.<ref name="pr2005"/><ref name="pr2006"/><ref name="aweboutreach">{{cite web|url=http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=6|title=Ateneo de Manila University - Ateneo de Manila University|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>

The Ateneo de Manila is governed by a Board of Trustees chaired by alumnus Edward Go, who succeeded [[Manuel V. Pangilinan]]. A central administration, led by [[University President]] [[Jose Ramon Villarin|Fr. Jose Ramon T. Villarin, S.J.]], oversees key initiatives related to academics, international programmes, university development and alumni relations, personnel, security, and other university-wide concerns.<ref name="awebadmin">{{cite web|url=http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=91|title=Ateneo de Manila University - Ateneo de Manila University|publisher=|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref> Fr.

Individual units and departments are usually led by a vice president, with the exception of the basic education units which are led by a director who oversees the leadership of both the high school's principal and the grade school's headmaster. The Loyola schools and professional schools are led by their respective vice presidents who oversee school deans, who in turn oversee department chairs and programme directors.

In 2005, the Loyola Schools programmes of the Ateneo have been granted Level IV [[Education in the Philippines#Accreditation|accreditation]]—the highest possible level—from the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED) through the Federation of Accrediting Agencies of the Philippines (FAAP) and the [[Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities]] (PAASCU).<ref>''The Guidon.''

The grade school and high school divisions both have the highest (level III) of accreditation from PAASCU and FAAP.<ref name="ahs_paascu">[http://www.ateneo.edu/index.php?p=120&type=2&sec=29&aid=6227 Ateneo High School now Level III accredited]</ref>

==Student organizations==
Among the fifty-two university-accredited student organizations, the [[Ateneo College Glee Club]] is the most internationally renowned. The oldest university chorale in the Philippines, ACGC has participated in numerous international choral and choir competitions including the [[European Grand Prix for Choral Singing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/259276/pinoyabroad/pinoyachievers/ateneo-glee-club-wins-top-prize-at-choral-fest-in-ireland|title=Ateneo Glee Club wins top prize at choral fest in Ireland|work=GMA News Online|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ateneocollegegleeclub.com/?page_id=41 Glee Club]</ref>

The Ateneo Debate Society, the premier undergraduate debate organization of the Ateneo, is the highest-ranking debate team in the Philippines and Asia, and often in the top 10 of the World University Debate Rankings since the mid-2000s, peaking at no. 7 in 2012.

<!-- ==Athletics==
{{main|Ateneo Blue Eagles}}
The Ateneo de Manila University was a founding member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] in the 1920s, but left in 1978 due to the league-wide violence prevalent at the time. It joined the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] that same year and now fields teams in all events. In 2000 the Moro Lorenzo Sports Complex was completed in the Loyola Heights campus. Aside from the UAAP, the Ateneo also participates in the Father Martin Cup, Filoil Flying V Preseason Cup, Philippine University Games (Unigames), Philippine Collegiate Championship League (PCCL), and the [[Shakey's V-League]]. Different university units also field teams in leagues such as Rizal Football Association (RIFA), Philippine Athletic Youth Association (PAYA), Private Schools Athletic Development Association (PRADA) and BEST Small Basketeers Program (SBP), the Inter-MBA Friendship Games and inter-university golf tournaments. The Ateneo also fields sports teams at the Jesuit Invitational Games (JIGs), an athletic tournament among eight Jesuit schools in the Philippines.  -->
