'''Avril Ramona Lavigne''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|v|r|ɪ|l|_|l|ə|ˈ|v|iː|n}}; {{IPA-fr|avʁil laviɲ|lang}}; born 27 September 1984)<ref>http://www.people.com/people/avril_lavigne/biography</ref> is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[singer-songwriter]] and actress. She was born in [[Belleville, Ontario]], and spent most of her youth in the town of [[Greater Napanee]]. By the age of 15, she had appeared on stage with [[Shania Twain]]; by 16, she had signed a two-album recording contract with [[Arista Records]] worth more than $2&nbsp;million. In 2002, when she was 17 years old, Lavigne entered the music industry with her debut album, ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'', becoming one of the most popular pop punk artists, a reason she earned her reputation of a "[[Skate punk|skater punk]]" persona and "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|pop punk princess]]"{{r|altman|observer}}. Since her professional debut, she has sold more than 30 million albums and over 50 million singles worldwide.{{r|billboard-april2013}}

''Let Go'' made Lavigne the youngest female soloist to reach number 1 in the UK. As of 2013, it has sold nearly 7 million copies in the United States and over 16 million copies worldwide.{{r|billboard 2013-04-10}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/avril-lavigne-madonna-is-my-idol-1091758|title=Avril Lavigne: Madonna is my idol |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)]]|publisher=Rick Fulton|date=10 January 2011|accessdate=19 December 2012}}</ref> Her breakthrough single, "[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]", peaked at number 1 in many countries around the world, as did the album ''Let Go''. Her second studio album, ''[[Under My Skin (Avril Lavigne album)|Under My Skin]]'', was released in May 2004 and was her first album to peak at number 1 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], eventually selling more than 10 million copies worldwide. ''[[The Best Damn Thing]]'', Lavigne's third album, was released in April 2007, becoming her third number 1 album in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and featuring her first US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number 1 single, "[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]]".

Lavigne is one of the top-selling artists releasing albums in the US, with over 11 million copies certified by the RIAA. Her fourth studio album, ''[[Goodbye Lullaby]]'', was released in March 2011. ''Goodbye Lullaby'' gave Lavigne her fourth top 10 album on the US ''Billboard'' 200 and the UK Albums Chart and her third number 1 album in both Japan and Australia. Three months after the release of ''Goodbye Lullaby'', Lavigne began work on her [[Avril Lavigne (album)|eponymously titled fifth studio album]], which was released by [[Epic Records]] on 1 November 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walmart.com/ip/27159054 |title=Rock N' Roll (Walmart Exclusive), Avril Lavigne: Pop |publisher=Walmart.com |date=27 August 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref>{{r|chestang|cornerfifth}} following her departure from [[RCA Records]] in 2011.

Lavigne took a break from recording music, pursuing careers in feature film acting and designing clothes and perfumes. She voiced Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]], in the animated film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'' in 2006. That same year, she made her on-screen feature film debut in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]''. In 2008, Lavigne introduced her clothing line, [[Abbey Dawn]], and in 2009 she released her first perfume, [[Black Star (fragrance)|Black Star]], which was followed by her second perfume, [[Forbidden Rose]], in 2010 and her third perfume, Wild Rose, in 2011. In July 2006, Lavigne married her boyfriend of two years, [[Deryck Whibley]], lead singer and guitarist for [[Sum 41]]. The marriage lasted four years. In October 2009, Lavigne filed for [[divorce]]. Whibley and Lavigne continued to work together, with Whibley producing her fourth album, as well as Lavigne's single "[[Alice (Avril Lavigne song)|Alice]]", written for [[Tim Burton]]'s film ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. Lavigne married [[Nickelback]] frontman [[Chad Kroeger]] in 2013.

==Early life and education==
Lavigne was born in [[Belleville, Ontario]], Canada. Her mother is of English, Scottish, and German descent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethnicelebs.com/avril-lavigne |title=Avril Lavigne|accessdate=27 December 2007}}</ref> and her father, Jean-Claude Joseph Lavigne, is of [[French-Canadian]] extraction, and Avril holds a French passport.{{r|wennfrance}} She was named "Avril" by her father{{r|storage.canoe.ca}} after the French word for the month of April. He and Lavigne's mother, Judy,{{r|rollingstonecover}} recognized their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang "[[Jesus Loves Me]]" on the way home from church.{{r|sperling}} Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle,{{r|peoplekappes}} both of whom teased her when she sang. "My brother used to knock on the wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying."{{r|sperling}}

When Lavigne was five years old, the family moved to [[Greater Napanee]], Ontario,{{r|unofficialbiog}} a town with a population of approximately 5,000.{{r|canoemcqueen|mtvrealdeal|ewwillman}}  As a child, she was sometimes kicked out of class for misbehaving, her parents supported her singing. Her father bought her a microphone, a drum kit, a keyboard, and several guitars, and converted their basement into a studio; following his own love for music Jean-Claude led the family to church at Third Day Worship Center in [[Kingston, Ontario]], where he often played bass. When Lavigne was 14 years old, her parents took her to karaoke sessions.{{r|msnbcpauley}} Lavigne also performed at country fairs, singing songs by [[Garth Brooks]], the [[Dixie Chicks]], and [[Shania Twain]]. She also began writing her own songs. Her first song was called "Can't Stop Thinking About You", about a teenage crush, which she described as "cheesy cute".{{r|mirrorquigley}}

==Music career==

===1999–2001: Early performances and record deal===
In 1999, Lavigne won a radio contest to perform with the Canadian singer [[Shania Twain]] at the [[Canadian Tire Centre|Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, before an audience of 20,000 people.{{r|tracy}}{{r|unofficialbiog|canoemcqueen}} Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, "[[What Made You Say That]]",{{r|unofficialbiog}} and Lavigne told Twain that she was going to be "a famous singer".{{r|canoemcqueen}} During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger  Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, "Touch the Sky", for his 1999 album, ''Quinte Spirit''. She later sang on "Temple of Life" and "Two Rivers" for his follow-up album, ''My Window to You'', in 2000.

In December 1999, Lavigne was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing [[country music|country]] covers at a [[Chapters]] bookstore in [[Kingston, Ontario]].{{r|unofficialbiog|canoemcqueen}} Fabri sent out VHS tapes of Lavigne's home performances to several industry prospects, and Lavigne was visited by several executives.{{r|sk8terfaker}} Mark Jowett, co-founder of a Canadian management firm, [[Nettwerk]], received a copy of Lavigne's karaoke performances recorded in her parents' basement.{{r|patch}} Jowett arranged for Lavigne to work with producer [[Peter Zizzo]] during the summer of 2000 in New York, where she wrote the song "Why". Lavigne was noticed by [[Arista Records]] during a trip to New York.{{r|sk8terfaker}}

In November 2000,{{r|mtvrealdeal}} Ken Krongard, an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] representative, invited [[L.A. Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]], then head of Arista Records, to Zizzo's Manhattan studio to hear Lavigne sing. Her 15-minute audition "so impressed" Reid that he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25&nbsp;million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance.{{r|ewwillman|unofficialbiog}} By this time, Lavigne had found that she fit in naturally with her hometown high school's skater clique, an image that carried through to her first album, but although she enjoyed [[skateboard]]ing, school left her feeling insecure. Having signed a record deal, and with support from her parents, she left school to focus on her music career.{{r|mtvrealdeal}}{{r|canadianpress|mirrorquigley}} Lavigne's band was chosen by Nettwerk, as they wanted young performers who were up and coming from the [[Canadian punk rock]] scene who would fit with Lavigne's personality.<ref>http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Lavigne-Avril.html Most inexperienced singers are backed by seasoned musicians, but Nettwerk chose to go with young performers who were up and coming in the Canadian punk-rock scene. As Nettwerk manager Shauna Gold told Shanda Deziel of Maclean's, "[Lavigne] is young, her music's young, we needed a band that would fit well with who she is as a person."</ref>

===2002–03: ''Let Go''===
[[File:AvrilShow.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|Lavigne performing in [[Toronto]], Canada in September 2002]]
Reid gave A&R Joshua Sarubin the responsibility of overseeing Lavigne's development and the recording of her debut album. They spent several months in New York working with different co-writers, trying to forge an individual sound for her. Sarubin told [[HitQuarters]] that they initially struggled; although early collaborations with songwriter-producers including Sabelle Breer, Curt Frasca and Peter Zizzo resulted in some good songs, they did not match her or her voice. It was only when Lavigne then went to Los Angeles in May 2001 and created two songs with [[The Matrix (production team)|The Matrix]] production team&mdash;including "[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]", later released as her debut single&mdash;that the record company felt she had made a major breakthrough. Lavigne worked further with The Matrix and also with singer-songwriter Cliff Magness. Recording of Lavigne's debut album, ''[[Let Go (Avril Lavigne album)|Let Go]]'', finished in January 2002.{{r|hitquarters}}

Lavigne released ''Let Go'' in June 2002 in the US, where it reached number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. It peaked at number one in Australia, Canada, and the UK&mdash;this made Lavigne, at 17 years old, the youngest female soloist to have a number-one album on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at that time.{{r|aboutlamb}} By the end of 2002, the album was certified four-times platinum by the RIAA, making her the bestselling female artist of 2002 and ''Let Go'' the top-selling debut of the year.{{r|riaadiamond}} By May 2003, ''Let Go'' had accumulated over 1,000,000 sales in Canada, receiving a diamond certification from the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]].{{r|criadiamond}} By 2009, the album had sold over 16 million units worldwide,{{r|transworldnews}} and the RIAA certified the album six-times platinum, denoting shipments of over six million units in the US (it has sold 6.8 million copies, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]]<ref name=Billboard-July2013>http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/1569263/ask-billboard-why-do-some-songs-fade-out-and-others-end-cold?page=0%2C3</ref>).{{r|riaalavigne}}

Lavigne's debut single, "Complicated", peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the US. "Complicated" was one of the bestselling Canadian singles of 2002, and one of the decade's biggest hits in the US,{{r|billboarddecadehot100}} where subsequent singles "[[Sk8er Boi]]" and "[[I'm with You (song)|I'm with You]]" reached the top ten.{{r|billboardcharthistory}} With these three singles, Lavigne became the second artist in history to have three number-one songs from a debut album on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart.{{r|reuterstop40}} Lavigne was named [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] (for "Complicated") at the [[2002 MTV Video Music Awards]],{{r|thestarmtv}} won four [[Juno Awards]] in 2003 out of six nominations,{{r|billboardjuno}} received a [[World Music Awards|World Music Award]] for "World's Bestselling Canadian Singer", and was nominated for eight [[Grammy Award]]s, including [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for "Complicated".{{r|hollywoodgrammy}}

In 2002, Lavigne made a cameo appearance in the music video for "[[Hundred Million]]" by the [[pop punk]] band [[Treble Charger]].{{r|cbcnewstreble}} In March 2003, Lavigne posed for the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine,{{r|rollingstonecover}} and in May she performed "[[Fuel (song)|Fuel]]" during MTV's Icon tribute to [[Metallica]].{{r|mtvdowney}}{{r|mtviconmetallica}} During her first headlining tour, the Try to Shut Me Up Tour, Lavigne covered [[Green Day]]'s "[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]".{{r|sfgatesullivan}}

Themes in Lavigne's music include messages of self-empowerment from a female or an adolescent view.{{r|blossoming}} Lavigne believes her "songs are about being yourself no matter what and going after your dreams even if your dreams are crazy and even if people tell you they're never going to come true."{{r|girlauinterview}} On her debut album, ''Let Go'', Lavigne preferred the  less mainstream songs, such as "[[Losing Grip]]", instead of her more radio-friendly singles, such as "[[Complicated (Avril Lavigne song)|Complicated]]", saying that "the songs I did with [[The Matrix (record production team)|the Matrix]]&nbsp;... were good for my first record, but I don't want to be that pop anymore."{{r|teenspirit}} Lavigne's second album, ''Under My Skin'', had deeper personal themes underlying each song, saying that "I've gone through so much, so that's what I talk about&nbsp;... Like boys, like dating or relationships".{{r|musicomhinterview}} In contrast, her third album, ''The Best Damn Thing'', was not personal to her. "Some of the songs I wrote didn't even mean that much to me. It's not like some personal thing I'm going through."{{r|scold}} Her objective in writing the album was simply to "make it fun".{{r|salva}} ''Goodbye Lullaby'', Lavigne's fourth album, was much more personal than her earlier records,{{r|musicmix}} with Lavigne describing the album as "more stripped down, deeper. All the songs are very emotional".{{r|popeater}} [[Ian McKellen]] defined her as "a punk chanteuse, a post-grunge valkyrie, with the wounded soul of a poet and the explosive pugnacity of a Canadian" on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' in 2007.{{r|www.fanpop.com|avrillavigneuk.tumblr.com}}

{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote="I know my fans look up to me and that's why I make my songs so personal; it's all about things I've experienced and things I like or hate. I write for myself and hope that my fans like what I have to say. – Avril Lavigne{{r|girlauinterview}}
}}
Most critics and publications, such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[NME]]'', ''[[MusicMight]]'', [[IGN]] and ''[[PopMatters]]'', have identified Lavigne as a mix of [[alternative rock]], [[pop rock]] and [[pop punk]],{{r|www.musicmight.com|music.ign.com|www.popmatters.com|www.nytimes.com|www.rollingstone.com|www.rollingstone.com-2}} influenced by a [[post-grunge]] sound.{{r|www.thebiographychannel.co.uk|www.allmusic.com|www.allrovi.com|www.musicmight.com|www.fanpop.com-2}}<ref>http://www.hotpress.com/Avril-Lavigne/music/interviews/Girl-youll-be-a-woman-soon/2766884.html "With her tom boy togs, text-friendly titles and '''slick distillation of pop, grunge, punk, country and power ballads, Avril Lavigne is the (current) apotheosis of this trend'''."</ref>

While Lavigne denied being angry, her interviews were still passionate about the media's lack of respect for her songwriting. She said "I am a writer, and I won't accept people trying to take that away from me", adding that she had been writing "full-structured songs" since she was 14.{{r|ledgermoody}} Despite this, Lavigne's songwriting has been questioned throughout her career. The songwriting trio the Matrix, with whom Lavigne wrote songs for her debut album, claimed that they were the main songwriters of Lavigne's singles "Complicated", "[[Sk8er Boi]]" and "[[I'm with You (song)|I'm with You]]". Lavigne denied this, asserting that she was the primary songwriter for every song on the album, saying that "[N]one of those songs aren't from me".{{r|teenspirit}} In 2007, [[Chantal Kreviazuk]], who wrote with Lavigne on her second album, accused Lavigne of plagiarism{{r|kreviazuk}} and criticized her songwriting, saying that "Avril doesn't really sit and write songs by herself or anything."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Lavigne also disclaimed this, and considered taking legal action against Kreviazuk for "clear defamation" against her character.{{r|yahoomusic}} Kreviazuk later apologized, saying that "Avril is an accomplished songwriter and it has been my privilege to work with her."{{r|kreviazuk}} Shortly after that, Tommy Dunbar, founder of the band [[the Rubinoos]], sued Lavigne, her publishing company, and [[Dr. Luke|Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald]] for allegedly stealing parts of "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend" for her song "Girlfriend".{{r|billboardstole}} Gottwald defended Lavigne, stating, "me and Avril wrote the song together... It has the same chord progressions as ten different Blink-182 songs, the standard changes you'd find in a [[Sum 41]] song. It's the [[Sex Pistols]], not the Rubinoos."{{r|yahoomusic}} In January 2008, the lawsuit was closed after a confidential settlement had been reached.{{r|settle}}

===Influences===
Lavigne's earlier influences came from [[country music]] acts such as [[Garth Brooks]], [[the Dixie Chicks]] and [[Shania Twain]];{{r|teenspirit|mirrorquigley}} and [[alternative music|alternative]] [[singer-songwriter]]s such as [[Alanis Morissette]], [[Lisa Loeb]], [[Natalie Imbruglia]] and [[Janis Joplin]].{{r|musicomhinterview}} By the time she left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by [[pop punk]] and [[punk rock]] acts such as [[blink-182]], [[Sum 41]], [[Green Day]], [[the Ramones]], [[the Distillers]] and [[Hole (band)|Hole]]. She also enjoyed [[metal music|metal]] bands such as [[Marilyn Manson]], [[System of a Down]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] and [[the Used]]; as well as [[alternative rock|alternative]] bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[No Doubt]], [[Goo Goo Dolls]], [[Radiohead]], [[Coldplay]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Third Eye Blind]] and [[Matchbox Twenty]].{{r|capricho.abril.com.br}}<ref>https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/avril_lavigne_when_females_lash_out.html "what music she listens to then, she [Avril] said: "Marilyn Manson, The Used, Hole, Radiohead, The Distillers, NOFX etc"</ref><ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/influences-avril-lavigne-mw0001588701 Influences: Avril Lavigne</ref><ref>http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/avril-lavigne-20040624 "I've been listening to Third Eye Blind, Oasis, Marilyn Manson and System of a Down on my iPod, but I really like the new Blink-182 record."k</ref><ref>http://www.mtv.com/artists/avril-lavigne/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy Artist Influences for Avril Lavigne</ref><ref>http://www.hotpress.com/Avril-Lavigne/features/interviews/4-real/2651650.html ""I listen to… I’ve been listening to a lot of older stuff latelyish", she murmurs tentatively. "I bought a bunch of CDs… Like… I mean… (pause) The newer stuff I listen to is Green Day, System Of A Down… (claps hands) I dunno. I’m all over the place. At the moment I’m into The Distillers… Hole… I like Alanis…"<br>Female frontpeople like Courtney Love and Alanis Morrissette must have been a huge deal for you when you were younger, we suggest.<br>
"Well, I didn’t start listening to Hole until recently," says Avril, "so y’know, I only recently really know who she is, but I listened to Alanis quite a lot. She was really inspiring."</ref>

Because of these influences, musical genres, and Lavigne's personal style, the media often defined her as [[punk subculture|punk]], something she denied being. Lavigne's close friend and guitarist, [[Evan Taubenfeld]], said, "It's a very touchy subject to a lot of people, but the point is that Avril isn't punk, but she never really pretended to claim to come from that scene. She had pop punk music and the media ended up doing the rest".{{r|ultimateguitar}} Lavigne also commented on the matter: "I have been labeled like I'm this angry girl, [a] rebel&nbsp;... punk, and I am ''so'' not any of them."{{r|ledgermoody}} Although she stated to have punk influences on her music: "I like to listen a lot to punk rock music, you can notice a certain influence of punk in my music. I like an aggressive music, but pretty enough pop-rock, which is what I really do."{{r|capricho.abril.com.br}}

==Other work==

===Film career===
Lavigne became interested in appearing on television and in feature films. The decision, she said, was her own. Although her years of experience in making music videos was to her advantage, Lavigne admitted her experience in singing removed any fear of performing on camera. She specifically mentioned that the video "Nobody's Home" involved the most "acting".{{r|girlauinterview}} Her first television appearance was in a 2002 episode of ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'',{{r|sabrinateenagewitch}} performing "Sk8er Boi"{{r|mtvsabrinanov}} with her band in a nightclub.{{r|mtvsabrinaaug}} She later made a cameo appearance in the 2004 film ''[[Going the Distance (2004 film)|Going the Distance]]''. The main characters bump into her backstage at the [[MuchMusic Video Awards]]{{r|canoedistance}} after her performance of "Losing Grip".{{r|goingthedistance}}

[[File:Avrilgfdl.JPG|thumb|right|Lavigne at the [[2006 Cannes Film Festival]] ]]

She moved into feature film acting cautiously, choosing deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, after going through an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to [[New Mexico]]{{r|mtvflock}} to film a single scene in the 2007 film, ''[[The Flock (film)|The Flock]]''.{{r|digitalspyflock}} She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside [[Claire Danes]] and [[Richard Gere]]. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes.{{r|digitalspyflock}} On her role in ''The Flock'', Lavigne said, "I did that just to see how it was and to not jump into [mainstream acting] too fast".{{r|girlauinterview}} ''The Flock'' was not released in American theatres, and because it was not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7&nbsp;million in the foreign box office.{{r|mojoflock}}

Lavigne's feature film debut was voicing an animated character in the 2006 film ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]'', based on the [[Over the Hedge|comic strip of the same name]]. She voiced the character Heather, a [[Virginia opossum]]. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, "All the actors went in individually, and [director] [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim]] and [screenwriter [[Karey Kirkpatrick|Karey]]] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with no one else to kind of feed off of."{{r|cctvhedge}} Lavigne found the recording process to be "easy" and "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as she gestured while acting. "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. "[The director] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude".{{r|girlauinterview}} The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38&nbsp;million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojohedge}}

In December 2005, Lavigne signed to appear in ''[[Fast Food Nation (film)|Fast Food Nation]]'', based on the book ''[[Fast Food Nation|Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal]]''.{{r|contactmusicfastfood}} The fictionalized adaptation, directed by [[Richard Linklater]], traces fast-food hamburgers contaminated with cow feces back to the slaughterhouses.{{r|washingtonpostfastfood}} Lavigne played Alice, a high school student intent on freeing the cows.{{r|msnbcfastfood}}{{r|nytimesfastfood}} The film opened on 17 November 2006 and remained in theatres for 11 weeks, grossing $2&nbsp;million worldwide.{{r|mojofastfood}}

Both ''Over the Hedge'' and ''Fast Food Nation'' opened at the 2006 [[Cannes Film Festival]], which Lavigne attended. Lavigne felt honoured to be able to attend and was proud of her work. When asked if she would pursue her film career, she stated that she wanted to take her time and wait for the "right parts and the right movies." Lavigne was aware of the roles she had chosen. "I wanted to start off small and to learn [that] I wouldn't just want to throw myself into a big part."{{r|girlauinterview}} In August 2006, ''[[Canadian Business]]'' magazine ranked her as the seventh top Canadian actor in Hollywood in their second-annual ranking Celebrity Power List. The results were determined by comparing salary, Internet hits, TV mentions, and press hits.{{r|canadianbusiness}}

===Fashion design===
In July 2008, Lavigne launched the clothing line ''[[Abbey Dawn]]'', featuring a back-to-school collection. It is produced by [[Kohl's]], which is the brand's exclusive US retailer. Named after Lavigne's childhood nickname, Abbey Dawn is designed by Lavigne herself.{{r|warechok|venaabbey}} Kohl's describes Abbey Dawn as a "juniors lifestyle brand",{{r|kohls}} which incorporates skull, zebra, and star patterns, purples and "hot pinks and blacks". Lavigne, who wore some of the clothes and jewellery from her line at various concerts before its official launch, pointed out that she was not merely licensing her name to the collection. "I actually am the designer. What's really important to me is that everything fits well and is well-made, so I try everything on and approve it all."{{r|usatodaybarker}} The clothing line incorporates Lavigne's musical style and lyrics, "after the release of my first album, I realized how much fashion was involved in my musical career".{{r|abbeyhuffington}}

The designs were also featured on the Internet game ''[[Stardoll]]'', where figures can be dressed up as Lavigne.{{r|nprmouse}} On 14 September 2009, Lavigne took her then latest collection for her clothing line to be a part of the [[New York Fashion Week]],{{r|newyorkabbey}} returning in 2011.{{r|abbeyhuffington}} In December 2010, the clothing line was made available to over 50 countries through the line's official website.{{r|artistdirectrelease|popeater}} "It's fun to be a chick and design clothes and things I'd like for myself. I design things I [can't] find."{{r|inked2010}}

Lavigne released her first fragrance, ''[[Black Star (fragrance)|Black Star]]'', created by [[Procter & Gamble]] Prestige Products. The fragrance was announced on Lavigne's official website on 7 March 2009. Black Star, which features notes of pink hibiscus, black plum and dark chocolate, was released in summer 2009 in Europe, and later in the US and Canada.{{r|basenotes}} When asked what the name meant, Lavigne replied, "I wanted [the bottle] to be a star, and my colors are pink and black, and Black Star resembles being different, and standing out in the crowd, and reaching for the stars; the whole message is just about following your dreams, and it's okay to be unique and be who you are."{{r|seacrestinterview6may}} Black Star won the 2010 Best "Women's Scent Mass" by Cosmetic Executive Women (CEW).{{r|cewblackstar}} Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010, ''[[Forbidden Rose]]'', which took two years to develop.{{r|2dayfm}} It features notes of red apple, winepeach, black pepper, lotusflower, heliotrope, shellflower, praline agreement, sandalwood, and vanilla.{{r|independentrose}} Its message is an extension of Black Star's "follow your dreams",{{r|perfumeblog}} though the tagline for the new perfume is "Dare to Discover".{{r|rosecommercial}} The commercial takes place in a [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] garden setting,{{r|perfumeblog}} where Lavigne, upon entering the garden, finds a single, purple rose.{{r|rosecommercial}} Lavigne launched a third fragrance, Wild Rose, in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010.{{r|popeater}} The tagline for the fragrance is "Dare to discover more".{{r|perfumediary}} It features notes of mandarin, pink grapefruit, plum, orange blossom, frangipani, blue orchid, musk, sandalwood and crème brûlée.{{r|fragrantica}}

In January 2010, Lavigne began working with Disney to incorporate ''Alice in Wonderland''-inspired designs into her Abbey Dawn line of clothing.{{r|seacrestinterview26}} Her designs were exhibited at the [[Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising]] in California beginning in May through September, alongside [[Colleen Atwood]]'s costumes from the 2010 film.{{r|ladowntownalice}}

Lavigne has been involved with many charities, including [[Make Some Noise (campaign)|Make Some Noise, Amnesty International]], Erase MS, AmericanCPR.org, [[Special Olympics]], Camp Will-a-Way, Music Clearing Minefields, [[US Campaign for Burma]], [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] and [[War Child (charity)|War Child]]. She has also appeared in [[Aldo Group|ALDO]] ads with YouthAIDS to raise money to educate people worldwide about HIV/AIDS. Lavigne took part in the Unite Against AIDS concert presented by ALDO in support of UNICEF on 28 November 2007 at the [[Bell Centre]] in Montréal, Québec, Canada.{{r|gazettedunlevy}} In November 2010, Lavigne attended the [[Clinton Global Initiative]].{{r|celebphil}}

Lavigne worked with [[Reverb (non-profit)|Reverb]], a non-profit environmental organization, for her 2005 east coast tour.{{r|concordiensis}} She covered "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]" for War Child's ''Peace Songs'' compilation, and she recorded a cover of the [[John Lennon]] song "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" as her contribution to the compilation album ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]''. Released on 12 June 2007, the album was produced to benefit [[Amnesty International]]'s campaign to alleviate the [[Darfur conflict|crisis in Darfur]].{{r|amnestydarfur}}

On 5 December 2009, Lavigne returned to the stage in [[Mexico City]] during the biggest charity event in Latin America, "[[Teletón (Mexico)|Teleton]]". She performed acoustic versions of her hits "Complicated" and "Girlfriend" with Evan Taubenfeld and band member, [[Jim McGorman]].{{r|siglotorreon}} In 2010, Lavigne was one of [[Young Artists for Haiti|several artists]] who contributed their voices to a cover of [[K'naan]]'s "Wavin' Flag" as a benefit single to help raise money for several charity organizations related to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]].{{r|celebri}}

On 14 September 2010, Lavigne introduced her charity, "The Avril Lavigne Foundation", which aims to help young people with serious illnesses and disabilities{{r|celebphil|musicmixqa}} and works with leading charitable organizations;{{r|artistdirectrelease}} The foundation partners with the [[Easter Seals (U.S.)|Easter Seals]], Make-A-Wish foundation and Erase MS,{{r|partners}} the latter two being charities Lavigne has previously worked with. Her work with the Make-A-Wish foundation was the inspiration behind her own charity, with Lavigne stating, "I just really wanted to do more".{{r|musicmixqa}} Lavigne said on the foundation's website, "I have always looked for ways to give back because I think it's a responsibility we all share".{{r|foundation}} Philanthropist [[Trevor Neilson]]'s 12-person firm, "[[Global Philanthropy Group]]", advises Lavigne with her foundation as well as several other celebrities, including musician [[John Legend]].{{r|celebphil}}

In September 2014, she launched a personal fundraising campaign for [[Special Olympics]] as part of her birthday celebration. Proceeds from her "Team Rockstar" event helped sponsor athletes from around the world competing in the 2015 Special Olympics World Summer Games in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theavrillavignefoundation.org/users/WUhW2ZGM/blogs/5994321|title=Birthday Campaign!: The Avril Lavigne Foundation|work=theavrillavignefoundation.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.specialolympics.org/Stories/General/Avril_Lavigne_Fundraiser_Supports_Special_Olympics.aspx|title=Special Olympics: Avril Lavigne Fundraiser Supports Special Olympics|work=specialolympics.org}}</ref> According to an [[ABILITY Magazine]] interview with Lavigne, the athletes were the stars of the music video for "Fly", which was shot in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abilitymagazine.com/avril-lavigne.html |title=Avril Lavigne — Fly High with Special Olympics |date=1 June 2015 |website=ABILITYMagazine.com |publisher=ABILITY Magazine |access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref>

===Other projects===
Lavigne was featured in the 2003 game ''[[The Sims: Superstar]]'' as a [[non-playable character|non-playable celebrity]].{{r|gamingexcellence}}

In mid-2007, Lavigne was featured in a two-volume [[graphic novel]], ''[[Avril Lavigne's Make 5 Wishes]]''. She collaborated with artist [[Camilla d'Errico]] and writer [[Joshua Dysart]] on the manga, which was about a shy girl named Hana who, upon meeting her hero, Lavigne, learned to overcome her fears. Lavigne said, "I know that many of my fans read manga, and I'm really excited to be involved in creating stories that I know they will enjoy." The first volume was released in April 2007, and the second followed in July 2007. The publication ''[[Young Adult Library Services]]'' nominated the series for "Great Graphic Novels for Teens".{{r|randomhouse}}

In September 2011, Lavigne appeared on the [[Hub Network]] televised singing competition ''[[Majors & Minors]]'' as a guest mentor, alongside other singers including [[Adam Lambert]] and [[Leona Lewis]].{{r|abbeyhuffington}}

{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote="I have to fight to keep my image really ''me''&nbsp;... I rejected some gorgeous publicity shots because they just didn't look like me. I won't wear skanky clothes that show my booty, my belly or my boobs. I have a great body." – Avril Lavigne{{r|mtvrealdeal}}
}}
When Lavigne first gained publicity, she was known for her [[tomboy]]ish style,{{r|vancouversun}} in particular her necktie-and-tank-top combinations.{{r|nytimesnecktie|wakeupvideo}} She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or [[Converse (shoe company)|Converses]],{{r|inked2010}} wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers.{{r|msnbcpauley}} During photo shoots, instead of wearing "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing "old, crumpled T's".{{r|mtvrealdeal}} In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|pop punk princess]]"{{r|altman|observer}} and the female answer to [[Blink-182]].<ref>http://www.complex.com/girls/2011/01/the-11-hottest-comeback-chicks-of-2011/avril-lavigne "Lavigne somehow devolved into that sk8r girl who was only relevant to the mid-2000s pop punk period as the female answer to Blink 182"</ref> Press and fans regarded her as the [[Britney Spears|"anti-Britney"]], in part because of her less commercial and "real" image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. "I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not."{{r|msnbcpauley}} By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was "wearing a costume".{{r|ewwillman}} Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. "I'm just saying, I don't want to sell sex. I feel that's sort of lame and low. I've got so much more to say."{{r|manilamoody}}

Lavigne eventually took on a more [[goth subculture|gothic]] style as she began her second album, ''Under My Skin'', trading her skating outfits for black [[Ballet tutu|tutus]]{{r|observer}} and developing an image marked by [[angst]].{{r|mtvundermyskin}} During ''The Best Damn Thing'' years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits,{{r|imnotobsessed}} including "tight jeans and heels",{{r|inked2010}} and modelled for magazines such as ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]''.{{r|vancouversun}} Lavigne defended her new style: "I don't really regret anything. You know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all&nbsp;... It had its time and place. And now I'm all grown up, and I've moved on".{{r|imnotobsessed}}

===Tattoos===
{{Quote box|width=30em|align=right|quote=Everything is always spur-of-the-moment. All of my tattoos, I decide that second and do it. – Avril Lavigne{{r|inked2010}}
}}

Only a few of Lavigne's tattoos are unique to her; the rest are matched with those of her friends.{{r|inked2010}} Lavigne had a star tattooed on the inside of her left wrist that was created at the same time as friend and musical associate [[Ben Moody]]'s identical tattoo.{{r|mtvaction}} In late 2004, she had a small pink heart around the letter "D" applied to her right wrist, which represented her then-boyfriend, Deryck Whibley.{{r|inked2010|ferguson2007}} Lavigne and then-husband Whibley got matching tattoos in March 2010, in celebration of his 30th birthday.{{r|inked2010}} In April 2010, Lavigne added another tattoo on her wrist, that of a lightning bolt and the number 30.{{r|dose}}

[[File:Avril Lavigne leaning, St. Petersburg (crop).jpg|thumb|left|Lavigne's XXV and star tattoos on her right forearm, and 30, lightning bolt, and star tattoos on her left wrist]]
Her love of tattoos, however, gained media attention in May 2010, after Lavigne and [[Brody Jenner]] each got matching tattoos of the word "fuck" on their ribs.{{r|radaronlinetattoo|usweeklytattoo}} Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for [[Inked (magazine)|''Inked'' magazine]], where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an "Abbey Dawn" on her left forearm and an "XXV" and star on her right. Although she confirmed the "fuck" tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her "favorite word"{{r|inked2010}}) she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot.{{r|inkedblog}} She added that she eventually wanted to get a "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name&nbsp;... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait for that special someone to come back into my life."{{r|inked2010}} In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast.{{r|mtvbrodytattoo}} The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.{{r|www.eonline.com}}

===Relationships===

====Deryck Whibley====
Lavigne and [[Sum 41]] lead vocalist/rhythm guitarist [[Deryck Whibley]] began dating when Lavigne was 19 years old, after being friends since she was 17.{{r|okmetcalfe}} Only a few weeks before they met, Lavigne admitted that she was not meeting boys because her bodyguards were frightening them away. In June 2005, Whibley surprised Lavigne with a trip to [[Venice]], Italy, including a [[gondola]] ride and a romantic picnic, and on 27 June, he proposed to her.{{r|askmen}}

She at first wanted to have a "rock n' roll, goth wedding", but admitted that she had doubts about going against tradition. "I've been dreaming about my wedding day since I was a little girl. I have to wear the white dress&nbsp;... people thought that I would [wear a] black wedding dress, and I would have. But at the same time, I was thinking about the wedding pictures, and I wanted to be in style. I didn't want to be thinking, 20 years later, 'Oh, why did I wear my hair like that?'"{{r|gothwedding}} The couple married on 15 July 2006 in [[Montecito, California]].

Seven months into their marriage, Lavigne stated that she was "the best thing that's ever happened to him", and suggested that she helped Whibley stay off drugs since they had begun dating.
