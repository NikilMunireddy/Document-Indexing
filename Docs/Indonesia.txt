The world's [[List of islands by population|most populous island]] of [[Java]] contains more than half of the country's population.

Indonesia's republican form of government includes an elected legislature and president. Indonesia has [[Provinces of Indonesia|34 provinces]], of which five have Special Administrative status. Its capital city is [[Jakarta]]. The country shares land borders with [[Papua New Guinea]], [[East Timor]], and [[Malaysia]]. Other neighbouring countries include [[Singapore]], the [[Philippines]], [[Australia–Indonesia border|Australia]], [[Palau]], and the [[India]]n territory of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. Indonesia is a founding member of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] and a member of the [[G-20 major economies]]. The [[Economy of Indonesia|Indonesian economy]] is the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|16th]] largest by nominal GDP and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|8th]] largest by GDP at [[purchasing power parity|PPP]].

The Indonesian archipelago has been an important trade region since at least the 7th century, when [[Srivijaya]] and then later [[Majapahit]] traded with [[China]] and [[India]]. Local rulers gradually absorbed foreign cultural, religious and political models from the early [[Century|centuries]] [[Common Era|CE]], and [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]] and [[Buddhism in Southeast Asia|Buddhist]] kingdoms flourished. [[History of Indonesia|Indonesian history]] has been influenced by foreign powers drawn to its natural resources. [[Muslim]] traders and [[Sufism|Sufi]] scholars brought the now-dominant [[Islam in Southeast Asia|Islam]],<ref>[https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=Ma38W_8unrUC&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=sufi+traders+indonesia&source=bl&ots=31NBw-8x6B&sig=797Iiya69_mj3XWSQ1eQ8mMrXgw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBmoVChMI3KPr45-UyQIVQpUsCh0GGgZf#v=onepage&q=sufi%20traders%20indonesia&f=false Islam in Indonesia: Contrasting Images and Interpretations]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=nr3DuQKDfRYC&pg=PT34&lpg=PT34&dq=sufi+traders+indonesia&source=bl&ots=bu86OzaZ9e&sig=Bea-1G2IhqzANDJBIM1o0Qz1rg4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFAQ6AEwB2oVChMI3KPr45-UyQIVQpUsCh0GGgZf#v=onepage&q=sufi%20traders%20indonesia&f=false Indonesia: A Global Studies Handbook]</ref> while European powers brought Christianity and fought one another to monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] during the [[Age of Discovery]]. Following three and a half centuries of [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonialism]] starting from the East Indonesia of [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], [[Timor]] to eventually all of West Indonesia, at times interrupted by [[Portuguese colonialism in Indonesia|Portuguese]], [[French and British interludes in the Dutch East Indies|French and British]] rule, Indonesia [[Indonesian National Revolution|secured its independence]] after [[World War II]]. Indonesia's history has since been turbulent, with challenges posed by natural disasters, [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|mass slaughter]], [[Corruption in Indonesia|corruption]], [[List of active separatist movements in Asia#Indonesia|separatism]], [[Post-Suharto era|a democratisation process]], and periods of rapid economic change.

Indonesia consists of hundreds of distinct native [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|ethnic]] and [[Languages of Indonesia|linguistic groups]]. The largest – and politically dominant – ethnic group are the [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. A shared [[national identity|identity]] has developed, defined by a [[national language]], ethnic diversity, religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of colonialism and rebellion against it. Indonesia's national motto, ''"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika"'' ("Unity in Diversity" ''literally,'' "many, yet one"), articulates the diversity that shapes the country. Despite its large population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support the world's second highest level of [[biodiversity]]. The country has abundant natural resources like [[oil]] and [[natural gas]], [[tin]], [[copper]] and [[gold]]. Agriculture mainly produces [[rice]], [[tea]], [[coffee]], [[spice]]s and [[Natural rubber|rubber]]. Indonesia's major trading partners are [[Japan]], the [[United States]] and the surrounding nations of [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Australia]].

{{further|Names of Indonesia}}

The first Indonesian scholar to use the name was [[Ki Hajar Dewantara|Suwardi Suryaningrat]] (Ki Hajar Dewantara), when he established a press bureau in the Netherlands with the name ''Indonesisch Pers-bureau'' in 1913.<ref name="indoety"/>

Although Muslim traders first traveled through Southeast Asia early in the Islamic era, the [[Spread of Islam in Indonesia|earliest evidence of Islamized populations]] in Indonesia dates to the 13th century in northern [[Sumatra]].<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pp. 3–14</ref> Other Indonesian areas gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pp. 12-14</ref>

[[Portuguese colonialism in Indonesia|The first regular contact between Europeans and the peoples of Indonesia]] began in 1512, when Portuguese traders led by [[Francisco Serrão]], sought to monopolize the sources of [[nutmeg]], [[clove]]s, and [[cubeb|cubeb pepper]] in Maluku.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), pp. 22-24</ref> Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the Dutch established the [[Dutch East India Company in Indonesia|Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), and in following decades, the Dutch has gained foothold in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] and [[Governorate of Ambon|Amboina]]. Throughout 17th and 18th centuries, the Company became the dominant European power in the archipelago.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://european-heritage.org/netherlands/alkmaar/dutch-east-india-company | title = The dutch east india company | work = European Heritage Project}}</ref>

Following bankruptcy, the VOC was formally dissolved in 1800, and the government of the Netherlands established the [[Dutch East Indies]] as a nationalised colony.<ref>[[#Ricklefs|Ricklefs]], p. 24</ref> For most of [[History of Indonesia#Colonial era|the colonial period]], Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous outside of coastal strongholds; only in the early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries.<ref>[[#Schwarz|Schwarz]], pp. 3–4, writes: "Dutch troops were constantly engaged in quelling rebellions both on and off Java.

Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system. As a unitary state, power is concentrated in the central government. Following the [[Fall of Suharto|resignation of President Suharto]] in 1998, Indonesian political and governmental structures have undergone major reforms. Four amendments to the [[Constitution of Indonesia|1945 Constitution of Indonesia]]<ref>In 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001</ref> have revamped the [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[judiciary|judicial]], and [[legislature|legislative]] branches.<ref name="Harijanti2006">{{cite journal |title=Indonesia: General elections test the amended Constitution and the new Constitutional Court |journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law |author1=Susi Dwi Harijanti |author2=Tim Lindsey |volume=4 |issue=1 |year=2006 |pages=138–150 |doi=10.1093/icon/moi055}}</ref>

The [[president of Indonesia]] is the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]], and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The president appoints a council of ministers, who are not required to be elected members of the legislature.

The highest representative body at national level is Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat ([[People's Consultative Assembly]]) or MPR. Its main functions are supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating the president, and formalising broad outlines of state policy.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of Indonesia|Subdivisions of Indonesia}}
Administratively, Indonesia consists of 34 provinces, five of which have special status. Each province has its own legislature and governor. The provinces are subdivided into regencies (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kabupaten]]'') and cities (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kota]]''), which are further subdivided into [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan'' or ''distrik'' in Papua and West Papua), and again into [[administrative village]]s (either ''desa'', ''kelurahan'', ''kampung'', ''nagari'' in West Sumatra, or ''gampong'' in Aceh).

The village is the lowest level of government administration in Indonesia. Furthermore, a village is divided into several community groups (''rukun warga'' (RW)) which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (''rukun tetangga'' (RT)). In Java the ''desa'' (village) is divided further into smaller units called ''dusun'' or ''dukuh'' (hamlets), these units are the same as rukun warga. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, the regencies and cities have become the key administrative units, responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected ''lurah'' or ''kepala desa'' (village chief).

The provinces of [[Aceh]], [[Jakarta]], [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]], and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces. The Acehnese government, for example, has the right to create certain elements of an independent legal system. In 2003, it instituted a form of ''[[sharia]]'' (Islamic law).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Michelle Ann Miller |title=The Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam law: a serious response to Acehnese separatism? |journal=Asian Ethnicity |volume=5 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=333–351 |doi=10.1080/1463136042000259789}}</ref>

Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting Indonesian Republicans during the Indonesian Revolution and its willingness to join Indonesia as a republic.<ref>The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritized for descendants of the [[Sultan of Yogyakarta]] and [[Pakualaman|Paku Alam]], respectively, much like a [[sultanate]].

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in Indonesia}}
[[File:Pinisi Sunda Kelapa.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional wooden [[pinisi]] ship still used in inter-Indonesian islands freight service.]]
Road transport is predominant, with a total system length of 437,759&nbsp;km in 2008. Many cities and towns have some form of transportation for hire available as well such as [[Taxicab|taxis]]. There are usually also bus services of various kinds such as the [[Kopaja]] buses and the more sophisticated [[TransJakarta]] [[bus rapid transit]] system in Jakarta. The TransJakarta is the largest bus rapid transit system in the world, boasts some 194&nbsp;km and carriers more than 300,000 passengers daily.<ref>Guinness World Records 2015</ref> In addition, BRT systems exist in [[Yogyakarta]], [[Palembang]], [[Bandung]], [[Denpasar]], [[Pekanbaru]], [[Semarang]], [[Makassar]], and [[Padang]] without segregated lane. Many cities also have motorised [[auto rickshaw]]s (''[[Bajaj Auto|bajaj]]'') of various kinds. [[Cycle rickshaw]]s, called ''becak'' in Indonesia, are a regular sight on city roads and provide inexpensive transportation.

The [[rail transport]] system has four unconnected networks in [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]] primarily dedicated to transport bulk commodities and long-distance passenger traffic. The [[inter-city rail]] network on Java is complemented by local [[commuter rail]] services in the [[Jabodetabek|Jakarta metropolitan area]] ([[KA Commuter Jabodetabek]]), [[Surabaya]], [[Medan]], and [[Bandung]]. In Jakarta, suburban rail services carry 550,000 passengers a day.<ref>Oxford Business Group, The Report: Indonesia, 2014</ref> In addition, [[Rapid transit|mass rapid transit]] and [[light rail]] transit systems are under construction in Jakarta.

Sea transport is extremely important for economic integration and for domestic and foreign trade. It is well developed, with each of the major islands having at least one significant [[Port|port city]]. Because Indonesia encompasses a sprawling [[archipelago]], [[ship transport|maritime shipping]] provides essential links between different parts of the country. Boats in common use include large [[container ship]]s, a variety of ferries, passenger ships, sailing ships, and smaller motorised vessels. Traditional wooden vessel [[pinisi]] still widely used as the inter-island freight service within Indonesian archipelago. [[Port of Tanjung Priok]] is Indonesia's busiest port, and the [[List of world's busiest container ports|21st busiest port in the world in 2013]], handling over 6.59 million TEUs.<ref>http://www.worldshipping.org [http://www.worldshipping.org/about-the-industry/global-trade/top-50-world-container-ports Top 50 world container ports]</ref> To boost the port capacity, two-phase "New Tanjung Priok" extension project is currently ongoing. When fully operational in 2023, it will triple existing annual capacity.

[[File:Garuda Indonesia, Airbus A330-200, PK-GPH - NRT.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Garuda Indonesia]] is ranked one of the world's Top Ten Best Airlines.<ref name="worldairlineawards.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.worldairlineawards.com/awards/world_airline_rating.html|title=The World's Top 100 Airlines in 2015}}</ref><ref name="airlinequality.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.airlinequality.com/review-pages/top-10-airlines/|title=The World’s Top 10 Airlines of 2015}}</ref>]]
Frequent ferry services cross the straits between nearby islands, especially in the chain of islands stretching from [[Sumatra]] through [[Java]] to the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]]. On the busy crossings between Sumatra, Java, and [[Bali]], multiple car ferries run frequently twenty-four hours per day. There are also international ferry services between across the [[Strait of Malacca]] between Sumatra and [[Malaysia]], and between [[Singapore]] and nearby Indonesian islands, such as [[Batam]]. A network of passenger ships makes longer connections to more remote islands, especially in the eastern part of the archipelago. The national shipping line, [[Pelni]], provides passenger service to [[port]]s throughout the country on a two to four week schedule. These ships generally provide the least expensive way to cover long distances between islands. Still smaller privately run boats provide service between islands.

As of 2014, there were 237 airports in Indonesia,<ref>http://www.antaranews.com [http://www.antaranews.com/berita/427830/wamenhub-indonesia-bakal-miliki-299-bandara Wamenhub: Indonesia bakal miliki 299 bandara]</ref> including 17 international airports.

[[File:STS-41-B Palapa B-2 deployment.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palapa|Palapa satellite]] was first launched in July 1976, making Indonesia the first [[developing country]] to operate its own satellite system.]]
Living in an agrarian and maritime culture the people in Indonesian's archipelago have been famous in some traditional technologies, particularly in [[agriculture]] and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]. In agriculture, for instance, the people in Indonesia, and also in many other Southeast Asian countries, are famous in paddy cultivation technique namely terasering. [[Bugis]] and [[Makassar people|Makassar]] people in Indonesia are also well-known with their technology in making wooden sailing vessel called [[Pinisi|pinisi boat]].<ref>[http://www.kastenmarine.com/phinisi_history.htm The Indonesian Phinisi]</ref>

In [[aerospace]] technology, Indonesia has a long history in developing military and small commuter aircraft as the only country in Southeast Asia to produce and develop its own aircraft, also producing aircraft components for [[Boeing]] and [[Airbus]], with its state-owned aircraft company (founded in 1976), the [[Indonesian Aerospace]] ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''PT. Dirgantara Indonesia''), which, with [[EADS CASA]] of [[Spain]] developed the [[CASA/IPTN CN-235|CN-235]] aircraft, which has been exported to many countries. [[B. J. Habibie]], a former Indonesian president played an important role in this achievement. While active as a professor in Germany, Habibie conducted many research assignments, producing theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics, known as the Habibie Factor, Habibie Theorem, and Habibie Method respectively.<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/01/30/habibie-receives-honorary-doctorate.html Habibie receives honorary doctorate]</ref> Indonesia also hopes to manufacture the [[South Korea]]n [[KAI KF-X]] fighter.<ref>{{Citation | first = Markus Junianto |last = Sihaloho | title = Indonesia Angling to Help Build S.

Indonesia has a well established railway industry, with its state-owned train manufacturer company, the Indonesian Railway Industry ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''PT. Industri Kereta Api''), located in [[Madiun]], [[East Java]]. Since 1982 the company has been producing passenger train wagons, freight wagons and other railway technologies and exported to many countries, such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Bangladesh]].<ref>[http://www.inka.web.id/?page_id=10 PT. INKA's Products]</ref> In the 1980s an Indonesian engineer, [[Tjokorda Raka Sukawati]] invented a road construction technique named [[Sosrobahu]] which becomes famous afterwards and widely used by many countries. The technology has been exported to the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore and in 1995, a patent was granted to Indonesia.<ref>[http://www.gatra.com/2004-08-13/majalah/beli.php?pil=23&id=43664 Sosrobahu Bertumpu di Atas Piring]</ref>

The music in Indonesia predates historical records, various native Indonesian tribes often incorporate chants and songs accompanied with musics instruments in their rituals.

The diverse world of Indonesian music genres was the result of the musical creativity of its people, and also the subsequent cultural encounters with foreign musical influences into the archipelago. Next to distinctive native form of musics, several genres can traces its origin to foreign influences; such as gambus and qasidah from Middle Eastern Islamic music,<ref>{{cite book |editor-last= Harnish|editor1-first= David|editor2-last=Rasmussen|editor2-first=Anne|year=2011|title=Divine Inspirations: Music and Islam in Indonesia|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> keroncong from Portuguese influences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/06/15/%E2%80%98keroncong%E2%80%99-freedom-music-portuguese-descendants.html |title='Keroncong': Freedom music from Portuguese descendants |publisher=Jakarta Post |accessdate=23 September 2015}}</ref> and dangdut—one of the most popular music genres in Indonesia—with notable Hindi music influence as well as Malay orchestras.<ref>{{cite book |last= Heryanto|first= Ariel|year=2008|title=Popular Culture in Indonesia: Fluid Identities in Post-Authoritarian Politics|publisher=Routledge}}</ref>

[[File:17 Years of Sekar Jepun 2014-11-01 32.jpg|thumb|right|''Oleg'' Balinese dance performed by a pair of dancers.]]
Traditional dance of Indonesia reflect the rich diversity of Indonesian people. The dance traditions in Indonesia; such as Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau, Balinese, Malays, Acehnese and many other dances traditions are age old traditions, yet also a living and dynamic traditions. Several royal houses; the [[istana]]s and [[Kraton (Indonesia)|keraton]]s still survived in some parts of Indonesia and become the haven of cultural conservation. The obvious difference between courtly dance and common folk dance traditions is the most evident in [[Javanese dance]]. The palace court traditions also evident in Balinese and Malay court which usually imposed refinement and prestige. Sumatran courtly culture such as the remnant of Aceh Sultanate and Palembang Sultanate, are more influenced by Islamic culture, while Java and Bali are more deeply rooted in their Hindu-Buddhist heritage.

Dances in Indonesia are believed by many scholars to have had their beginning in rituals and religious worship.<ref>[http://www.indonesia-tourism.com/general/theatre.html The Indonesian Folk Dances]</ref> Such dances are usually based on rituals, like the war dances, the dance of [[witch doctor]]s, and dance to call for rain or any agricultural related rituals such as [[Hudoq]] dance ritual of [[Dayak people]]. In Bali, dances has become the integral part of Hindu Balinese rituals. Sacred ritual dances performed only in [[Balinese temple]]s such as sacred [[Sanghyang|Sanghyang dedari]] and [[Barong (mythology)|Barong]] dance.
The commoners folk dance is more concerned with social function and entertainment value than rituals. The Javanese [[Ronggeng]] and [[Sundanese dance|Sundanese]] [[Jaipongan]] is the fine example of this common folk dance traditions. Both are social dances that are more for entertainment purpose than rituals. [[Randai]] is a folk theatre tradition of the [[Minangkabau people]] which incorporates dance, music, singing, drama and the martial art of [[silat]].<ref name="Pauka1998">{{cite journal |title=The Daughters Take Over?
