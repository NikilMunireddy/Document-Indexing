'''Crystal Palace Football Club''' is an English professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[South Norwood]], [[London]], that plays in the [[Premier League]], the highest tier in English football. 

The club was founded in 1905 at the famous [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] Exhibition building by the owners of the [[FA Cup Final]] stadium, who wanted their own team to play at the historic venue.

Palace played their home games at the Cup Final venue until 1915, but then the [[First World War]] forced them to move out and play at [[Herne Hill Velodrome]] and [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]]. In 1924, they moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]]. 

Palace have been [[FA Cup]] finalists twice in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]], finishing as runners-up on both occasions. Their top flight achievements include a highest ever league finish of third place in the top division in [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]], which saw the club denied a place in Europe because of the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs caused by the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]] and in [[1992–93 FA Premier League|1992]] the club became a founder member of the Premier League. Palace have been [[List of winners of English Football League Championship and predecessors|second tier]] champions twice and have been winners of the [[Football League play-offs|play-offs]] for a record four times. The club have also won two Wartime leagues and are one of only a few clubs that have become inaugural champions of a [[Football League]] division, winning the newly formed [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 1920-21.    

In 1973, the club changed its original nickname from the Glaziers to the Eagles and introduced the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. The club had previously played in claret and blue colours.

Palace have rivalries with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], with whom they contest the [[M23 derby]], and fellow South London club [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].

==History==
{{main|History of Crystal Palace F.C.}}

[[File:Crystal Palace Year Book 1912-1913.jpg|thumb|alt=Front cover of a year book.|right|The Crystal Palace F.C. Year Book for 1912–13]]

In 1895, the Football Association had found a new permanent home for the [[FA Cup Final]] at the site of the famous [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] Exhibition building. Some years later the owners of the attraction, who were reliant on tourist activity for their income, sought fresh attractions for the venue, and decided to form their own football team to play at the Palace stadium. There had been an amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team as far back as 1861, which was formed by workers from the exhibition building, but they had disappeared from historical records around 1876. The owners of the venue wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the vast crowd potential of the area.

Crystal Palace Football Club, originally nicknamed "the Glaziers", was formed on 10 September 1905 under the guidance of [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] assistant secretary [[Edmund Goodman]].<ref name="Business: Club History">{{citation | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ | title=History | publisher=[[CPFC]]| accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> The club applied to enter the [[Football League]] alongside [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], but was the only unsuccessful team of the three. The club instead found itself in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division for the [[1905–06 Football League|1905–06]] season. The club was successful in its inaugural season and was [[Promotion and relegation|promoted]] to the First Division, crowned as champions.<ref name="Business: Club History"/> In their first season Crystal Palace also played in the mid-week United Counties League, finishing runner-up to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], and it was in this competition that the club played their first match, winning 3–0 away to [[New Brompton F.C.|New Brompton]].<ref name="Business: Club History"/><ref>King, p. 10</ref>

Palace remained in the Southern League up until 1914, their one highlight the [[Newcastle United F.C. 0–1 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1907 shock First Round victory]] over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the [[FA Cup]].<ref name=TOON>{{cite book|last=Hutchinson|first=Roger|title=The Toon: A Complete History of Newcastle United Football Club|year=2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-78057-314-4|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mGJsZeq7myAC&pg=PT20&lpg=PT20&dq=newcastle+crystal+palace+1907&source=bl&ots=W0Zojga18D&sig=yAD9saB6DPx6xumFSbUn2DRsPyY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WtzCUZuvAsLP0QX2lIHoBg&ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA}}</ref><ref name=GK>{{cite web|last=Porter|first=Steve|title=All time greatest F A cup giant killings Number 11 Newcastle United 0–1 Crystal Palace|url=http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1907crystalpalace.htm|work=The Giant Killers|accessdate=20 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.freewebs.com/captainbeecher/1907crystalpalace.htm|archivedate=20 June 2013}}</ref> The outbreak of the First World War led to the [[Admiralty]] requisitioning the Crystal Palace and the club was forced to move to the home of West Norwood F.C. at [[Herne Hill Velodrome]].<ref name="Business: Club History"/> Three years later the club moved again to [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]] due to the folding of [[Croydon Common F.C.]] The club joined the [[Football League]] [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in the [[1920–21 Football League|1920–21 season]], finishing as champions and gaining promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. During this period, Palace also won the [[London Challenge Cup]] three times in 1913, 1914, and 1921. Palace moved to the purpose-built stadium [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924, the ground the club plays at today.<ref name="Business: Club History"/><ref>King, pp.&nbsp;15–19</ref>

The opening fixture at Selhurst Park was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], Palace losing 0–1 in front of a crowd of 25,000. Finishing in twenty-first position, the club was relegated to the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]]. Before the [[Second World War]] Palace made good efforts at promotion, never finishing outside the top half of the table and finishing second on three occasions. During the war years, the Football League was suspended, and the club won two [[Wartime League]]s, the South Regional League and the South 'D' League. After the war, the club were less successful in the league, their highest position being seventh, and conversely on three occasions the club had to apply for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]]. The club remained in Division Three South until [[1957–58 in English football|1957–58]]. A league reorganisation would see clubs in the bottom half of the table merge with those in the bottom half of Division Three North to form a new [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Palace finished fourteenth – just below the cut – and found itself in the basement of English football. Their stay proved brief. With [[Arthur Rowe]] appointed manager, the [[1960–61 in English football|1960–61]] season saw Palace gain promotion. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when they played the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era in a friendly match. This was the first time that the Spanish giants had played a match in London. Although Rowe then stepped down for health reasons towards the end of 1962, the promotion proved a turning point in the club's history. [[Dick Graham]] and then [[Bert Head]] guided the club to successive promotions in [[1963–64 in English football|1963–64]] and [[1968–69 in English football|1968–69]], taking the club through the Second Division and into the heights of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]].<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;19–20, 32–7</ref>

Palace stayed in the top flight from 1969 until 1973, but then experienced great disappointment. Under the management of [[Malcolm Allison]] the club was relegated in consecutive seasons, finding itself back in Division Three for the [[1974–75 in English football|1974–75 season]]. It was under Allison that the club became nicknamed "the Eagles" and they enjoyed a run to the semi-final of the [[1975-76 FA Cup]], beating [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] along the way. Allison was sacked at the end of the 1975–76 campaign, and it was under [[Terry Venables]]' management that Palace were promoted in [[1976–77 in English football|1976–77]] and again in [[1978–79 in English football|1978–79]], the latter saw the club crowned as Division Two champions. That team from 1979 was dubbed " The team of the Eighties" and were briefly top of the whole Football League in the early part of the 1979–1980 season, before financial difficulties suffered by the club caused the break up of that talented side, and this ultimately led to the club being unable to maintain their position in the top tier. They were relegated from the First Division in [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]], coinciding with [[Ron Noades]] takeover of the club. [[Steve Coppell]] arrived as manager on 4 June 1984, and under his stewardship and rebuilding the club achieved promotion via the [[Football League play-offs|play-offs]] back to the First Division in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]]. The club followed this up by reaching the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], drawing 3–3 with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the first match but losing the replay 1–0. The club built on the success of the previous season in [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91]] by achieving its highest league finish of third place in the top division. Palace were denied a European place at the end of that season due to the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs caused by the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. The club had also returned to Wembley to win the [[Full Members Cup]]. The club beat [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] 4–1 ([[extra time|after extra time]]) in the final.<ref name="Business: Club History"/> The following season saw star striker [[Ian Wright]] leave the club for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Palace finished tenth, allowing the club to become a founder member of the [[1992–93 FA Premier League|FA Premier League]] in 1992–93.<ref>King, p.&nbsp;39–48</ref>

[[File:Selhurst Park Holmesdale Stand.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a stand adjacent to a road.|Holmesdale Road stand at Selhurst Park, constructed in 1994–95.]]
The club sold [[Mark Bright]] to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] the following season, but failed to rebuild the squad adequately, and Palace struggled to score throughout the season. The club found itself relegated with a total of 49 points, which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. Steve Coppell resigned and [[Alan Smith (manager)|Alan Smith]], his assistant at the club, took over. His first season saw the club win the First Division title and gain promotion to the Premier League.<ref>King, p. 48</ref> Their stay on this occasion proved eventful. On 25 January 1995, Palace played Manchester United at Selhurst Park in which [[Eric Cantona]] was sent off. He was taunted by Palace fan Matthew Simmons,<ref>{{cite news|title=The Cantona affair: Palace offer Frenchman no sympathy|first=Martin|last=Whitfield|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/the-cantona-affair-palace-offer-frenchman-no-sympathy-1570043.html|work=The Independent|date=27 January 1995|accessdate=29 May 2013|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6H6fPYXhX}}</ref> and retaliated with a flying kick.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soccer star attacks a fan|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DUNWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kuoDAAAAIBAJ&dq=crystal%20palace&pg=1390%2C6363284|date=27 January 1995|agency=The Associated Press|newspaper=The Gainesville Sun|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> Cantona was sentenced to two weeks in jail,<ref>{{cite news|title=Jail term may make Cantona quit UK|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/jail-term-may-make-cantona-quit-uk-1612464.html|first=Steve|last=Boggan|date=24 March 1995|accessdate=29 May 2013|work=The Independent|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6H6fW0Cet}}</ref> reduced to 120 hours [[community service]] on appeal.

Smith left the club and Steve Coppell returned as technical director in the summer of 1995, and through a combination of the first-team coaching of [[Ray Lewington]] and latterly [[Dave Bassett]]'s managership Palace reached the [[Football League play-offs|play-offs]]. Palace lost the [[1996 Football League First Division play-off Final|1996 play off final]] in dramatic fashion, [[Steve Claridge]] scoring a last minute goal for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] to win the tie 2–1. The following season saw Coppell take charge as first-team manager when Dave Bassett departed for [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in early 1997<ref>{{cite news|title=Bassett quits Palace and joins Forest|agency=Reuters|work=The Nation|location=Bangkok|publisher=Nation Multimedia Group|date=1 March 1997|accessdate=1 August 2012|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dKZNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=s0MDAAAAIBAJ&dq=bassett%20nottingham%20forest%20manager&pg=6362%2C145781}}</ref> The club was successful in the play-offs at the second time of asking when the club defeated [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the final at Wembley.<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;51–2</ref>

This stay in the Premier League was no more successful than the previous two, and in true [[yo-yo club]] fashion the club was relegated back to the First Division for the [[1998–99 in English football|1998–99]] season. The club competed in European competition during the summer when they played in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. Palace then went into [[Administration (insolvency)|administration]] in 1999, when owner [[Mark Goldberg]] was unable to sustain his financial backing of the club.<ref name=BBC289590>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/the_company_file/289590.stm | title=The Company File: Palace on the rocks| date=3 March 1999|publisher=BBC News | accessdate=26 August 2009}}</ref> The club emerged from administration under the ownership of [[Simon Jordan]], and Steve Coppell left the club, replaced by Alan Smith for a second time. The club flirted with relegation in Jordan's first season, [[2000-01 in English football|2000–01]]. Smith was sacked in April and [[Steve Kember]] managed to win the two remaining fixtures that would guarantee survival, [[Dougie Freedman]] scoring the winner in a 1–0 victory over [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in the 87th minute on the final day of the season.

[[Neil Warnock]] had also departed as manager in the early part of 2010. He had taken over as manager in 2007, replacing [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] who had a brief spell as manager. [[Paul Hart]] took over as caretaker manager for the final weeks of the season.

During the close season CPFC 2010, a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans successfully negotiated the purchase of the club. Led by [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]], the vocal representative for a consortium of four that also included Stephen Browett, [[Jeremy Hosking]] and [[Martin Long]].

Pulis resigned on 14 August 2014, just two days before the start of the 2014–2015 season and was replaced by Neil Warnock who returned to the club for a second spell as manager. However, Warnock was sacked by the club at Christmas after a poor run of results. On 2 January 2015, former Palace player [[Alan Pardew]] was confirmed as the new manager, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract with the club after [[Transfer (association football)#Managers|a compensation package]] of £3.5 million was agreed with Newcastle United.<ref>{{cite news |last=Burt |first=Jason |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/crystal-palace/11323047/Alan-Pardew-confirmed-as-Crystal-Palace-manager-after-Newcastle-release-him-from-contract.html |title=Alan Pardew confirmed as Crystal Palace manager after Newcastle receive £3.5m compensation |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=3 January 2015 |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> Two days later, in his first match in charge, Palace won 4–0 away to [[Conference Premier|Conference]] club [[Dover Athletic F.C.|Dover Athletic]] in the third round of the FA Cup.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rose|first1=Gary|title=Dover 0–4 Crystal Palace|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/30614379|accessdate=4 January 2015|work=BBC Sport|date=4 January 2014}}</ref> Pardew then guided the club to comfortable mid-table safety and a third consecutive season in the Premier League.

==Colours and crest==

When Crystal Palace were founded in 1905, they turned to one of the biggest clubs in the country at the time, [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], to seek advice. Villa helped the club in a number of ways, not least by donating their kit.<ref name=GNTSOTB>{{cite news|title=Nicking the shirts off their backs|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2005/nov/23/theknowledge.sport?INTCMP=SRCH|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=23 November 2005|author=Georgina Turner|author2=James Dart|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HhJ9PvUd|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=RG1>{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}</ref> As a result, Palace's colours were originally claret and blue shirts paired with white shorts, socks tending to be claret. They kept to this formula fairly consistently until 1938. The 1937–38 strip saw them try vertical stripes of claret and blue on the jersey rather than the claret body and blue sleeves, but then in 1938 they abandoned the claret and blue and adopted white shirts and black shorts with matching socks. Although they returned to claret and blue from 1949–54, the 1955 season saw them return to white and black, now using claret and blue as trim.<ref name="HFK">{{cite web|title=Crystal Palace|work=Historical Football Kits|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=1 August 2012|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/Crystal_Palace/Crystal_Palace.htm}}</ref>

[[File:Crystal Palace General view from Water Temple.jpg|thumb|alt=Mono photograph of the front of the Palace and some of its surrounding grounds.|[[The Crystal Palace]], the façade of which appears on the club crest.]]
Variations on this theme lasted until 1963 when the club adopted the away strip of yellow jersey as the home colours. 1964 saw them adopt an all-white strip modelled on [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] whom the club had played recently in a friendly, before they returned to claret and blue jerseys with white shorts in 1966. The club employed variations upon this theme up until [[Malcolm Allison]]'s arrival as manager in 1973.<ref name="HFK"/> Allison overhauled the club's image, adopting red and blue vertical stripes for colours and kit, inspired by [[Barcelona FC|Barcelona]] and [[Levante UD|Levante]].<ref name=GNTSOTB/> The club have played in variations of red and blue ever since, bar the centenary season of 2005 which saw them deploy a version of their 1971–72 claret, blue and white kit.<ref name="HFK"/>

The club were relatively late in establishing a crest. Although the initials were embroidered onto the shirt from the 1935–36 season, a crest featuring the façade of [[the Crystal Palace]] did not appear until 1955. This crest disappeared from the shirt in 1964, and the team's name appeared embroidered on shirts in 1967–72. 1972 saw a round badge adopted with the club's initials and nickname "the Glaziers" before Allison changed this too.<ref name="HFK"/> The nickname became "the Eagles", inspired by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the badge adopted an eagle holding a ball.<ref name="HFK"/> This emblem remained until 1987 when the club married the eagle with the Crystal Palace façade,<ref>{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=Ken|title=Facelift for Crystal Palace's 'Benfica eagle'|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/facelift-for-crystal-palaces-benfica-eagle-7593041.html|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=27 March 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HhI4xKrQ|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref>  and although updated in 1996 and again in 2013 the crest retains these features.<ref name="HFK"/>  Since mid-2010, the club has made use of an [[American bald eagle]], called Kayla, as the club [[mascot]], with the bird flying from one end of the stadium to the other at every home game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bromleytimes.co.uk/news/crystal_palace_eagles_will_be_flying_high_with_new_mascot_1_634203|title=Crystal Palace Eagles will be flying high with new mascot|date=8 September 2010|work=Bromley Times|publisher=Archant Community Media|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.howzit.msn.com/kayla-the-next-breed-of-mascot?page=12|title=Kayla – The Next Breed Of Mascot|date=12 December 2013|work=Howzit MSN Sport|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref>

==Stadium==
{{Main|Selhurst Park}}
In 1905, the owners of the [[FA Cup Final]] venue, the Crystal Palace Company wanted a professional club to play there and tap into the crowd potential of the area. A new club, Crystal Palace F.C., was formed to use the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|stadium]].<ref>King, p. 62</ref> When the [[First World War]] broke out the Palace and grounds were seized by the armed forces, and in 1915 the club were forced to move by the [[Admiralty]]. They found a temporary base at the [[Herne Hill Velodrome]]. Although other clubs had offered the use of their ground to Palace, the club felt it best to remain as close to their natural catchment area as possible.<ref>King, p. 63</ref> When [[Croydon Common F.C.]] were wound up in 1917, the club took over their old stadium at [[Croydon Common Athletic Ground|the Nest]],<ref>King, p. 64</ref> but in 1919 they began the purchase of the land on which they would build [[Selhurst Park]], their current home.<ref name="Matthews-p30,33-5">Matthews pp. 30, 33–5</ref>

[[Archibald Leitch]], the renowned stadium architect, was employed to draw up plans, and the club constructed and completed the ground in time for the [[1924-25 in English football|1924–25 season]].<ref name="Matthews-p30,33-5" /> It remained relatively unchanged, with only the introduction of floodlights and maintenance and updating until 1969 when the Arthur Wait stand was constructed. The Main Stand became all-seater in 1979 and more work followed in the 1980s when the Whitehorse Lane End was redeveloped to allow for a [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket, club offices and a club shop. The Arthur Wait stand became all seater in 1990, and in 1994 the Holmesdale Terrace was redeveloped, replaced with a two tier Stand. Selhurst's attendance record was set in 1979, with an official total of 51,482.<ref>King p.&nbsp;67–71</ref>  After all the redevelopments to the ground and safety requirements due to the [[Taylor Report]], the ground's current capacity is 26,309.<ref name=ESSPSF40>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Simon|title=Crystal Palace: Selhurst Park set for a 40,000 makeover|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/crystal-palace-selhurst-park-set-for-a-40000-makeover-8635930.html|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=Evening Standard|date=29 May 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HhChOXHm|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref> Proposals were put forward to move the club back to the Crystal Palace National Stadium in 2010,<ref>{{cite news|title=Crystal Palace unveil plans for National Sports Centre|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crystal_palace/9364649.stm|accessdate=27 June 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 January 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6HhCvqSHI|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref> but after the club gained promotion to the [[Premier League]] in 2013 there has been a renewed focus on redeveloping their current home into a 40,000 seater stadium.<ref name=ESSPSF40/><ref name=BBCLUX/>

==Support base==
Crystal Palace have a fan base drawn predominantly from the local area which draws on [[South London]], [[Kent]] and [[Surrey]]. The club's original home, [[the Crystal Palace]], was on the boundary with Kent, while Selhurst Park was within Surrey's borders until the [[London Government Act 1963]] saw [[Greater London]] encompass [[Croydon]]. The club's passionate support at home games emanates from the Holmesdale Road Stand, in which the ultras group the Holmesdale Fanatics have been based since 2005. The fans have established at least two other supporters groups. The Palace Independent Supporters' Association was set up to raise supporter concerns with the club,<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://palace-isa.co.uk/about-us/|work=Palace Independent Supporters Association|accessdate=27 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hh2BgmdZ|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref> while the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust was originally established to enable fans to purchase the club during the administration of 2000.  The Trust remained in existence, and now lists one of its aims as building "a new state-of-the-art training ground to lease to the Club".<ref>{{cite web|title=What we do|url=http://palacetrust.org.uk/the-trust/what-we-do/|work=Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust|accessdate=27 June 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hh25IwjO|archivedate=27 June 2013}}</ref>

A number of [[fanzines]] have been produced by the fans over the years. ''Eagle Eye'' launched in 1987 and ran until 1994, with a number of contributors launching the replacement ''Palace Echo'' in 1995, running until 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Palace Echo |url=http://www.palace-echo.net/about.shtml |accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> ''The Eastern Eagles'', ''So Glad You're Mine'' and ''One More Point'' were also published by fans in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | title=Football Fanzines For Sale – (Part 2 – Clubs From C – D) | url=http://home.clara.net/sjafn/fanzinesc_d.htm | accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> When ''One More Point'' ceased publication, ''Five Year Plan'' launched in its place,<ref>{{cite web|title=About FYP |url=http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/about-fyp.html |accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> and maintains an online presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiveyearplanfanzine.co.uk/ | title=Five Year Plan | accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> Supporters also congregate on two [[internet forum]]s, The BBS and Holmesdale.net which the club use as channels to communicate with fans.<ref>{{cite web | format=PDF | title=Crystal Palace F.C.Fans’ Charter Season 2012/13 | url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/documents/fans-charter61-319328.pdf | accessdate=15 July 2012 | publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club }}</ref>

Being a London club means they compete against a number of other local clubs for the attention of supporters but the club does have a recognisably large catchment area of 900,000.<ref name=BBCLUX>{{cite news|last=Stevens|first=Rob|title=Crystal Palace: Steve Parish faces 'luxury problems' after promotion|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22704156|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=30 May 2013|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hi5VDz39|archivedate=28 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Aston Villa: Martin O'Neill ready to rotate squad again |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-martin-oneill-ready-118931 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |date=14 February 2010}}</ref> When the new owners took control of the club in 2010, they sought the fans' input into future decisions.

Foundation they work with local London boroughs of Croydon, Bromley and Sutton to provide sports and educational programmes. Through this work the club hope to develop their supporter base and geographical base. The Foundation's work was recognised by the Football League in August 2009 with their Silver Standard Community Scheme Award.<ref>{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://cpfcfoundation.org/what-we-do/|work=Crystal Palace F.C.

The club also maintains a healthy celebrity support.

==Rivalries==
{{See also|M23 derby|South London derby}}

Because of their location in the capital, Crystal Palace are involved in a number of local derbies, mostly across [[South London derby|South London]]. Their strongest rivalry in London is with [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. They also enjoy a smaller rivalry with former tenants [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. They have a fierce rivalry with [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] which did not develop until Palace's relegation to the Third Division in 1974, reaching its height when the two teams were drawn together in the first round of the 1976–77 FA Cup. The game went to two replays, but the controversy was based on referee Ron Challis ordering a successful Brighton penalty be retaken because of Palace player encroachment. The retake was saved, Palace won the game 1–0 and a fierce rivalry was born.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burnton|first=Simon|title=How Brighton v Crystal Palace grew into an unlikely rivalry|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league-blog/2011/sep/27/brighton-crystal-palace-rivalry|accessdate=26 June 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 September 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Hfnuq6Kd|archivedate=26 June 2013}}</ref>

==Ownership==
[[File:Sydney Bourne and Edmund Goodman circa 1906.jpg|right|alt=Low resolution monochrome photo of two men.|thumb|200|First chairman [[Sydney Bourne]] with [[Edmund Goodman]], 1906.]]
Due to the [[Football League]] not wishing the owners of the [[FA Cup Final]] to also own a team, a separate company was established to found and own the team. The first chairman, [[Sydney Bourne]], was found by club secretary [[Edmund Goodman]] after he had examined records of FA Cup Final ticket purchasers. Goodman noted his name as one that had bought a number of tickets every year, and so he met with Bourne and found him very agreeable to the idea of the new club. Bourne was invited onto the board of directors and elected chairman at the club's first ever meeting. Bourne remained chairman until his death in 1930.<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;8–23</ref>

[[Arthur Wait]] established a consortium of seven businessmen to purchase the club in 1949, and initially they rotated the chairmanship.<ref name="CA1">{{cite news | title=Behind-The-Scenes Shuffle At Palace | work=Croydon Advertiser | date=August 1972 | author=Matthews, John|quote="...&nbsp;whose board he joined in 1948"}}</ref><ref name=CA3>"New Man Bloye Kills 'Moneybags' Tag", ''Croydon Advertiser'', 27 October 1972, p.58"Twenty two years ago&nbsp;... seven men formed a board&nbsp;...

Web. 29 May 2013.</ref> Bloye's ownership lasted until 26 January 1981, when property developer [[Ron Noades]] and his small consortium took control of the club. Noades eventually sold the club to [[Mark Goldberg]] on 5 June 1998, becoming the second longest serving chairman behind Sydney Bourne. Goldberg's tenure of the club was not a success and the club entered administration in March 1999. Although the fans established a group, the Crystal Palace Supporters' Trust in a bid to gain control of the club, millionaire [[Simon Jordan]] negotiated a deal with creditors and the administrator, and a new company, CPFC 2000 took control. This company entered administration in January 2010, leaving administration in June of that year after a takeover by a consortium of four wealthy fans, CPFC 2010.<ref>King, pp.&nbsp;42–60</ref>

Crystal Palace F.C. is currently owned by CPFC 2010 Limited, a [[Private Limited Company]] registered at Company House.

[[File:CrystalPalaceFC League Performance.svg|thumb|left|Chart showing Crystal Palace's table positions since joining the Football League.]]Crystal Palace hold a number of records and achievements. They are one of only a small group of clubs to have been inaugural champions of a Football League Division, winning the newly formed [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] in 1920–21. Their average league attendance of 19,092 achieved in the 1960–61 season and the attendance of 37,774 for the [[Good Friday]] game at [[Selhurst Park]] between Palace and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] the same season are [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] attendance records.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |title=Division Four 1960/61 | accessdate=15 July 2013}}</ref> The club's widest victory margin in the league was their 9–0 win against [[Barrow F.C.|Barrow]] in the Fourth Division in 1959, while their heaviest defeat in the league was by the same scoreline, 9–0, against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 1989 in Division One.<ref name=K444>King, p. 444</ref>

Palace's record home attendance is 51,482 for a Division Two match against [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], achieved on 11 May 1979.<ref name=K444/> With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future. The highest transfer fee received for a Palace player is £15&nbsp;million, from [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] for [[Wilfried Zaha]] in January 2013, while the highest transfer fee paid by the club to date was for [[Yohan Cabaye]] from [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in July 2015, thought to be around £13 million. The club's highest ever league finish so far is third place in the [[Football League First Division]] which is now called the [[Premier League]] achieved in 1990–91, under the management of Steve Coppell. The club have been [[FA Cup]] finalists twice in [[1990 FA Cup Final|1990]] and [[2016 FA Cup Final|2016]], finishing runners-up on both occasions and have also reached the semi-final on two other occasions. Palace have reached the semi-finals of the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] four times, most recently in 2012. The club were winners of the [[Full Members Cup]] in [[1990–91 Full Members Cup|1990–91]]. 
 
Palace remain the only team ever to be relegated from the Premier League even though they finished 4th from bottom in the 1994/1995 season. This was because it had been decided that the following season would see the Premier League reduced from 22 teams down to the current standard of 20. Palace also hold the record for relegations from the Premier League with a total of 4, (1992/93, 1994/95, 1997/98, 2004/05), but conversely they also hold the record for most Play Off wins resulting in promotion to the Premier League amassing 4 Play Off victories, they also hold the record (in any division) for winning promotion at 4 different locations, (Selhurst Park 1989, Old Wembley 1997, Millennium Stadium 2004 and New Wembley 2013).
