== Etymology ==
''Albania'' is the [[Medieval Latin]] name of the country, from the [[Medieval Greek]] [[wikt:Ἀλβανία|Ἀλβανία]] ''Albania''. The country is called ''Shqipëri'' by its people. The name may be derived from the [[Illyrian tribe]] of the Albani recorded by [[Ptolemy]], the geographer and astronomer from [[Alexandria]] who drafted a map in 150&nbsp;AD that shows the city of [[Albanopolis]] located northeast of [[Durrës]].<ref>Madrugearu A, Gordon M. The wars of the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. Rowman & Littlefield, 2007. p. 146.</ref><ref>{{Barrington|49 & notes}}</ref>

The name may have a continuation in the name of a medieval settlement called Albanon and Arbanon, although it is not certain this was the same place.<ref>The Illyrians by J. J. Wilkes, 1992, ISBN 978-0-631-19807-9, page 279,"We cannot be certain that the Arbanon of Anna Comnena is the same as Albanopolis of the Albani, a place located on the map of Ptolemy (3.12)"</ref> In his ''History'' written in 1079–1080, the [[Byzantine]] historian [[Michael Attaliates]] was the first to refer to ''[[Albanoi]]'' as having taken part in a revolt against [[Constantinople]] in 1043 and to the ''Arbanitai'' as subjects of the Duke of [[Dyrrachium]].<ref>Robert Elsei. ''The Albanian lexicon of Dion Von Kirkman. Earliest reference to the existence of the Albanian language'', pp. 113–122.</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], the Albanians called their country ''Arbëri'' or ''Arbëni'' and referred to themselves as [[Arbëresh]] or ''Arbënesh''.<ref>[http://www.pinocacozza.it/ Pinocacozza.it {{sq icon}}] {{it icon}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-arberesh.eu/|title=Radio-Arberesh.eu|author=Casanova|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

As early as the 17th century the placename ''Shqipëria'' and the ethnic demonym ''Shqiptarë'' gradually replaced ''Arbëria'' and ''Arbëresh''. The two terms are [[folk etymology|popularly]] interpreted as "Land of the Eagles" and "Children of the Eagles".<ref>Kristo Frasheri. ''History of Albania (A Brief Overview)''.

==History==
{{Main|History of Albania}}

The history of Albania emerged from the [[Prehistoric Balkans|prehistoric stage]] from the 4th century BC, with early records of [[Illyria]] in [[Greco-Roman historiography]]. The modern territory of Albania has no counterpart in antiquity, comprising parts of the Roman provinces of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] (southern [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]) and [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] (particularly [[Epirus Nova]]).

===Prehistory===
The first traces of human presence in Albania, dating to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] and [[Upper Paleolithic]] eras, were found in the village of Xarrë, near [[Sarandë]] and [[Mount Dajt]] near [[Tiranë]].<ref name="Prendi">F. Prendi, "The Prehistory of Albania", ''The Cambridge Ancient History'', 2nd edn., vol. 3, part 1: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vXljf8JqmkoC&pg=PA187 The Prehistory of the Balkans; and the Middle East and the Aegean World, Tenth to Eighth Centuries B.C.]'', ed. John Boardman et al. (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1982), 189–90.</ref> The objects found in a cave near Xarrë include flint and jasper objects and fossilized animal bones, while those found at Mount Dajt comprise bone and stone tools similar to those of the [[Aurignacian culture]]. The Paleolithic finds of Albania show great similarities with objects of the same era found at Crvena Stijena in Montenegro and north-western Greece.<ref name="Prendi"/>

===Antiquity===

[[File:Illyria and Dardania Kingdoms.png|thumb|left|[[Illyria|Kingdom of Illyria]] and [[Dardanian Kingdom|Dardania]] in the 3rd century BC]]
In ancient times, the territory of modern Albania was mainly inhabited by a number of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes. This territory was known as [[Illyria]], corresponding roughly to the area east of the Adriatic sea to the mouth of the [[Vjosë]] river in the south.<ref>The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes, 1996, ISBN 978-0-631-19807-9, page 92, "Appian's description of the Illyrian territories records a southern boundary with Chaonia and Thesprotia, where ancient Epirus began south of river Aoous (Vjose)"  [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&lpg=PP1&dq=illyrians%20wilkes&pg=PR20 also map]</ref><ref>Cambridge University Press.

One of the most powerful tribes that ruled over modern Albania was the [[Ardiaei]]. The Ardiaen Kingdom reached its greatest extent under [[Agron of Illyria]], son of [[Pleuratus II]]. Agron extended his rule over other neighboring tribes as well.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A History of Macedonia: 336-167 B.C|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qpb3JdwuDQIC|publisher = Clarendon Press|date = 1 January 1972|isbn = 9780198148159|first = Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière|last = Hammond|first2 = Frank William|last2 = Walbank}}</ref> After Agron's death in 230 BC, his wife Teuta inherited the&nbsp;Ardiaean kingdom.

The territorial nucleus of the Albanian state formed in the Middle Ages, as the [[Principality of Arbër]] and the [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]].
The [[Principality of Arbër]] or '''Albanon''' ([[Albanian language|Albanian]]): Arbër or Arbëria, was the first [[Albanian Principalities|Albanian state]] during the [[Middle Ages]] , it was established by ''[[archon]]'' [[Progon of Kruja|Progon]] in the region of [[Kruja]], in c. 1190.

After the death of Dhimiter, the last of the [[Progon family]], the principality came under [[Gregory Kamonas]], and later [[Golem of Kruja|Golem]]. The Principality was dissolved in 1255.<ref name=Clements31>Clements 1992, p. 31 ''"By 1190, Byzantium's power had so receded that the archon Progon succeeded in establishing the first Albanian state of the Middle Ages, a principality"''</ref><ref name="PickardÇeliku2008">Pickard-Çeliku 2008, p. 16</ref><ref name="Norris1993">Norris 1993, p. 35</ref> Pipa and Repishti conclude that Arbanon was the first sketch of an "Albanian state", and that it retained semi-autonomous status as the western extremity of an empire (under the [[Doukas|Doukai]] of [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] or the [[Laskaris|Laskarids]] of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]]).<ref>Pipa-Repishti 1983, pp.&nbsp;7–8</ref> The Kingdom of Albania was established by Charles of Anjou in the Albanian territory he conquered from the Despotate of Epirus in 1271. He took the title of "King of Albania" in February 1272. The kingdom extended from the region of Durrës (then known as Dyrrhachium) south along the coast to Butrint. After the creation of the kingdom, a Catholic political structure was a good basis for the papal plans of spreading Catholicism in the Balkans. This plan found also the support of Helen of Anjou, a cousin of Charles of Anjou, who was at that time ruling territories in North Albania. Around 30 Catholic churches and monasteries were built during her rule in North Albania and in Serbia.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Regnum Albaniae, the Papal Curia, and the Western Visions of a Borderline Nobility|last = Etleva|first = Lala|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2008|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = http://www.etd.ceu.hu/2009/mphlae01.pdf}}</ref> During 1331–55, the Serbian empire wrestled control over Albania. After the dissolution of the Serbian empire, several Albanian principalities were created, and among the most powerful were the Balsha, Thopia, Kastrioti, Muzaka and Arianiti. In the first half of the 14th century, the Ottoman Empire invaded most of Albania. But in 1444, the Albanian principalities were united under [[Skanderbeg|George Castrioti Skanderbeg]], the national hero of Albania.

At the dawn of the establishment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Southeast Europe, the geopolitical landscape was marked by scattered kingdoms of small principalities. The Ottomans erected their garrisons throughout southern Albania by 1415 and occupied most of Albania by 1431.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Licursi |first=Emiddio Pietro|title=Empire of Nations: The Consolidation of Albanian and Turkish National Identities in the Late Ottoman Empire, 1878–1913 |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/72122169/7/Pashko-Vasa|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |origyear=|year=2011 |publisher= Columbia University |location= New York |language= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |doi_inactivedate= |bibcode= |id=|page=19 |pages= |nopp= |at= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= By 1415, after a chaotic interregnum, Sultan Mehmet I sent the military to erect the first Ottoman garrisons throughout southern Albania, establishing direct military authority in the region&nbsp;... l jurisdiction over most of Albania&nbsp;... |postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Skanderbeg]] united initially the Albanian princes, and later on established a centralized authority over most of the non-conquered territories, becoming the ruling Lord of Albania. He also tried relentlessly but rather unsuccessfully to create a European coalition against the Ottomans. He thwarted every attempt by the Turks to regain Albania, which they envisioned as a springboard for the invasion of Italy and western Europe. His unequal fight against the mightiest power of the time won the esteem of Europe as well as some support in the form of money and military aid from Naples, the Papacy, Venice, and Ragusa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12472/Albania/42646/The-decline-of-Byzantium|title=Albania :: The decline of Byzantium – Encyclopedia Britannica|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

In the 15th century, when the Ottomans were gaining a firm foothold in the region, Albanian towns were organised into four principal [[sanjaks]]. The government fostered trade by settling a sizeable Jewish colony of refugees fleeing persecution in Spain (at the end of the 15th century). [[Vlorë]] saw passing through its ports imported merchandise from Europe such as velvets, cotton goods, mohairs, carpets, spices and leather from [[Bursa]] and [[Constantinople]]. Some citizens of Vlorë even had business associates in Europe.<ref name="Arnawutluá¸³ - Brill Reference"/>

Albanians could also be found throughout the empire in Iraq, Egypt, Algeria and across the [[Maghreb]], as vital military and administrative retainers.<ref>H. T. Norris, Islam in the Balkans: Religion and Society Between Europe and the Arab World, p. 196.</ref> This was partly due to the [[Devşirme]] system. The process of Islamization was an incremental one, commencing from the arrival of the Ottomans in the 14th century (to this day, a minority of Albanians are Catholic or Orthodox Christians, though the vast majority became Muslim). [[Timar]] holders, the bedrock of early Ottoman control in Southeast Europe, were not necessarily converts to Islam, and occasionally rebelled; the most famous of these rebels is [[Skanderbeg]] (his figure would rise up later on, in the 19th century, as a central component of the Albanian national identity). The most significant impact on the Albanians was the gradual Islamisation process of a large majority of the population, although it became widespread only in the 17th century.<ref name="referenceworks.brillonline">Clayer, Nathalie.

===Era of nationalism and League of Prizren===

[[File:Albanian vilayet.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Map outlining the [[Albanian Vilayet]] requested by the League of Prizren]]
The [[League of Prizren]] was formed on 1 June 1878, in [[Prizren]], [[Kosovo Vilayet]] of Ottoman Empire. At first the Ottoman authorities supported the League of Prizren, whose initial position was based on the religious solidarity of Muslim [[landlords]] and people connected with the [[Ottoman Porte|Ottoman administration]]. The Ottomans favoured and protected Muslim solidarity, and called for defense of Muslim lands, including present-day Bosnia and Herzegovina. This was the reason for naming the league ''The Committee of the Real Muslims'' ({{lang-sq|Komiteti i Myslimanëve të Vërtetë}}).<ref>{{Citation |last=Kopecek |first=Michal |authorlink= |first2= Ahmed|last2= Ersoy|first3=Maciej|last3=Gorni |first4=Vangelis |last4= Kechriotis |first5= Boyan |last5= Manchev |first6= Balazs |last6= Trencsenyi |first7= Marius  |last7= Turda  |author-separator= |editor= |editorn= |editorn-last= |editorn-first= |editor-link= |editorn-link= |others= |title= Discourses of collective identity in Central and Southeast Europe (1770–1945)|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=k5Vsjg508EYC&pg=PA349&dq=%22albanian+vilayet%22+%22Greater+albania%22#v=onepage&q&f=false|archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate= 18 January 2011 |edition= |series= |volume= 1|year=2006 |publisher=Central European University Press |location= Budapest, Hungary|isbn=963-7326-52-9 |oclc= |doi= |doi_inactivedate= |bibcode=  |page= 348 |pages= |nopp= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= The position of the League in the beginning was based on religious solidarity.

The Ottomans cancelled their support when the League, under the influence of [[Abdyl Frashëri|Abdyl bey Frashëri]], became focused on working toward Albanian autonomy and requested merging of four Ottoman vilayets ([[Kosovo Vilayet|Kosovo]], [[Scutari Vilayet|Scutari]], [[Monastir Vilayet|Monastir]] and [[Janina Vilayet|Ioannina]]) into a new ''[[vilayet]]'' of the [[Ottoman Empire]] (the [[Albanian Vilayet]]). The League used military force to prevent the annexing areas of [[Plav Municipality|Plav]] and [[Gusinje]] assigned to Montenegro by the [[Congress of Berlin]]. After several successful battles with Montenegrin troops such as in [[Battle of Novšiće|Novsice]],under the pressure of the [[great powers]],the League of Prizren was forced to retreat from their contested regions of Plav and Gusinje and later on,the league was defeated by the Ottoman army sent by the Sultan.<ref name="League of Prizren">{{cite web|title=Albanian League|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12553/Albanian-League|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>
The [[Albanian Revolt of 1912|Albanian uprising of 1912]], the Ottoman defeat in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the advance of Montenegrin, Serbian and Greek forces into territories claimed as Albanian, led to the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|proclamation of independence]] by [[Ismail Qemali]] in [[Vlora]], on 28 November 1912.

In 1925 the four-member Regency was abolished and Ahmed Zogu was elected president of the newly declared republic. [[Tirana]] was endorsed officially as the country's permanent capital.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Albanians: A Modern History|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IzI0uOZ2j6gC|publisher = I.B.Tauris|date = 1 January 1999|isbn = 978-1-86064-541-9|first = Miranda|last = Vickers|page = 118}}</ref> Zogu led an authoritarian and conservative regime, the primary aim of which was the maintenance of stability and order.

The Albanian republic was eventually replaced by another [[Kingdom of Albania (1928–39)|monarchy]] in 1928. In order to extend his direct control throughout the entire country, Zogu placed great emphasis on the construction of roads. Every male Albanian over the age of 16 years was legally bound to give ten days of free labor each year to the state.<ref name=":0" /> King Zogu remained a conservative, but initiated reforms. For example, in an attempt at social modernization, the custom of adding one's region to one's name was dropped. Zogu also made donations of land to international organisations for the building of schools and hospitals. The armed forces were trained and supervised by Italian instructors. As a counterweight, Zogu kept British officers in the [[Gendarmerie]] despite strong Italian pressure to remove them. The kingdom was supported by the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime in Italy]] and the two countries maintained close relations until Italy's sudden [[Italian invasion of Albania|invasion of the country]] in 1939. Albania was occupied by [[Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy]] and [[Albanian Kingdom (1943-1944)|then]] by [[Nazi Germany]] during World War II.

After being [[Italian invasion of Albania|militarily occupied by Italy]], from 1939 until 1943 the [[Albanian Kingdom (1939–43)|Albanian Kingdom]] was a [[protectorate]] and a [[Dependent territory|dependency]] of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] governed by the Italian King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] and his government. After the Axis' [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, territories of Yugoslavia with substantial Albanian population were annexed to Albania: most of Kosovo,{{efn|name=status}} as well as Western Macedonia, the town of [[Tutin, Serbia|Tutin]] in Central Serbia and a strip of Eastern Montenegro.<ref name="BogdaniLoughlin2007">{{cite book|last1=Bogdani|first1=Mirela|last2=Loughlin|first2=John|title=Albania and the European Union: The Tumultuous Journey Towards Integration and Accession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32Wu8H7t8MwC&pg=PA230|date=15 March 2007|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-308-7|page=230}}</ref> In November 1941, the small Albanian Communist groups established an&nbsp;Albanian Communist Party&nbsp;in Tirana of 130 members under the leadership of [[Enver Hoxha]] and an eleven-man Central Committee. The party at first had little mass appeal, and even its youth organization netted few recruits. After March 1943, the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] formed its first and second regular battalions, which subsequently became brigades, to operate along with existing smaller and irregular units. Resistance to the occupation grew rapidly as signs of Italian weakness became apparent. At the end of 1942, guerrilla forces numbered no more than 8,000 to 10,000. By the summer of 1943, when the Italian effort collapsed, almost all of the mountainous interior was controlled by resistance units.<ref>{{cite web|title=World War II|url=http://countrystudies.us/albania/151.htm|website=countrystudies.us|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>[[File:Tirana Albania 1944-11-20.jpg|thumb|260px|[[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|Albanian partisans]] march in [[Tirana]] 29 November 1944]]

After the capitulation of Italy in 1943, Nazi Germany occupied Albania too. The nationalist [[Balli Kombëtar|Balli Kombetar]], which had fought against Italy, formed a "neutral" government in Tirana, and side by side with the Germans fought against the communist-led [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement of Albania]].<ref name="Morrock2010">{{cite book|last=Morrock|first=Richard|title=The Psychology of Genocide and Violent Oppression: A Study of Mass Cruelty from Nazi Germany to Rwanda|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZtnAbKkOmIC&pg=PA55|date=11 October 2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5628-4|page=55|quote=The nationalist Balli Kombetar, which had fought against Italy, made a deal with the German invaders, and formed a "neutral" government in Tirana which&nbsp;...}}</ref> The Center for Relief to Civilian Populations (Geneva) reported that Albania was one of the most devastated countries in Europe. 60,000 houses were destroyed and about 10% of the population was left homeless.The communist partisans had regrouped and gained control of much of southern Albania in January 1944. However, they were subject to German attacks driving them out of certain areas. In the Congress of Përmet, the NLF formed an Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation to act as Albania's administration and legislature. By the last year in WWII Albania fell into a civil war-like state between the communists and nationalists. The communist partisans however defeated the last Balli Kombëtar forces in southern Albania by mid-summer 1944. Before the end of November, the main German troops had withdrawn from [[Tirana]], and the communists took control by attacking it. The partisans entirely liberated Albania from German occupation on 29 November 1944. A provisional government, which the communists had formed at&nbsp;Berat&nbsp;in October, administered Albania with Enver Hoxha as prime minister.

By the end of [[World War II]], the main military and political force in the country, the Communist party, sent forces to northern Albania against the nationalists to eliminate its rivals. They faced open resistance in Nikaj-Mertur, Dukagjin and Kelmend (Kelmendi was led by [[Prek Cali]]).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.me/books?id=IJ2s9sQ9bGkC&pg=PA431&dq=Anti+Communist+Uprising+albania&hl=en&sa=X&ei=G5bhUsjnD9GThgefw4GYCQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Anti%20Communist%20Uprising%20albania&f=false |title=The Albanians: An Ethnic History from Prehistoric Times to the Present – Edwin E.

After the liberation of Albania from Nazi occupation, the country became a [[Communist state]], the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|People's Republic of Albania]] (renamed "the People's Socialist Republic of Albania" in 1976), which was led by [[Enver Hoxha]] and the [[Labour Party of Albania]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The socialist reconstruction of Albania was launched immediately after the annulling of the monarchy and the establishment of a "[[People's Republic]]". In 1947, Albania's first railway line was completed, with the second completed eight months later. New land reform laws were passed granting the land to the workers and peasants who tilled it. Agriculture became [[Worker cooperative|cooperative]], and production increased significantly, leading to Albania's becoming agriculturally self-sufficient. By 1955, illiteracy was eliminated among Albania's adult population.<ref>''40 Years of Socialist Albania'', Dhimiter Picani</ref>

Religious freedoms were severely curtailed during the Communist period, with all forms of worship being outlawed. In August 1945, the Agrarian Reform Law meant that large swaths of property owned by religious groups (mostly Islamic [[waqfs]]) were nationalized, along with the estates of monasteries and dioceses. Many believers, along with the [[ulema]] and many [[priests]], were arrested, tortured and executed. In 1949, a new Decree on Religious Communities required that all their activities be sanctioned by the state alone.<ref>Library of Congress Country Studies, Albania: Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign</ref>

In 1967, after hundreds of mosques and dozens of Islamic libraries containing priceless manuscripts were destroyed, Hoxha proclaimed Albania the "world's first [[State atheism|atheist state]]".<ref>Kombësia dhe feja në Shqipëri, 1920–1944 / Roberto Morocco dela Roka ; e përktheu nga origjinali Luan Omari.</ref><ref name = "Elsie p27">{{Cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of Albania|last=Elsie|first=Robert|publisher=[[The Scarecrow Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-810-86188-6|edition=2nd|series=Historical Dictionaries of Europe, No. 75|location=Lanham, MD, and Plymouth|page=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&pg=PA27 27]}}</ref> The country's churches had not been spared either, and many were converted into cultural centers for young people. A 1967 law banned all "fascist, religious, warmongerish, antisocialist activity and propaganda." Preaching religion carried a three to ten years prison sentence. Nonetheless, many Albanians continued to practice their beliefs secretly. The Hoxha dictatorship's anti-religion crusade attained its most fundamental legal and political expression a decade later: "The state recognizes no religion," declared Communist Albania's 1976 constitution, "and supports and carries out atheistic propaganda in order to implant a scientific materialistic world outlook in people."<ref name = "Elsie p27" />

Hoxha's political successor [[Ramiz Alia]] oversaw the dismemberment of the "[[Hoxhaist]]" state during the breakup of the [[Eastern Bloc]] in the later 1980s.

===Post-Communist Albania===
{{main|Fall of communism in Albania}}
After protests beginning in 1989 and reforms made by the communist government in 1990, the People's Republic was dissolved in 1991–92 and the Republic of Albania was founded. The communists retained a stronghold in parliament after popular support in the elections of 1991. However, in March 1992, amid liberalization policies resulting in economic collapse and social unrest, a new front led by the new [[Democratic Party of Albania|Democratic Party]] took power.

[[File:Albanian army deploys T-59 tanks near Kosovo border, May 1999 (Robert Wright).jpg|thumb|260px|Albanian T-59 tanks near Kosovo border, May 1999 during the [[Kosovo war]]]]In the following years, much of the accumulated wealth of the country was invested in [[Ponzi scheme|Ponzi]] pyramid banking schemes, which were widely supported by government officials. The schemes swept up somewhere between one-sixth to one-third of the country's population.<ref>Jarvis, Christopher. 2000.

"Tales from Albarado: The Materiality of Pyramid Schemes in Post-socialist Albania." ''Cultural Anthropology'', Vol 26(1): 84–110.</ref> The schemes began to collapse in late 1996, leading many of the investors into initially peaceful protests against the government, requesting their money back. The protests turned violent in February as government forces responded with fire. In March the police and Republican Guard deserted, leaving their armories open. They were promptly emptied by militias and criminal gangs. The [[1997 rebellion in Albania|resulting crisis]] caused a wave of evacuations of foreign nationals<ref>[[Operation Libelle]]</ref><ref>[[Operation Silver Wake]]</ref> and of refugees.<ref>The [[Albanian diaspora|mass emigration of Albanians]] was mostly to [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]], [[Albanian communities in Greece|Greece]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]], [[Albanians in Germany|Germany]] and North America.</ref>

The crisis led Prime Minister [[Aleksandër Meksi]] to resign on 11 March 1997, followed by President [[Sali Berisha]] in July in the wake of the June General Election. In April 1997, [[Operation Alba]], a UN peacekeeping force led by Italy, entered the country with two goals: assistance in evacuation of expatriates and to secure the ground for international organizations. This was primarily WEU MAPE, who worked with the government in restructuring the judicial system and police. The Socialist Party won the elections in 1997, and a degree of political stabilization followed.

In 1999, the country was affected by the [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Kosovo War]], when a great number of Albanians from Kosovo found refuge in Albania.

Albania became a full member of [[NATO]] in 2009, and has [[Accession of Albania to the European Union|applied]] to join the [[European Union]]. In 2013, the Socialist Party won the national elections. In June 2014, the Republic of Albania became an official candidate for accession to the European Union.

The Euro-Atlantic integration of Albania has been the ultimate goal of the post-communist governments. Albania's EU membership bid has been set as a priority by the European Commission.

Albania, along with Croatia, joined NATO on 1 April 2009, becoming the 27th and 28th members of the alliance.<ref>{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7977332.stm | accessdate =2 April 2009 |work=BBC News |title=Nato welcomes Albania and Croatia | date=1 April 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090404233013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7977332.stm| archivedate= 4 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

=== Executive branch ===
[[File:Cabinet of albania logo.svg|thumb|right|175px|Cabinet of Albania Logo]]
The head of state in Albania is the [[List of Presidents of Albania|President]] of the Republic. The President is elected to a 5-year term by the Assembly by secret ballot, requiring a 50%+1 majority of the votes of all deputies. The current President of the Republic is Bujar Nishani elected in July 2012.

The President has the power to guarantee observation of the constitution and all laws, act as commander in chief of the armed forces, exercise the duties of the Assembly of the Republic of Albania when the Assembly is not in session, and appoint the Chairman of the Council of Ministers (prime minister).

Executive power rests with the Council of Ministers (cabinet). The Chairman of the Council (prime minister) is appointed by the president; ministers are nominated by the president on the basis of the prime minister's recommendation. The People's Assembly must give final approval of the composition of the Council. The Council is responsible for carrying out both foreign and domestic policies. It directs and controls the activities of the ministries and other state organs.

The [[Assembly of Albania|Assembly of the Republic of Albania]] (''Kuvendi i Republikës së Shqipërisë'') is the lawmaking body in Albania. There are 140 deputies in the Assembly, which are elected through a [[party-list proportional representation]] system. The President of the Assembly (or Speaker), who has two deputies, chairs the Assembly. There are 15 permanent commissions, or committees. Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years.

The Assembly has the power to decide the direction of domestic and foreign policy; approve or amend the constitution; declare war on another state; ratify or annul international treaties; elect the President of the Republic, the Supreme Court, and the Attorney General and his or her deputies; and control the activity of state radio and television, state news agency and other official information media.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Albania}}

Albania is divided into 12 administrative counties ({{lang-sq|qark or prefekturë}}). Since June 2015, these counties are divided into 61 municipalities ({{lang-sq|bashki}}). These counties were further divided in 36 districts ({{lang-sq|rreth}}) which became defunct in 2000.<ref name="terref">[http://www.reformaterritoriale.al/en/roadmap/history A Brief History of the Administrative-territorial Organization in Albania]</ref> The government introduced a new administrative division to be implemented in 2015 whereby municipalities are reduced to 61 in total, while rural ones called ''komuna'' are abolished. The defunct municipalities will be known as Neighborhoods or Villages ({{lang-sq|Lagje / Fshat}}).<ref>http://www.top-channel.tv/lajme/artikull.php?id=292404</ref><ref>http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&kat=88</ref> There are overall 2980 villages/communities ({{lang-sq|fshat}}) in all Albania, formerly known as localities ({{lang-sq|lokalitete}}). The municipalities are the first level of local governance, responsible for local needs and law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moi.gov.al/english/images/pdf/qeverisja_vendore.pdf |title=On the Organization and Functioning of the Local Government, Republic of Albania, 2000 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 August 2010|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5sskA8M0G |archivedate = 20 September 2010|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Albania has a total area of {{convert|28748|km2|0|abbr=off}}. It lies between latitudes [[39th parallel north|39°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[19th meridian east|19°]] and [[21st meridian east|21° E]] (a small area lies east of 21°). Albania's coastline length is {{convert|476|km|0|abbr=on}}<ref name="Albania pdf">{{cite web| author=R.

The lowlands of the west face the Adriatic Sea.

The 70% of the country that is mountainous is rugged and often inaccessible from the outside. The highest mountain is [[Mount Korab|Korab]] situated in the [[district of Dibër]], reaching up to {{convert|2764|m|ft}}. The climate on the coast is typically [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] with mild, wet winters and warm, sunny, and rather dry summers.

Inland conditions vary depending on elevation, but the higher areas above 1,500&nbsp;m/5,000&nbsp;ft are rather cold and frequently snowy in winter; here cold conditions with snow may linger into spring. Besides the capital city of [[Tirana]], which has 420,000 inhabitants, the principal cities are [[Durrës]], [[Korçë]], [[Elbasan]], [[Shkodër]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Vlorë]] and [[Kukës]]. In Albanian grammar, a word can have indefinite and definite forms, and this also applies to city names: both ''Tiranë'' and ''Tirana'', ''Shkodër'' and ''Shkodra'' are used.

The three largest and deepest tectonic lakes of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] are partly located in Albania. [[Lake Shkodër]] in the country's northwest has a surface which can vary between {{convert|370|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and 530&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, out of which one third belongs to Albania and rest to Montenegro. The Albanian shoreline of the lake is {{convert|57|km|0|abbr=on}}. [[Ohrid Lake]] is situated in the country's southeast and is shared between Albania and Republic of Macedonia. It has a maximal depth of 289&nbsp;meters and a variety of unique flora and fauna can be found there, including "living fossils" and many endemic species. Because of its natural and historical value, Ohrid Lake is under the protection of [[UNESCO]]. There is also Butrinti Lake which is a small tectonic lake. It is located in the national park of Butrint.

=== Climate ===
[[File:PalasëKüstePanorama.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Albanian Riviera]] as seen from Llogora Pass along SH8]]
[[File:Albania map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|175px|Albania map of Köppen climate classification.|left]]
With its coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a high number of climatic regions relative to its landmass. The coastal lowlands have typically Mediterranean climate; the highlands have a Mediterranean continental climate. In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.

The lowlands have mild winters, averaging about {{convert|7|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Summer temperatures average {{convert|24|°C|0|abbr=on}}. In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} higher throughout the year. The difference is greater than {{convert|5|C-change|0|abbr=on}} during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.

Inland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the [[Balkan]]s. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and [[river valley]]s are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.

Average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the continental air mass. Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.

[[File:Albania pasture.jpg|thumb|left|Landscape of Albanian countryside]]
When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland. When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter. Because the season's lower temperatures damage olive trees and citrus fruits, groves and orchards are restricted to sheltered places with southern and western exposures, even in areas with high average winter temperatures.

Lowland rainfall averages from {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to more than {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} annually, with the higher levels in the north. Nearly 95% of the rain falls in the winter.

Rainfall in the upland mountain ranges is heavier. Adequate records are not available, and estimates vary widely, but annual averages are probably about {{convert|1800|mm|in|1|sp=us}} and are as high as {{convert|2550|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in some northern areas. The western Albanian Alps (valley of Boga) are among the wettest areas in Europe, receiving some {{convert|3100|mm|1|abbr=on}} of rain annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qendrim.forumotion.net/gjeografia-f61/tiparet-e-pergjithshme-te-klimes-t3725.htm |title=Tiparet e pergjithshme te klimes |publisher=Qendrim.forumotion.net |date=20 December 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref> The seasonal variation is not quite as great in the coastal area.

The higher inland mountains receive less precipitation than the intermediate uplands. Terrain differences cause wide local variations, but the seasonal distribution is the most consistent of any area.

In 2009, an expedition from University of Colorado discovered four small glaciers in the "Cursed" mountains in North Albania. The glaciers are at the relatively low level of {{convert|2000|m|ft}}, almost unique for such a southerly latitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://instaar.metapress.com/content/273213h3t4370272/ |title=Twenty-first Century Glaciers and Climate in the Prokletije Mountains, Albania Journal Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research Publisher Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research, University of Colorado ISSN 1523-0430 (Print) 1938–4246 (Online) Issue Volume 41, Number 4 / November 2009 DOI 10.1657/1938-4246-41.4.455 Pages 455–459 Online Date: 30 November 2009|publisher=Instaar.metapress.com |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref>

Although a small country, Albania is distinguished for its rich [[biological]] diversity. The variation of geomorphology, climate and terrain create favorable conditions for a number of endemic and sub-endemic species with 27 endemic and 160 subendemic vascular plants present in the country. The total number of plants is over 3250 species, approximately 30% of the entire flora species found in Europe.

Over a third of the territory of Albania&nbsp;– about {{convert|10000|km2|0|abbr=off}};– is forested and the country is very rich in flora. About 3,000 different species of plants grow in Albania, many of which are used for medicinal purposes. [[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Albania belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]], the [[Mediterranean Region]] and the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]]. Coastal regions and lowlands have typical Mediterranean [[macchia]] vegetation, whereas [[oak]] forests and vegetation are found on higher elevations. Vast forests of [[European black pine|black pine]], [[beech]] and [[fir]] are found on higher mountains and alpine [[grasslands]] grow at elevations above 1800&nbsp;meters.<ref name="cbd.int">http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/al/al-nbsap-01-p1-en.pdf</ref>

The forests are home to a wide range of mammals, including [[Gray wolf|wolves]], bears, [[wild boar]]s and [[chamois]]. [[Lynx]], [[wildcat]]s, [[pine marten]]s and [[European polecat|polecats]] are rare, but survive in some parts of the country.

There are around 760 vertebrate species found so far in Albania. Among these there are over 350 bird species, 330 freshwater and marine fish and 80 mammal species. There are some 91 globally threatened species found within the country, among which the [[Dalmatian pelican]], [[pygmy cormorant]], and the [[European sea sturgeon]]. Rocky coastal regions in the south provide good habitats for the endangered [[Mediterranean monk seal]].

Some of the most significant bird species found in the country include the [[golden eagle]]&nbsp;– known as the national symbol of Albania<ref name="Streissguth"/> &nbsp;– [[vulture]] species, [[capercaillie]] and numerous [[waterfowl]]. The Albanian forests still maintain significant communities of large mammals such as the [[brown bear]], [[gray wolf]], [[chamois]] and [[wild boar]].<ref name="cbd.int"/> The north and eastern mountains of the country are home to the last remaining [[Balkan lynx]]&nbsp;– a critically endangered population of the [[Eurasian lynx]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catsg.org/balkanlynx/20_blx-compendium/index.htm |title=The Balkan Lynx Conservation Compendium|publisher=Catsg.org |accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref>

A large part of Albania's national income comes from tourism. Tourism – {{As of|2013|lc=y}} – funds 10% of its gross domestical product, and this is expected to increase. Albania welcomed around 4.2&nbsp;million visitors in 2012, mostly from neighbouring countries and the [[European Union]]. In 2011, Albania was recommended as a top travel destination, by [[Lonely Planet]].<ref name="Lonely Planet's top 10">{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/albania/travel-tips-and-articles/76164 |title=Lonely Planet's top 10 countries for 2011&nbsp;– travel tips and articles&nbsp;– Lonely Planet |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20101104050258/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/albania/travel-tips-and-articles/76164|archivedate=4 November 2010 |deadurl=no |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> In 2014, Albania was nominated number 4 global touristic destination by the ''[[New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/10/travel/2014-places-to-go.html?_r=0|title=52 Places to Go in 2014 |work=The New York Times|date=5 September 2014}}</ref> The number of tourists has increased by 20% for 2014 as well.

The bulk of the tourist industry is concentrated along the [[Adriatic]] and the [[Ionian Sea]] coast. The latter has the most beautiful and pristine beaches, and is often called the [[Albanian Riviera]]. Albanian seaside has a considerable length of 360&nbsp;km, including even the lagoon area which you find within. The seaside has a particular character because it is rich in varieties of sandy beaches, capes, coves, covered bays, lagoons, small gravel beaches, sea caves etc. Some parts of this seaside are very clean ecologically, which represent in this prospective unexplored areas, very rare in [[Mediterranean]] area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://albania.al/explore/natural-heritage/coast-line |title=Coastline &#124; Visit Albania &#124; The Official website of Albanian Tourism |publisher=Albania.al |accessdate=15 August 2014}}</ref>

The increase in foreign visitors is dramatic, Albania had only 500,000 visitors in 2005, while in 2012 had an estimated 4.2&nbsp;million tourists, an increase of 740% in only 7 years. Several of the country's main cities are situated along the pristine seashores of the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. An important gateway to the [[Balkan Peninsula]], Albania's ever-growing road network provides juncture to reach its neighbors in north south, east, and west. Albania is within close proximity to all the major European capitals with short two- or three-hour flights that are available daily.

== Science and technology ==
{{Main|Science and technology in Albania}}

From 1993 human resources in sciences and technology have drastically decreased. Various surveys show that during 1991–2005, approximately 50% of the professors and research scientists of the universities and science institutions in the country have emigrated.<ref name="dfid">{{cite web|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/R4D/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?OutputID=177440|title=Research for Development|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

However, in 2009 the government approved the "National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation in Albania"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsdc.gov.al/dsdc/pub/national_strategy_of_science_technology_and_innovation_final_draft_381_1.pdf |title=Strategy of Science, Technology and Innovation 2009–2015 |format=PDF |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> covering the period 2009–15. It aims to triple public spending on research and development (R&D) to 0.6% of GDP and augment the share of gross domestic expenditure on R&D from foreign sources, including via the [[European Union]]'s Framework Programmes for Research, to the point where it covers 40% of research spending, among others.

[[File: Autostrada Durrës-Morina-04.jpg|thumb|A1 Highway connecting Albania with Kosovo]]
Currently, there are three main motorways in Albania: the dual carriageway connecting Durrës with [[Vlorë]], the [[Albania–Kosovo Highway]], and the [[Tirana–Elbasan Highway]].

The A1 [[Albania–Kosovo Highway]] links Kosovo to Albania's Adriatic coast: the Albanian side was completed in June 2009,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wynne |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.nce.co.uk/news/transport/albania-motorway-making-the-first-move/5203302.article# |title=Albania highway: Making the first move |publisher=Nce.co.uk |accessdate=29 December 2009}}</ref> and now it takes only two hours and a half to go from the Kosovo border to [[Durrës]]. Overall the highway will be around {{convert|250|km|0|abbr=on}} when it reaches [[Prishtina]]. The project was the biggest and most expensive infrastructure project ever undertaken in Albania. The cost of the highway appears to have breached €800&nbsp; million, although the exact cost for the total highway has yet to be confirmed by the government.

Two additional highways will be built in Albania in the near future: [[Pan-European corridors|Corridor VIII]], which will link Albania with the Republic of Macedonia and Bulgaria, and the north-south highway, which corresponds to the Albanian side of the [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway]], a larger regional highway connecting Croatia with Greece along the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]] coasts. When all three corridors are completed Albania will have an estimated 759&nbsp; kilometers of highway linking it with all its neighboring countries: Kosovo, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, and Greece.

=== Aviation ===
[[File:Terminal jashte.jpg|thumb|[[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]]]]

Aviation in Albania marked it's beginning in March 1926 when German airline Adria Aero Lloyd begin service between Tirana, [[Shkodër]], [[Korçë]] and [[Vlorë]]. On November 2, 1924, the company had obteined monopoly for all domestic rutes. The project proved unprofitable, and Adria Aero Lloyd sold its concession to the Italian company [[Ala Littoria]], which instituted air service in 1935 to several domestic and international destinations.<ref>[https://books.google.pt/books?id=6inIiCF_930C&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=adria+aero+lloyd&source=bl&ots=Q-wc_6y1vs&sig=g6J4y9M4N_bu60p1CD7HH2PvgTc&hl=pt-BR&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjVvo-ilf3MAhUE2RoKHbMbD3UQ6AEIXTAH#v=onepage&q=adria%20aero%20lloyd&f=false Historical Dictionary of Albania] by Robert Elsie, pages 5 and 6</ref> The company, now in Italian hands, expanded its flights to other cities, such as [[Elbasan]], [[Korçë]], [[Kukës]], [[Peshkopi]] and [[Gjirokastër]], and opened up international lines to Rome, [[Milan]], [[Thessaloniki]], [[Sofia]], Belgrade, and [[Podgorica]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The construction of a more modern airport in [[Laprakë]] started in 1934 and was completed by the end of 1935. This new airport, which was later officially named "Airport of Tirana", was constructed in conformity with optimal technological parameters of that time, with a reinforced concrete runway of {{convert|2700|m|0|abbr=on}}, and complemented with technical equipment and appropriate buildings.  In 1938, Yugoslav carrier [[Aeroput]] introduced regular commercial flights linking Tirana with [[Belgrade]] with a landing in [[Dubrovnik]].<ref>[http://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/ Drustvo za Vazdusni Saobracaj A D – Aeroput (1927–1948)] at europeanairlines.no</ref>

During 1955–57, the [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza|Rinasi Airport]] was constructed for military purposes. Later, its administration was shifted to the Ministry of Transport. On 25 January 1957 the State-owned Enterprise of International Air Transport (Albtransport) established its headquarters in Tirana. [[Aeroflot]], [[Jat Airways]], [[Malév]], [[TAROM]] and [[Interflug]] were the air companies that started to have flights with Albania until 1960.<ref name="Tirana International Airport Website">{{cite web |url=http://www.tirana-airport.com/?RoseToken=169180229114147161160144183148154169229193083155156151160214184090168180231crc339 | title=History of the Airport | accessdate=15 January 2011 | publisher=Tirana International Airport Website}}</ref>

During 1960–78, several airlines ceased to operate in Albania due to the self-imposed isolationism of the Communist government under Enver Hoxha, resulting in a decrease of influx of flights and passengers. In 1977 Albania's government signed an agreement with Greece to open the country's first air links with non-communist Europe. As a result, [[Olympic Airlines|Olympic Airways]] was the first non-communist airline to commercially fly into Albania after World War II. By 1991 Albania had air links with many major European cities, including Paris, Rome, [[Zürich]], Vienna and [[Budapest]], but no regular domestic air service.<ref name="Tirana International Airport Website"/>

A French–Albanian joint venture [[Ada Air]], was launched in Albania as the first private airline, in 1991. The company offered flights in a thirty-six-passenger airplane four days a week between Tirana and [[Bari]], Italy and a charter service for domestic and international destinations.<ref name="Tirana International Airport Website"/>

From 1989 to 1991, because of political changes in the Eastern European countries, Albania adhered to the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO), opened its air space to international flights, and had its duties of Air Traffic Control defined. As a result of these developments, conditions were created to separate the activities of air traffic control from Albtransport. Instead, the National Agency of Air Traffic (NATA) was established as an independent enterprise. In addition, during these years, governmental agreements of civil air transport were established with countries such as Bulgaria, Germany, Slovenia, Italy, Russia, Austria, the UK and Macedonia.

The Directory General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) was established on 3 February 1991, to cope with the development required by the time. Albania has one [[international airport]], [[Tirana International Airport Nënë Tereza]], which is linked to 29 destinations by 14 airlines. It has seen a dramatic rise in passenger numbers and aircraft movements since the early 1990s.

'''Kukës Airport'''

The government of Albania granted permission for it to host international passenger traffic in 2016.

=== Railways ===
{{Main|Rail transport in Albania|Hekurudha Shqiptare}}

[[File:Albanian Railways T-669 Locomotive.JPG|thumb|Newly painted T-669 Locomotive of the Albanian Railways at Kashar transit stop]]

The railways in Albania are administered by the national railway company ''[[Hekurudha Shqiptare]]'' (HSH) (which means ''Albanian Railways''). It operates a {{RailGauge|1435 mm}} gauge (standard gauge) rail system in Albania. All trains are hauled by Czech-built [[ČKD]] [[diesel-electric locomotive]]s.

The railway system was extensively promoted by the [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime of [[Enver Hoxha]], during which time the use of private transport was effectively prohibited. Since the collapse of the former regime, there has been a considerable increase in car ownership and bus usage. Whilst some of the country's roads are still in very poor condition, there have been other developments (such as the construction of a motorway between Tirana and Durrës) which have taken much traffic away from the railways.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Albanians are considered a polyglot nation and people. Due to immigration and past colonialism, Albanians generally speak more than 2 languages. English, Italian and Greek are by far the most widely spoken foreign languages, which are increasing due to migration return, and new Greek and Italian communities in the country. La Francophonie states 320,000 French speakers can be found in Albania. Other spoken languages include Serbian, Romanian, German, Turkish and Aromanian. Albanians in neighbouring Kosovo and Macedonia are often fluent in Albanian and Serbian, Turkish, Slavic Macedonian, and other former Yugoslav languages.

According to the 2011 population census, 2,765,610 or 98.767% of the population declared [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as their mother tongue ("mother tongue is defined as the first or main language spoken at home during childhood").<ref name="Population and Housing Census 2011"/>

The Albanians first appeared in the historical record in [[Byzantine]] sources of the late 11th century. At this point, they were already fully Christianized. [[Islam]] came first time in the 9th century to the region which is known as Albania today.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Jørgen Nielsen |author2=Samim Akgönül |author3=Ahmet Alibašić |author4=Egdunas Racius |title=Yearbook of Muslims in Europe|chapter=Albania|page=23|volume=5|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ia5AAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA351&lpg=PA351&dq=yearbook+islam+europa+albania&source=bl&ots=NfP5NcIwYX&sig=VvUvHqlH8VrkDQyN-CUgs0UweoA&hl=de&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjFgv7GkbzLAhWCBSwKHXbmABAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=albania&f=false|accessdate=2016-03-12|publisher=Brill|year=2013|location=Leiden, Boston, New York}}</ref> It later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories.

The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely [[anti-religious|banned religion]] to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first [[state atheism|atheist state]]. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the [[Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership.<ref name="Mejdini">{{cite news|url=http://gazeta-shqip.com/lajme/2014/02/17/shqiperia-refuzon-organizaten-islamike-jo-pjese-e-aktivitetit-ne-teheran/|title=Shqipëria refuzon Organizatën Islamike, jo pjesë e aktivitetit në Teheran|last=Mejdini|first=Fatjona|date=17 February 2014|publisher=Shqip|language=Albanian|accessdate=10 May 2014}}</ref> Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the [[Sunni]] branch) are found throughout the country whereas [[Albanian Orthodox Church|Albanian Orthodox Christians]] as well as [[Bektashi]]s are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country.<ref name="International Religious Freedom Report 2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm |title=Albania: International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=State.gov|date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=27 August 2010| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20100828091818/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90160.htm| archivedate= 28 August 2010 |deadurl= no}}</ref>

He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania. The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.

[[File:Kole Idromeno, Motra tone.jpg|thumb|''[[Motra Tone]]'' by [[Kolë Idromeno]]|299x299px]]Albanian art has a long and eventful history. Albania, a country of southeastern Europe, has a unique culture from that of other European countries. The Ottoman Empire ruled over Albania for nearly five centuries, which greatly affected the country's artwork and artistic forms. After Albania's joining with the Ottoman Empire in 1478, Ottoman influenced art forms such as mosaics and muralpaintings became prevalent, and no real artistic change occurred until Albanian Liberation in 1912.

Following mosaics and murals of antiquity and the Middle Ages, the first paintings were icons Byzantine Orthodox tradition. Albanian earliest icons date from the late thirteenth century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the eighteenth century. Among the most prominent representatives of the Albanian iconographic art were Onufri and David Selenica. The museums of Berat, Korca and Tirana good collections remaining icons. By the end of the Ottoman period, the painting was limited mostly to folk art and ornate mosques.<ref name="www.albanianart.net index_al">{{Cite web|title = Robert Elsie: Arti Shqiptar|url = http://www.albanianart.net/index_al.html|website = www.albanianart.net|accessdate = 2015-11-22}}</ref>

Paintings and sculpture arose in the first half of the twentieth century and reached a modest peak in the 1930s and 1940s, when the first organized art exhibitions at national level.<ref name="www.albanianart.net index_al"/> Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message. Albanian artists continue to move art forward, while their art still remains distinctively Albanian in content. Though among Albanian artist post-modernism was fairly recently introduced, there is a number of artists and works known internationally. Among most famous Albanian post-modernist are considered [[Anri Sala]], [[Sislej Xhafa]], and [[Helidon Gjergji]].

=== Music and folklore ===
{{Main|Music of Albania|Albanian traditional clothing}}
[[File:Albanian Peasants costumes.jpg|thumb|Albanian Peasants costumes – illustration by Percy Anderson for Costume Fanciful, Historical and Theatrical, 1906]]

Albanian folk music falls into three stylistic groups, with other important [[music area]]s around [[Shkodër]] and [[Tirana]]; the major groupings are the [[Gheg]]s of the north and southern Labs and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosks]]. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the "rugged and heroic" tone of the north and the "relaxed" form of the south.Southern instrumental music includes the sedate kaba, an ensemble-driven by a clarinet or violin alongside accordions and llautës. The kaba is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as "both fresh and ancient", "ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality", exemplifying the "combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture."

These disparate styles are unified by "the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of [[oral history]]", as well as certain characteristics like the use of rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.<ref>Arbatsky, Yuri, cited in Koco with the footnote ''Translated and published by Filip Fishta in Shkolla Kombëtare (The National School; No.1, May 1939), 19, and quoted from his Preface to [[Pjetër Dungu]]'s Lyra Shqiptare (see note 2).''</ref> The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by [[Pjetër Dungu]] in 1940.

Albanian folk songs can be divided into major groups, the heroic epics of the north, and the sweetly melodic lullabies, love songs, wedding music, work songs and other kinds of song. The music of various festivals and holidays is also an important part of Albanian folk song, especially those that celebrate St. Lazarus Day, which inaugurates the springtime. Lullabies and [[vajtim]]s are very important kinds of Albanian folk song, and are generally performed by solo women.<ref name="koco">{{cite web|title=Albanian Music|work=Eno Koco at the University of Leeds|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/staff/ek/|accessdate=28 August 2005| archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20050828104120/http://www.leeds.ac.uk/music/staff/ek/| archivedate= 28 August 2005 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Albanian was proved to be an [[Indo-European language]] in 1854 by the German [[Comparative linguistics|philologist]] [[Franz Bopp]]. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family.

Most scholars argue that Albanian derives from [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]]<ref>Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture By J. P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams Edition: illustrated Published by Taylor & Francis, 1997 ISBN 978-1-884964-98-5, ISBN 978-1-884964-98-5 (''"Although there are some lexical items that appear to be shared between Romanian (and by extension Dacian) and Albanian, by far the strongest connections can be argued between Albanian and Illyrian."'' page 11)

It is often held to be related to Illyrian, a poorly attested language spoken in the Western Balkans in classical times"'' page 22)</ref> while some others<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=txh|title=The Thracian language|publisher=The Linguist List|accessdate=27 January 2008|quote=An ancient language of Southern Balkans, belonging to the Satem group of Indo-European.

(Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see [[Thraco-Illyrian]].)

''[[Meshari]]Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of [[isogloss]]es with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long ''o'' has fallen to ''a'', much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative ''jos'' and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives.

The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language what [[Martin Luther|Luther]] did for German.

'' (The Missal) by [[Gjon Buzuku]], published in 1555, is considered the first literary work of written Albanian. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.

[[File:Naim Frasheri.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Pantheist and Romanticist writer [[Naim Frasheri]]]]The earliest evidence dates from 1332&nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pagëzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durrës]], [[Pal Engjëlli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.

Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who, in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book|''Rrethimi i Shkodrës'' (The Siege of Shkodër)]] (1504), confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'') as well as his famous biography of Skanderbeg [[Marin Barleti|''Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis'' (History of Skanderbeg)]] (1508).The History of Skanderbeg is still the foundation of Scanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.

During the 16th to 17th centuries, the [[catechism]] ''E mbësuame krishterë'' (Christian Teachings) (1592) by [[Lekë Matrënga]], ''Doktrina e krishterë'' (The Christian Doctrine) (1618) and ''Rituale romanum'' (1621) by [[Pjetër Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[prose]] and poetry, an [[Remorse|apology]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty ''[[Cuneus Prophetarum]]'' (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjetër Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The most famous Albanian writer is probably [[Ismail Kadare]].

== Education ==
[[File:Tirana University (April 2014).jpg|thumb|[[University of Tirana]] was established in 1957]]
{{Main|Education in Albania}}

Before the establishment of the [[People's Republic]], Albania's illiteracy rate was as high as 85%. Schools were scarce between [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. When the People's Republic was established in 1945, the [[Party of Labour of Albania|Party]] gave high priority to wiping out illiteracy. As part of a vast social campaign, anyone between the ages of 12 and 40 who could not read or write was mandated to attend classes to learn. By 1955, illiteracy was virtually eliminated among Albania's adult population.<ref>Zickel, Iwaskiw, 1994</ref>

Today the overall literacy rate in Albania is 98.7%; the male [[literacy rate]] is 99.2% and female literacy rate is 98.3%.<ref name="cia"/> With large population movements in the 1990s to urban areas, the provision of education has undergone transformation as well. The [[University of Tirana]] is the oldest university in Albania, having been founded in October 1957.

The international television service [[satellite|via satellite]] was launched since 1993 and aims at [[Albanian language|Albanian]] communities in Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and northern Greece, plus the Albanian [[diaspora]] in the rest of Europe. RTSH has a past of being heavily influenced by the ruling party in its reporting, whether that party be left or right wing.

According to the Albanian Media Authority, AMA, Albania has an estimated 257 media outlets, including 66 radio stations and 67 television stations, with three national, 62 local and more than 50 cable TV stations.
Last years Albania has organized several shows as a part of worldwide series like ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', ''[[Big Brother Albania]]'', ''[[Albanians Got Talent]]'', ''[[The Voice of Albania]]'', and ''[[X Factor (Albanian TV series)|X Factor Albania]]''.

The general improvement of health conditions in the country is reflected in the lower mortality rate, down to an estimated 6.49 deaths per 1,000 in 2000, as compared with 17.8 per 1,000 in 1938. In 2000, average life expectancy was estimated at 74 years, compared to 38 years at the end of World War II. Albania's infant mortality rate, estimated at 20 per 1,000 live births in 2000, has also declined over the years since the high rate of 151 per 1,000 live births in 1960. There were 69,802 births in 1999 and the fertility rate in 1999 was 2.5 while the maternal mortality rate was 65 per 100,000 live births in 1993. In addition, in 1997, Albania had high immunization rates for children up to one year old: tuberculosis at 94%; diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus, 99%; measles, 95%; and polio, 99.5%. In 1996, the incidence of tuberculosis was 23 in 100,000 people. In 1995 there were two reported cases of AIDS and seven cases in 1996.

{{Main|Albanian cuisine}}

The cuisine of Albania&nbsp;– as with most [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkans|Balkan]] nations&nbsp;– is strongly influenced by its long history. At different times, the territory which is now Albania has been claimed or occupied by Greece, Serbia, Italy and the [[Ottoman Turk]]s and each group has left its mark on Albanian cuisine. The main meal of [[Albanians]] is the midday meal, which is usually accompanied by a [[salad]] of fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, green [[bell pepper|peppers]] and [[olive]]s with [[olive oil]], vinegar and salt. It also includes a main dish of vegetables and meat. Seafood specialties are also common in the coastal cities of [[Durrës]], [[Sarandë]] and [[Vlorë]]. In high elevation localities, smoked meat and pickled preserves are common.
