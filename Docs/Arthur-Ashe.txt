'''Arthur Robert Ashe, Jr.''' (July 10, 1943&nbsp;– February 6, 1993) was an American [[World-number-one male tennis-player rankings|World No. 1]] professional [[tennis]] player. He won three [[Grand Slam title]]s, ranking him among the best tennis players from the United States.

Ashe was the first black player selected to the [[United States Davis Cup team]] and the only black man ever to win the singles title at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]], or the [[Australian Open]]. He retired in 1980. He was ranked World No. 1 by [[Harry Hopman]] in 1968 and by [[Lance Tingay]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''World Tennis Magazine'' in 1975.<ref name="ToledoBlade1968"/><ref name="Lewiston1975">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U2MgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=EWYFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4944,1369860&dq=no+1+world+rankings+arthur+ashe+1975&hl=en "Ashe Ranked 1"], ''The Lewiston Daily Sun'', December 9, 1975.</ref> In the ATP computer rankings, he peaked at No. 2 in May 1976.<ref>[http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/arthur-ashe/a063/overview ATP profile of Arthur Ashe]</ref>

In the early 1980s, Ashe is believed to have contracted [[HIV]] from a blood transfusion he received during [[heart bypass surgery]].  Ashe publicly announced his illness in April 1992 and began working to educate others about HIV and AIDS. He founded the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS and the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health before his death from [[AIDS]]-related [[pneumonia]] on February 6, 1993.

On June 20, 1993, Ashe was posthumously awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by then United States President [[Bill Clinton]].

==Early life==
Arthur Ashe was born in [[Richmond, Virginia]], to Arthur Ashe Sr. and Mattie Cordell Cunningham Ashe on July 10, 1943. He had a brother, Johnnie, who was five years younger.<ref name="moore">{{cite web|url=http://www.si.com/vault/1992/12/21/127803/sportsman-of-the-year-the-eternal-example-arthur-ashe-epitomizes-good-works-devotion-to-family-and-unwavering-grace-under-pressure|title=The Eternal Example|last=Moore|first=Kenny|date=December 21, 1992|publisher=sportsillustrated.cnn.com|page=2|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref> In March 1950, Ashe's mother Mattie died from complications related to a toxemic pregnancy (now known as [[pre-eclampsia]]) at the age of 27.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ashe|first1=Arthur |last2=Rampersad|first2=Arnold |title=Days of Grace|year=1994|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=0-345-38681-7|page=58}}</ref> Ashe and his brother were raised by their father who worked as a handyman and salaried caretaker-Special Policeman for Richmond's recreation department.<ref name="moore" />

Ashe Sr. was a caring father and strict disciplinarian who encouraged Arthur to excel in both school and in sports, but forbade him to play [[American football]], a popular game for many black children, due to his son's slight build, something that meant Arthur's childhood nicknames were "Skinny" or "Bones". The Ashes lived in the caretaker's cottage in the grounds of 18-acre Brookfield park, Richmond's largest blacks-only public playground, which had basketball courts, four tennis courts, a pool and three baseball diamonds. Ashe started playing tennis at 7 years of age and began practicing on the courts where his natural talent was spotted by [[Virginia Union University]] student and part-time Brookfield tennis instructor, Ron Charity, who as the best black tennis player in Richmond at the time, began to teach Ashe the basic strokes and encouraged him to enter local tournaments.

Ashe attended [[Maggie L. Walker High School]] where he continued to practice tennis. Ron Charity brought him to the attention of [[Robert Walter Johnson]], a physician, and coach of [[Althea Gibson]], who founded and funded the Junior Development Program of the [[American Tennis Association]] (ATA). Ashe was coached and mentored by Johnson at his tennis summer camp home in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] from 1953 when Ashe was age 10, until 1960. Johnson helped fine-tune Ashe's game and taught him the importance of [[Socialization|racial socialization]] through [[sportsmanship]], [[etiquette]] and the composure that would later become an Ashe hallmark. He was told to return every ball that landed within two inches of a line and never to argue with an umpire's decision. In 1958, Ashe became the first African-American to play in the Maryland boys' championships. It was also his first integrated tennis competition.

In 1960, precluded from playing [[White people|Caucasian]] youths in segregated Richmond during the school year and unable to use the city's indoor courts which were closed to black players, Ashe accepted an offer from Richard Hudlin, a 62-year-old [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] teacher, tennis coach and friend of Dr. Johnson, to move to St. Louis and spend his senior year attending [[Sumner High School (St. Louis)|Sumner High School]]<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DC1331F933A25756C0A964958260 "TRAVEL ADVISORY; Black History in St. Louis"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 10, 1992. Accessed December 11, 2007. "Sumner High School, the first school west of the [[Mississippi]] for blacks, established in 1875 (among graduates are [[Grace Bumbry]], Arthur Ashe, and [[Tina Turner]])..."</ref> where he could compete more freely. Ashe lived with Hudlin and his family for the year, during which time Hudlin coached and encouraged him to develop the [[serve-and-volley]] game that Ashe's, now stronger, physique allowed. Ashe was able to practice at the National Guard Armory indoor courts and in 1961, after lobbying by Dr. Johnson, he was granted permission to compete in the previously segregated U.S. Interscholastic tournament and won it for the school.

In December 1960 and again in 1963, Ashe featured in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', appearing in their [[Faces in the Crowd (Sports Illustrated)|Faces in the Crowd]] segment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.si.com/more-sports/photos/2010/08/24si-cover-history-august-23-29#5|title=SI Cover History: August 23–29|author=Daniel Schwartz/SI|work=SI.com}}</ref> He became the first African-American to win the National Junior Indoor tennis title and was awarded a tennis scholarship to the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) in 1963. During his time at UCLA, he was coached by [[J.D. Morgan]] and practiced regularly with his sporting idol, [[Pancho Gonzales]], who lived nearby and helped hone his game. Ashe was also a member of the [[ROTC]] which required him to join active military service after graduation in exchange for money for tuition. He was active in other things, joining the Upsilon chapter of the [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity on campus. After graduating with a bachelor's degree in business administration, Ashe joined the [[United States Army]] on August 4, 1966. Ashe completed his basic training in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and was later commissioned as a [[second lieutenant]] in the Adjutant General Corps. He was assigned to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point where he worked as a data processor. During his time at West Point, Ashe headed the academy's tennis program. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant on February 23, 1968 and was discharged from the Army in 1969.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steins|first=Richard |title=Arthur Ashe: A Biography|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-33299-1|pages=22–23}}</ref><ref>Army Register, 1969.  Vol. 2. pg. 32.</ref>

==Career==
In 1963 Ashe became the first black player ever selected for the [[United States Davis Cup team]]. In 1965, ranked the number 3 player in the United States, Ashe won both the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) singles title and the doubles title (with [[Ian Crookenden]] of New Zealand), helping UCLA win the team NCAA tennis championship.

In 1966 and 1967, Ashe reached the final of the Australian Championship but lost on both occasions to [[Roy Emerson]].

1968 was another groundbreaking year for Ashe. He won the [[United States Amateur Championships (tennis)|United States Amateur Championships]] against Davis Cup Teammate Bob Lutz, and the first [[1968 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] of the [[History of tennis#Open Era|open era]], becoming the first black male to capture the title and the only player to have won both the amateur and open national championships in the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tennisfame.com/hall-of-famers/inductees/arthur-ashe |title=Arthur Robert Ashe, Jr. |publisher=TennisFame.com }}</ref> In order to maintain Davis Cup eligibility and have time away from army duty for important tournaments, Ashe was required to maintain his amateur status. Because of this, he could not accept the $14,000 first-prize money, which was instead given to runner-up [[Tom Okker]],<ref name=collins>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Bud|title=The Bud Collins History of Tennis|year=2010|publisher=New Chapter Press|location=[New York]|isbn=978-0942257700|page=145|edition=2nd}}</ref> while Ashe received just $20 daily expenses for his historic triumph. His ability to compete in the championship (and avoid the Vietnam war) arose from his brother Johnnie's decision to serve an additional tour in Vietnam in Arthur's place.<ref>{{cite web|title=30 for 30 Shorts: 'Arthur & Johnnie'|url=http://grantland.com/features/our-latest-30-30-documentary-short-examines-how-johnnie-love-brother-arthur-changed-their-lives-tennis-history/|publisher=Grantland|date=August 28, 2013}}</ref>  In December 1968, Ashe helped the U.S team become Davis Cup champions after victory in the final in [[Adelaide]] against defending champions, Australia. His only loss in the 12 Davis Cup tournament singles matches he played that year, was in the last [[dead rubber]] game after the U.S team had already clinched victory. The season closed with Ashe the winner of 10 of 22 tournaments with a 72-10 win-loss match record.

In September 1969, the U.S Davis Cup team retained the cup, beating [[Romania]] in the final challenge round, with Ashe winning both his singles matches. The same year, Ashe applied for a visa to play in the [[South African Open (tennis)|South African Open]] but was denied the visa by the [[South Africa]]n government who enforced a strict [[apartheid]] policy of racial segregation. He continued to apply for visas in the following years and the country continued to deny him one. In protest, he used this example of discrimination to campaign for U.S. [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] against South Africa and the expulsion of the nation from the International Lawn Tennis Federation ([[International Tennis Federation|ILTF]]) but, in defense of the individual South African players, refused the call from activists to forfeit matches against them.

In January 1970, Ashe won his second [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] singles title at the [[1970 Australian Open|Australian Open]]. With the competition somewhat depleted by the absence of some world-class [[National Tennis League]] (NTL) professional players barred by their league from entering because the financial guarantees were deemed too low, Ashe defeated [[Dick Crealy]] in straight sets in the final to become the first non-Australian to win the title since 1959. In September 1970, shortly after helping the U.S Davis cup team defeat [[West Germany]] in the challenge round to win their third consecutive Davis Cup, Ashe signed a five-year contract with [[Lamar Hunt]]'s [[World Championship Tennis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ashe signs 5-year professional contract|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4NhFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1r0MAAAAIBAJ&dq=lamar%20hunt%20tennis&pg=6071%2C4381773|newspaper=The Telegraph-Herald|date=September 16, 1970}}</ref>

In March 1971, Ashe reached the final of the Australian Open again but lost in straight sets to [[Ken Rosewall]]. In June that year, Ashe won the [[French Open]] men's doubles with partner [[Marty Riessen]].

In 1972, due to a dispute between the [[International Tennis Federation|ILTF]] and the WCT, Ashe, as one of the 32 contracted WCT players, was barred from taking part in any ILTF [[Grand Prix tennis circuit]] tournaments from January to July. This ban meant Ashe was unable to play at the French Open and [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] [[Grand Slam (Tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournaments. In September, Ashe reached the final of the US Open for the second time. After leading his opponent, [[Ilie Năstase]] by 2 sets to 1 and with a break point to take a 4-1 lead in the fourth set, he eventually lost in five sets. The loss from such a winning position was the biggest disappointment of Ashe's professional tennis career. At the post-match award ceremony, irritated by some of Năstase's on-court antics during the game, Ashe praised Năstase as a tough opponent and 'colourful' player, then suggested, "...and when he brushes up on some of his court manners, he is going to be even better". At this tournament, concerned that men's tennis professionals were not receiving winnings commensurate with the sport's growing popularity and to protect players from promoters and associations, Ashe supported the founding of the [[Association of Tennis Professionals]]. He went on to become its elected president in 1974.

In June 1973, as a result of an ATP boycott, Ashe was one of 13 seeded players and 81 players in total who withdrew from the [[1973 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]] tournament to much public criticism. The catalyst for the boycott was that [[Yugoslavia]]n ATP member [[Nikola Pilić|Niki Pilić]] had been suspended for nine months by his tennis federation after allegedly refusing to represent them in a Davis Cup tie against New Zealand in May, something Pilić denied. The ban was upheld by the ILTF though they reduced it to just one month. The ATP contested the ban but lost a lawsuit to force Pilić's participation at Wimbledon during the ban period. As a member of the ATP board, Ashe voted to boycott the tournament, a vote that was only narrowly passed when ATP chairman, [[Cliff Drysdale]] abstained. The reason for the boycott was to support Pilić as an ATP member, but the importance was that it proved the solidarity of the fledgling ATP, and showed the tennis associations that professional players could no longer be dictated to.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Kamakshi Tandon|title=It all changed in 1973 for the ATP|url=http://espn.go.com/tennis/wimbledon13/story/_/id/9436082/wimbledon-tandon-all-changed-1973|website=espn.go.com|publisher=ESPN|date=July 1, 2013}}</ref>

In November 1973, with the South African government seeking to end their [[Apartheid-era South Africa and the Olympics|Olympic ban]] and re-join the Olympic movement, Ashe was finally granted a visa to enter the country for the first time to play in the South African Open. He lost in the final to [[Jimmy Connors]], but won the doubles with partner Tom Okker. Despite boycotts against South African sport, Ashe believed that his presence could help break down stereotypes and that by competing and winning the tournament, it would stand as an example of the result of integration, and help bring about change in apartheid South Africa. He reached the singles final again in 1974, losing in straight sets to Connors for the second consecutive year. Later, in 1977, Ashe addressed a small crowd of boycott supporters at the U.S Open and admitted that he had been wrong to participate in South Africa and once again supported the boycott of South African players after he had tried to purchase tickets for some young Africans for a tennis match in South Africa, and was told to use an "Africans only" counter.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Richard E. Lapchick|title=A legacy of change and hope|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/tennis/columns/misc/1503082.html|publisher=ESPN}}</ref> In the media, Ashe called for South Africa to be expelled from the professional tennis circuit and Davis Cup competition.

In May 1975, Ashe beat [[Bjorn Borg]] to win the season-ending championship [[WCT Finals]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].

On July 5, 1975 in the first all-American Wimbledon final since 1947, Ashe, seeded sixth and just a few days short of his 32nd birthday, won [[1975 Wimbledon Championships – Men's Singles|Wimbledon]] at his ninth attempt, defeating the strong favourite and defending champion, Jimmy Connors. Ashe had never beaten Connors in any of their previous encounters and Connors had not dropped a set in any of the six earlier rounds, but Ashe played an almost perfect game of tactical tennis to win in four sets.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ashe Wins Wimbledon Crown|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sIYsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_cwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5680%2C791502|work=Herald-Journal|agency=AP|date=July 6, 1975}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Fred Tupper|title=Ashe Thrashes Connors For Wimbledon Title|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=37wqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=A2cEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6619%2C2196671|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|publisher=N.Y. Times|date=July 6, 1975}}</ref> In the lead-up to the final, the two players' relationship was already strained. Connors was suing the ATP, with Ashe as its president, for alleged [[restraint of trade]] after opposition from the ATP and French officials meant he was refused entry to the 1974 French Open as a contracted member of [[World Team Tennis]] (WTT). Just two days before the start of the Wimbledon tournament, it had been announced that Connors was now suing Ashe for $5 million for comments in a letter Ashe had written to ATP members in his role as president, criticizing Connors' insistence that Davis Cup captain [[Dennis Ralston]] should be fired and Connors' "unpatriotic" boycott of the competition which had started after Ralston left him out of the team against the [[Caribbean/West Indies Davis Cup team|West Indies]] in [[Jamaica]] in March 1972. On final day, Ashe pointedly and symbolically wore red, white and blue wristbands throughout the match and wore his U.S.A. emblazoned Davis Cup warm-up jacket when walking out onto [[Centre Court]] and during the award ceremony while receiving the trophy and winner's cheque for GBP £10,000 (1975 equivalent USD $23,000). Soon after the final, Connors dropped the libel suit.

Ashe played for a few more years and won the Australian Open doubles with [[Tony Roche]] in January 1977, but a left foot heel injury requiring surgery a month later and subsequent long-term rehabilitation saw his world ranking drop to a lowly 257th before a remarkable comeback saw him rise back to 14th in the world again at the age of 35. However, after undergoing [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]] in December 1979, Ashe officially retired in April 1980, at age 36. His career record was 818 wins, 260 losses and 51 titles.

[[File:C9186-21Reagan-Ashe.jpg|thumb|President Reagan greets Arthur Ashe (left) in 1982]]

Ashe remains the only black man to win the singles title at Wimbledon, the US Open, or Australian Open. He is one of only two men of [[Black people|black]] African ancestry to win any Grand Slam singles title, the other being France's [[Yannick Noah]], who won the French Open in 1983. He also led the United States to victory for three consecutive years (1968–70) in the Davis Cup.

In his 1979 autobiography, [[Jack Kramer]], the long-time tennis promoter and a world no. 1 player himself in the 1940s, ranked Ashe as one of the 21 best players of all time.<ref>Kramer considered the best ever to have been either [[Don Budge]] (for consistent play) or [[Ellsworth Vines]] (at the height of his game). The next four best were, chronologically, [[Bill Tilden]], [[Fred Perry]], [[Ronald

Thorpe]], and [[Pancho Gonzales]]. After these six came the "second echelon" of [[Rod Laver]], [[Lew Hoad]], [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Gottfried von Cramm]], [[Ted Schroeder]], [[Jack Crawford (tennis player)|Jack Crawford]], [[Pancho Segura]], [[Frank Sedgman]], [[Tony Trabert]], [[John Newcombe]], Arthur Ashe, [[Stan Smith]], [[Björn Borg]], and [[Jimmy Connors]]. Kramer felt unable to rank [[Henri Cochet]] and [[René Lacoste]] accurately but felt they were among the very best.</ref>

==Retirement==
After his retirement, Ashe took on many roles, including writing for ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine and [[The Washington Post]], commentating for [[ABC Sports]], founding the National Junior Tennis League, and serving as captain of the U.S. Davis Cup team from 1981-1985. He was elected to the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmgww.com/sports/ashe/about/bio2.htm |title=Arthur Ashe Biography |publisher=CMG WorldWide |accessdate=September 9, 2009}}</ref>

In 1988, Ashe published a three-volume book titled ''A Hard Road to Glory: A History of the African-American Athlete'',<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/sports/views-of-sport-taking-the-hard-road-with-black-athletes.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=Views of Sport; Taking the Hard Road with Black Athletes |last=Ashe, Jr. |first=Arthur R. |date=November 13, 1988 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}</ref> after working with a team of researchers for nearly six years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1sQwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CvwDAAAAIBAJ&dq=arthur-ashe%20hard-road-to-glory&pg=4953%2C7510747 |title=Their Hard Road to Glory |last=Kupferberg |first=Herbert |date=March 12, 1989 |work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]] |pages=12 |accessdate=May 27, 2012}}</ref> Ashe stated that the book was more important than any tennis titles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Book Review: 'Arthur Ashe' by Eric Allen Hall|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/book-review-arthur-ashe-by-eric-allen-hall-1409348393|website=online.wsj.com|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=August 29, 2014|author=Michael O'Donnell}}</ref>

Ashe was also an active civil rights supporter. He was a member of a delegation of 31 prominent [[African-Americans]] who visited South Africa to observe political change in the country as it approached racial integration. He was arrested on January 11, 1985, for protesting outside the [[Embassy of South Africa, Washington, D.C.]] during an anti-[[apartheid]] rally. He was arrested again on September 9, 1992, outside the [[White House]] for protesting on the recent crackdown on [[Haitian people|Haitian]] refugees.

==Personal life==
On February 20, 1977, Ashe married Jeanne Moutoussamy, a photographer he met in October 1976 at a [[United Negro College Fund]] benefit. [[Andrew Young]], the [[United States Ambassador to the United Nations]], performed the wedding ceremony in the United Nations chapel, New York City.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ashe|first=Arthur|date=August 1981|title=My Introduction To Sex, Love and Marriage|journal=Ebony|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=36|issue=10|pages=86, 90|issn=0012-9011}} Young served as a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in the [[United Church of Christ]].</ref>  During the ceremony Ashe wore a cast on his left foot having had an operation on an injured heel ten days earlier.

In December 1986, Ashe and Moutoussamy adopted a daughter. She was named Camera after her mother's profession.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steins|first=Richard |title=Arthur Ashe: A Biography|year=2005|publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]|isbn=0-313-33299-1|pages=66}}</ref>

In March 1989 Ashe's father died of a stroke at age 68.

===Health issues===
[[File:Arthur Ashe c-00619.jpg|right|thumb|Ashe promoting heart health after his heart attack.]]

In July 1979, Ashe suffered a heart attack while holding a tennis clinic in New York. In view of his high level of fitness as an athlete, his condition drew attention to the hereditary aspect of heart disease; Ashe's mother already had [[cardiovascular disease]] at the time of her death, aged 27, and his father had suffered a first heart attack, aged 55, and a second, aged 59, just a week before Ashe's own attack. [[Cardiac catheterization]] revealed one of Ashe's arteries was completely closed, another was 95 percent closed, and a third was closed 50 percent in two places. Ashe underwent a quadruple [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypass]] operation, performed by Dr. John Hutchinson on December 13, 1979.<ref name=DoG>{{cite book |title= Days of Grace: A Memoir |last= Rampersad |first= Arnold |author2= Arthur Ashe |year= 1993 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location= New York |isbn= 0-679-42396-6 |page= 35}}</ref> A few months after the operation, Ashe was on the verge of making his return to professional tennis. However, during a family trip in [[Cairo, Egypt]], he developed chest pains while running. Ashe stopped running and returned to see a physician and was accompanied by his close friend Douglas Stein. Stein urged Ashe to return to New York City so he could be close to his cardiologist, his surgeon and top-class medical facilities.<ref name=DoG /> In 1983, Ashe underwent a second round of heart surgery to correct the previous bypass surgery. After the surgery, Ashe became national campaign chairman for the American Heart Association.

In September 1988, Ashe was hospitalized after experiencing paralysis in his right arm. After undergoing exploratory brain surgery and a number of tests, doctors discovered that Ashe had [[toxoplasmosis]], a [[parasitic disease]] that is commonly found in people infected with [[HIV]]. A subsequent test later revealed that Ashe was HIV positive. Ashe and his doctors believed he contracted the virus from [[blood transfusion]]s he received during his second heart surgery.<ref name=sankaran>{{cite book|last1=Sankaran|first1=Gopal |last2=Volkwein-Caplan|first2=Karin A.

He and his wife decided to keep his illness private for the sake of their daughter, who was then two years old.

In 1992, a friend of Ashe's who worked for ''[[USA Today]]'' heard that he was ill and called Ashe to confirm the story. Ashe decided to preempt ''USA Today'''s plans to publish the story about his illness and, on April 8, 1992, publicly announced he had contracted HIV. Ashe blamed ''USA Today'' for forcing him to go public with the news but also stated that he was relieved that he no longer had to lie about his illness. After the announcement, hundreds of readers called or wrote letters to ''USA Today'' criticizing their choice to run the story about Ashe's illness which subsequently forced Ashe to publicize his illness.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sankaran|first1=Gopal |last2=Volkwein-Caplan|first2=Karin A.

After Ashe went public with his illness, he founded the Arthur Ashe Foundation for the Defeat of AIDS, working to raise awareness about the virus and advocated teaching [[sex education]] and [[safe sex]]. He also fielded questions about his own diagnosis and attempted to clear up the misconception that only homosexuals or IV drug users were at risk for contracting AIDS.<ref name=sankaran /> In September 1992, Ashe suffered a mild heart attack. In a speech to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on [[World AIDS Day]], December 1, 1992, he addressed the growing need for AIDS awareness and increased research funding saying "We want to be able to look back and say to all concerned that we did what we had to do, when we had to do it, and with all the resources required."

Two months before his death, he founded the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health to help address issues of inadequate health care delivery and was named ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's [[Sportsman of the Year]]. He also spent much of the last years of his life writing his [[memoir]] ''Days of Grace'', finishing the [[manuscript]] less than a week before his death.

==Death==
On February 6, 1993, Ashe died from [[AIDS-related pneumonia]] at [[New York Hospital]]. His funeral was held at the [[Arthur Ashe Athletic Center]] in Richmond, Virginia, on February 10.<ref name="nytimes" /> Then-governor [[Douglas Wilder]], who was a friend of Ashe's, allowed his body to [[lie in state]] at the [[Executive Mansion (Virginia)|Governor's Mansion]] in Richmond. More than 5,000 people lined up to walk past the casket. Andrew Young, who had performed the service for Ashe's wedding in 1977, officiated at his funeral. Over 6,000 mourners attended.<ref>{{cite journal|date=March 1, 1993|title=Friends and Fans Say Farewell to Arthur Ashe|journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|publisher=[[Johnson Publishing Company]]|volume=83|issue=18|pages=12–18|issn=0021-5996}}</ref> Ashe requested that he be buried alongside his mother, Mattie, who died in 1950, in [[Woodland Cemetery (Richmond, Virginia)|Woodland Cemetery]] in Richmond, Virginia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_OYyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=vgcGAAAAIBAJ&pg=4123,749050&dq=arthur+ashe+mattie&hl=en|title=Richmond still searching for way to honor Ashe|last=Macenka|first=Joe|date=February 4, 1995|work=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|page=B1|accessdate=December 4, 2012}}</ref>

*In 1979, Arthur Ashe was inducted into the [[Virginia Sports Hall of Fame]]. In commenting on his induction, the Hall noted that, "Arthur Ashe was certainly a hero to people of all ages and races, and his legacy continues to touch the lives of many today. For Arthur Ashe, tennis was a means to an end. Although he had a lucrative tennis career, it was always more than personal glory and individual accolades. He used his status as an elite tennis player to speak out against the moral inequalities that existed both in and out of the tennis world. Ashe sincerely wanted to bring about change in the world.
