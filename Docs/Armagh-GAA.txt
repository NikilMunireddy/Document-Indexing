The Armagh County Board of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) ({{lang-ga|Cumann Lúthchleas Gael Coiste Chontae Ard Mhacha}}) or '''Armagh GAA''' is one of the 32 [[GAA county|county boards]] of the GAA in [[Ireland]], and is responsible for [[Gaelic games]] in [[County Armagh]]. The county board is also responsible for the Armagh inter-county teams.

===History===
Armagh has a long tradition of football. Several clubs were already in existence before the formation of the County Board in 1889.<ref>[http://www.newrymemoirs.com/stories_pages/relandpolsplitgaa_1.html Newry Memoirs] feature on GAA</ref> Armagh became only the second team to win the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] in 1890. In the early years of the GAA, a club that won its county championship went on to represent the county and would also wear the county colours. [[Armagh Harps GFC|Armagh Harps]] represented Armagh in the Ulster final, beating Tyrone (Cookstown's [[Cookstown Fr. Rock's GAC|Owen Roes]]), but losing to All-Ireland Champions Cork ([[Midleton GAA|Midleton]]) in the All-Ireland Semi-Final.

Despite early success at provincial level, national success at junior and minor level and All-Ireland final appearances in 1953 and 1977, it took until 2002 for Armagh to win their first and only [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] under manager [[Joe Kernan (Gaelic footballer)|Joe Kernan]]. The county won the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship, in 1949 and again in 2009. It lost the 1957 All-Ireland Minor final to Meath.

After a disappointing 2009 campaign which resulted in Armagh being defeated by Tyrone, Peter McDonnell stepped down as Armagh manager. He was replaced by [[Paddy O'Rourke (Down footballer)|Paddy O'Rourke]], who is from the neighbouring county of [[Down GAA|Down]]. In his first year as manager, Armagh won the Division 2 [[National Football League (Ireland)|NFL]] title and was promoted to Division 1 for 2011. They remained in Division 1 for 2012 but moved to Division 2 for 2013. Paul Grimley took over in 2013 and after a mixed year took the county to the quarter final of the All Ireland losing by a point to Donegal in 2014. It was the first quarter final appearance since 2008 and Grimley resigned afterwards allowing his assistant Kieran McGeeney to take over.

==Hurling==

===History===
Like most counties outside of the game's heartland of [[Munster]] and south [[Leinster]], hurling has ended to live in the shadow cast by Gaelic football in Armagh, with the exception of border areas such as Keady, Derrynoose and Middletown. However, in recent years the county hurlers have shown a marked improvement under the guidance of manager Mattie Lennon and his assistant Ger Rogan.

In 2006 Armagh won the NHL Division 3 championship, winning all their games in the group stages before beating Louth 3-10 to 1-11 in the final at Breffni Park in Cavan. The step up to Division 2 proved to be a difficult one for the men from the Orchard County. While the team failed to win any of their group games they were unfortunate to lose to Meath and also managed to come within a point of the 2006 [[Christy Ring Cup]] finalists Carlow. Heavier defeats were suffered at the hands of more established counties such as Derry and Laois.

Armagh returned to the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] in May 2007 for the first time in almost 60 years with a match against Derry. Despite putting in a strong performance the team lost out on the chance of a semi-final encounter with neighbours Down to an injury-time score.

The advances made in the county over the past two years placed them as favourites in the [[Nicky Rackard Cup]] encounter on August 12 against Roscommon; however they lost this game by two points.

In 2010, Armagh won the Nicky Rackard Cup, beating London on a scoreline of 3-15 to 3-14 on 3 July in Croke Park. The Minor team won the Ulster Minor Hurling League Division One title and reached the Ulster Minor Hurling Championship Final. The Under 21 team also reached the Ulster U21 Championship Final.

In 2011 the senior side reached the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] final for the first time since 1946 and made it to the [[Ulster Under-21 Hurling Championship]] final for the second year in a row for the first time in their history.

In 2012, Armagh won the Nicky Rackard Cup for the second time, beating Louth 3-20 to 1-15 on 9 June in Croke Park.

==Camogie==

===History===
The high point in Armagh's [[camogie]] history was an appearance in the [[National Camogie League]] final of [[National Camogie League 1995|1995]] against Cork, beating Galway and Wexford's first teams en route to the final. It came just one year after they qualified for senior status having won the [[All-Ireland Intermediate Camogie Championship]] in 1994, the [[All-Ireland Junior Camogie Championship|"Premier Junior"]] championship for the [[Kathleen Mills|Kay Mills Cup]] just twelve months earlier in 1993. The bulk of that team had emerged from an under-16 squad who reached the [[All-Ireland Minor Camogie Championship|All Ireland final]] of 1988.

Armagh won Division 2 of the National Camogie League four times, [[National Camogie League 1980|1980]], [[National Camogie League 1988|1988]], [[National Camogie League 1993|1993]] and [[National Camogie League 1994|1994]], and the [[All-Ireland Junior Camogie Championship#Nancy Murray Cup|Nancy Murray Cup]] in 2006.<ref>2006 Jun A Armagh 0-7 Laois 0-1 in Drogheda scorers in [http://www.independent.ie/sport/for-the-record-135362.html Irish Independent]</ref> Armagh qualified for the [[All-Ireland Minor Camogie Championship#All Ireland Minor B Finals|All Ireland Minor B final]] of 2003<ref>2003 minor b Waterford 6-11 Armagh 1-4 report in [http://www.independent.ie/sport/camogie-cork-minors-make-it-three-on-trot-207561.html Irish Independent]</ref> and won the Minor C championship in 2011.<ref>[http://www.camogie.ie/Home/tabid/54/mid/411/newsid412/1781/Murphy-goal-snatches-title-for-Armagh/Default.aspx Minor C final Armagh 3-5 Meath 1-10 report on camogie.ie]</ref>
