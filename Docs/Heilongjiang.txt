{{History of the Priamurye region}}
'''Heilongjiang''' ({{zh |s=黑龙江 |p={{Audio|zh-Heilongjiang.ogg|Hēilóngjiāng |help=no}}}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|province]] of the [[People's Republic of China]] located in the [[Northeast China|northeastern]] part of the country. "Heilongjiang" literally means [[Black]] [[Chinese dragon|Dragon]] [[River]], which is the Chinese name for the [[Amur river|Amur]]. The one-character abbreviation is 黑 ([[pinyin]]: Hēi). The [[Manchu language|Manchu]] name of the region is ''Sahaliyan ula'' (literally, "Black River"), from which the name of [[Sakhalin]] is derived, and the [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] name with the same meaning is ''Qaramörin''.

Heilongjiang borders [[Jilin]] in the south and [[Inner Mongolia]] to the west; it also borders [[Russia]] to the north and east.

The [[Amur River]] marks the border between the [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Russia]] to the north. Heilongjiang contains China's northernmost point (in [[Mohe County]] along the Amur) and easternmost point (at the junction of the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] Rivers).

==History==
In ancient times Heilongjiang was far from any literate civilization, and information was sparse. Ancient Chinese records and other sources state that Heilongjiang was inhabited by people such as the [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]], the [[Mohe people|Mohe]], and the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]. [[Mongol]]ic [[Donghu people]] lived in [[Inner Mongolia]] and the western part of Heilongjiang.<ref>[http://www.orientaldiscovery.com/html/2011/11/201111231554001713.html Origins of Minority Ethnic Groups in Heilongjiang]</ref>  Some names are Manchu or Mongolian.<ref>[http://www.iqh.net.cn/lsdl_dmx_show.asp?column_id=2506&column_cat_id=469 浅谈黑龙江省地名的特点]</ref> The eastern portion of Heilongjiang was ruled by the kingdom of [[Balhae]] between the 7th century and 10th century. The Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] that subsequently ruled much of north China arose within the borders of modern Heilongjiang.

[[File:CEM-44-La-Chine-la-Tartarie-Chinoise-et-le-Thibet-1734-Amur-2572.jpg|thumb|left|Heilongjiang and Jilin Provinces on a 1734 French map]]
Heilongjiang as an administrative entity was created in 1683, during the [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]] era of the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]], from the northwestern part of the [[Jilin]] province.<ref name=edmonds>{{cite book|title=Northern Frontiers of Qing China and Tokugawa Japan: A Comparative Study of Frontier Policy|first=Richard Louis|last=Edmonds|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Geography; Research Paper No. 213|isbn=0-89065-118-3|year=1985|page=6}}</ref> This Heilongjiang Province only included the western part of today's Heilongjiang Province, and was under the supervision of the General of Heilongjiang (the title is also translated as the Military Governor of Heilongjiang), whose power extended, according to the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], as far north as the [[Stanovoy Mountains]]. The eastern part of what's today Heilongjiang remained  under the supervision of the General of Jilin, whose power reached the [[Sea of Japan]]. These areas deep in [[Manchuria]] were closed off to [[Han Chinese]] migration.
 
The original seat of the Military Governor of Heilongjiang, as established in 1683, was in Heilongjang City (also known as [[Aigun]] or [[Heihe]], or, in [[Manchu language|Manchu]], Saghalien Ula), located on the Amur River. However, already in 1690 the seat of the governor was transferred to [[Nenjiang County|Nenjiang]] (Mergen) on the [[Nen River]], and, in 1699, further south to [[Qiqihar]]. According to modern historians, the moves may have been driven by supply considerations:  Nenjiang and Qiqihar are connected by a convenient waterway (Nen River) with southern Manchuria, whereas accessing Aigun (Heihe) would require either sailing all the way down the [[Sungari River]] until its confluence with the Amur and then up the Amur to Heihe, or using a [[portage]] over the Lesser Xing'an Mountains between the Nen River valley and the Amur valley. An additional advantage of Qiqihar may have been its location at the junction of a northbound road (to Nenjiang) and a westbound one (to Mongolia), enabling its garrison to defend both against the Russians and the Ölöt [[Mongols]].<ref>Edmonds (1985), pp. 115–117</ref>

Little Qing Military presence existed north of Aigun. According to the 18th and early 20th European sources, and the reports of the Russians in the 1850s, the farthest Qing "advance guard" post was at Ulusu-Modon (Ulussu-Mudan)  ({{lang-zh|乌鲁苏穆丹}}), near the Amur River's famous S-shaped meander. (The post was actually on the left bank of the river, lost to the Russians in 1860).

In 1858 and 1860 the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government was [[Amur Acquisition|forced to give up]] all land beyond the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] Rivers to the [[Russian Empire]], cutting off the Qing Empire from the [[Sea of Japan]] and giving Heilongjiang its present northern and eastern borders. At the same time, [[Manchuria]] was opened to [[Han Chinese]] migration by the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government. By the early twentieth century, due to the ''[[Chuang Guandong]]'', the [[Han Chinese]] had become the dominant ethnic group in the region.<ref>Patrick Fuliang Shan, "Taming China's Wilderness: Immigration, Settlement, and the Shaping of the Heilongjiang Frontier, 1900–1931," Ashgate, 2014, ISBN 978-1-4094-6389-4</ref>

In 1931, Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded]] Heilongjiang. In 1932, the Japanese completed their conquest of the province, which became part of the [[Japan]]ese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].

In 1945, Japanese forces in Manchuria were [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|defeated by the Soviet Army]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], Soviet forces aided the Chinese communists. Heilongjiang became the first province to be completely controlled by the communists and [[Harbin]] the first major city to be controlled by them.

At the beginning of communist rule, Heilongjiang included only the western portion of the present-day province, and had its capital at Qiqihar. The remaining area was the [[Songjiang Province|province of Songjiang]]; its capital was Harbin. In 1954, these two provinces were merged into present-day Heilongjiang. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Heilongjiang was also expanded to include [[Hulunbuir League]] and some other areas previously in [[Inner Mongolia]]; this has since mostly been reversed.

==Geography==
Heilongjiang is a land of varied topography. Much of the province is dominated by mountain ranges such as the [[Greater Khingan]] Range and [[Lesser Khingan]] Range, [[Zhangguangcai Mountains]], [[Laoye Mountains]], and [[Wanda Mountains]]. The highest peak is [[Mount Datudingzi]] at {{convert|1690|m}}, located on the border with [[Jilin]] province. The Greater Khingan Range contains China's largest remaining virgin forest and is an important area for China's forestry industry.

The east and southwest of the province, which are relatively flat and low in altitude, contain the [[Muling River]], the [[Naoli River]], the [[Songhua River]], the [[Nen River]], and the [[Mudan River]], all tributaries of the [[Amur River|Amur]], while the northern border forms part of the [[Amur River|Amur]] valley. [[Xingkai Lake]] (or [[Khanka Lake]]) is found on the border with [[Russia]]'s [[Primorsky Krai]].

A [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa'' or ''Dwb'') predominates in the province, though areas in the far north are [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] (Köppen ''Dwc'').<ref>[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Asia_Koppen_Map.png Updated Asian map of the Köppen climate classification system]</ref> Winters are long and bitter, with an average of {{convert|−31|to|−15|°C|°F|0}} in January, and summers are short and warm to very warm with an average of {{convert|18|to|23|°C|°F|0}} in July. The annual average rainfall is {{convert|400|to|700|mm|in|0}}, concentrated heavily in summer. Clear weather is prevalent throughout the year, and in the spring, the [[Songnen Plain]] and the [[Sanpingjiang Plain]] provide abundant sources of wind energy.

The province's largest cities include [[Harbin]], [[Daqing]], [[Qiqihar]], [[Mudanjiang]], [[Jiamusi]], [[Jixi]], [[Shuangyashan]], [[Hegang]], [[Qitaihe]], [[Yichun, Heilongjiang|Yichun]], and [[Heihe]].

==Transport==
A road and highway proposal was accepted in 2006; the project plans to develop 38,000 kilometers of new roads and expand Heilongjiang’s total road network to 2.3 million kilometers.

There are 60 rail lines of around 5,300 kilometers including a section of the Asia-Europe Continental Bridge. The [[Harbin–Dalian High-Speed Railway]], completed in 2012, stretches from Harbin, Heilongjiang’s capital, to [[Dalian]] in Liaoning province via [[Changchun]] and [[Shenyang]] comprising 23 stops. It is expected to transport 37 million passengers per year by 2020 and 51 million by 2030.

Major airports include [[Harbin Taiping International Airport]], [[Qiqihar Airport]], [[Mudanjiang Airport]], [[Jiamusi Airport]] and [[Heihe Airport]]. Harbin International Airport is capable of handling six million passengers every year and connects to over 70 domestic and international cities.

==Administrative divisions==

==Economy==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2008}}

The agriculture of Heilongjiang, heavily defined by its cold climate, is based upon crops such as [[soybean]]s, [[maize]], [[wheat]] and [[potato]]es.<ref name=li>{{cite encyclopedia |author=李景华 |title=马铃薯 |encyclopedia=[[中国大百科全书]]·农业卷 |year=1990 |publisher=中国大百科全书出版社 |url=http://dbk2.chinabaike.org/indexengine/entry_browse.cbs?db=book1&value=%C2%ED%C1%E5%CA%ED&jm=&flaghref=1}}</ref> Commercial crops grown include [[beet]]s, [[flax]], and [[sunflower]]s.

Heilongjiang is also an important source of lumber for China. Pine, especially the [[Korean pine]] and [[larch]] are the most important forms of lumber produced in Heilongjiang. Forests are mostly to be found in the [[Daxingan Mountains]] and [[Xiaoxingan Mountains]], which are also home to protected animal species such as the [[Siberian tiger]], the [[red-crowned crane]], and the [[lynx]].

Herding in Heilongjiang is centered upon horses and cattle; the province has the largest number of milk cows and the highest production of milk among all the province-level divisions of China.

[[Petroleum]] is of great importance in Heilongjiang, and the [[Daqing oilfields]] are an important source of petroleum for China. Coal, gold, and [[graphite]] are other important minerals to be found in Heilongjiang.

Heilongjiang is part of [[northeast China]], the country's traditional industrial base. Industry is focused upon coal, petroleum, lumber, machinery, and food. Due to its location, Heilongjiang is also an important gateway for trade with [[Russia]]. Since a wave of privatization led to the closure of uncompetitive factories in the 1990s, Manchuria has suffered from stagnation. As a result, the government has started the [[Northeast Area Revitalization Plan|Revitalize Northeast China]] campaign to deal with this problem, promoting the private sectors as the preferred method of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reform]].
