Morissette began her career in Canada when she signed a two-album recording contract with [[MCA Records|MCA Records Canada]] where she released two commercially successful  [[dance-pop]] albums, ''[[Alanis (album)|Alanis]]'' (1991) and ''[[Now Is the Time]]'' (1992). Following the release of the albums Morissette left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began working on new music, after moving from her hometown of [[Ottawa]] to [[Toronto]], but did not make much progress until travelling to Los Angeles, where she met [[Glen Ballard]].

Together the pair began creating what would become ''Jagged Little Pill'', and by the spring of 1995, she had signed a deal with Maverick Records. ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' was a departure from Morissette's previous work and featured rock genres. Released in 1995, ''Jagged Little Pill'' was a huge success and sold more than 33 million units globally.<ref name="Alanis Morissette: You ask the questions">{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/alanis-morissette-you-ask-the-questions-754619.html |title=Alanis Morissette: You ask the questions |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=April 21, 2005 | location=London | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/alanis-ties-for-highest-selling-debut-ever-19980805|title=Alanis Ties For Highest-Selling Debut Ever|date=August 5, 1998|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|accessdate=June 12, 2011|quote=Morissette's 1995 bow is now tied with Boston's self-titled 1976 album as the best-selling debut of all time}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044427/ask-billboard-missy-elliott-hot-100-and-the-best-selling-album-of-all-time|title=Ask Billboard: Missy Elliott, Hot 100 And The Best Selling Album Of All Time|first=Keith|last=Caulfield|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|accessdate=June 9, 2011|quote=We're including Morissette's "Jagged," as it was her U.S. major label debut}}</ref> Her following album, ''[[Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie]]'', was released in 1998.

== Music career ==

=== 1987: First demo ===
Morissette recorded her first demo called ''Fate Stay with Me'', produced by Lindsay Thomas Morgan at Marigold Studios in Toronto, engineered by [[Rich Dodson]] of Canadian classic rock band, [[The Stampeders]].<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/alanis-morissette-emc/ The Encyclopedia of Music in Canada. "Morissette, Alanis"]</ref>

=== 1991–92: Early career ===
In 1991 [[MCA Records|MCA Records Canada]] released Morissette's debut album, ''[[Alanis (album)|Alanis]]'', in Canada only. Morissette co-wrote every track on the album with its producer, [[Leslie Howe]]. The [[dance-pop]] album went [[platinum album|platinum]],<ref name=CRIA>[http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php "Search Certification Database"]. [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]].</ref> and its first single, "[[Too Hot (Alanis Morissette song)|Too Hot]]", reached the top twenty on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' singles chart. Subsequent singles "[[Walk Away (Alanis Morissette song)|Walk Away]]" and "[[Feel Your Love]]" reached the top 40. Morissette's popularity, style of music and appearance, particularly that of her hair, led her to become known as the [[Debbie Gibson]] of Canada;<ref name=PeopleintheNews>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0301/04/pitn.00.html "Transcript: Profiles of Alanis Morissette, Margaret Cho"].

During the same period, she was a concert opening act for rapper [[Vanilla Ice]].<ref name=Time-Feb1996>Farley, Christopher John.

February 26, 1996.</ref> Morissette was nominated for three 1992 [[Juno Award]]s: [[Juno Award for Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year|Most Promising Female Vocalist of the Year]] (which she won), [[Juno Award for Single of the Year|Single of the Year]] and [[Juno Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]] (both for "Too Hot").<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1992/1992junos.htm "1992 22nd Juno Awards"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref>

In 1992, she released her second album, ''[[Now Is the Time]]'', a [[ballad (music)|ballad]]-driven record that featured less glitzy production than ''Alanis'' and contained more thoughtful lyrics.<ref name=PeopleintheNews/> Morissette wrote the songs with the album's producer, Leslie Howe, and Serge Côté. She said of the album, "people could go, 'Boo, hiss, hiss, this girl's like another Tiffany or whatever.' But the way I look at it ... people will like your next album if it's a suck-ass one."<ref name=Time-Feb1996/> As with ''Alanis'' (1991), ''Now Is the Time'' (1992) was released only in Canada and produced three top 40 singles—"[[An Emotion Away]]", the minor [[adult contemporary]] hit "[[No Apologies (Alanis Morissette song)|No Apologies]]" and "(Change Is) Never a Waste of Time". It was a commercial failure, however, selling only a little more than half the copies of her first album.<ref name=PeopleintheNews/><ref name=RS-Nov1995>Wild, David.

=== 1993–97: Move to Los Angeles and ''Jagged Little Pill'' ===
In 1993, Morissette's publisher Leeds Levy at MCA Music Publishing introduced her to manager Scott Welch.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_SWelch.html |title=Interview With Scott Welch |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=August 6, 2002 |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}</ref> Welch told [[HitQuarters]] he was impressed by her "spectacular voice", her character and her lyrics.

Maverick Records released ''[[Jagged Little Pill]]'' internationally in 1995. The album was expected only to sell enough for Morissette to make a follow-up, but the situation changed quickly when [[KROQ-FM]], an influential Los Angeles [[modern rock]] radio station, began playing "[[You Oughta Know]]", the album's first single.<ref name="SongwriterUniverseMagazine">{{cite news | last=Kawashima | first=Dale | url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/alanis.html | title=Great Publishing Story: John Alexander & Alanis Morissette | work=Songwriter Universe Magazine | accessdate=June 11, 2010 }}</ref> The song instantly garnered attention for its scathing, explicit lyrics,<ref name=PeopleintheNews/> and a subsequent music video went into heavy rotation on MTV and [[MuchMusic]].

After the success of "[[You Oughta Know]]", the album's other hit singles helped send ''Jagged Little Pill'' to the top of the charts. "[[All I Really Want (Alanis Morissette song)|All I Really Want]]" and "[[Hand in My Pocket]]" followed, but the fourth U.S. single, "[[Ironic (song)|Ironic]]", became Morissette's biggest hit. "[[You Learn]]" and "[[Head over Feet]]", the fifth and sixth singles, respectively, kept ''Jagged Little Pill'' (1995) in the top twenty on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart for more than a year.

Morissette was featured as a guest vocalist on [[Ringo Starr]]'s cover of "[[Drift Away]]" on his 1998 album, ''[[Vertical Man]]'', and on the songs "[[Don't Drink the Water (Dave Matthews Band song)|Don't Drink the Water]]" and "[[Spoon (Dave Matthews Band song)|Spoon]]" on the [[Dave Matthews Band]] album ''[[Before These Crowded Streets]]''. She recorded the song "[[Uninvited (song)|Uninvited]]" for the soundtrack to the 1998 film ''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]''. Although the track was never commercially released as a single, it received widespread radio airplay in the U.S. At the [[1999 Grammy Awards]], it won in the categories of Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and was nominated for [[Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]].<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1998/1998grammy.htm "1998 41st Grammy Awards"]. ''Los Angeles Times''.</ref> Later in 1998, Morissette released her fourth album, ''[[Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie]]'', which she wrote and produced with Glen Ballard.

Privately, the label hoped to sell a million copies of the album on initial release;<ref name=EW-Nov1998/> instead, it debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart with first-week sales of 469,000 copies—a record, at the time, for the highest first-week sales of an album by a female artist.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000525/ai_n13864275 "'Oops!'

Morissette contributed vocals to "Mercy", "Hope", "Innocence", and "Faith", four tracks on [[Jonathan Elias]]'s project ''[[The Prayer Cycle]]'', which was released in 1999. The same year, she released the live acoustic album ''[[Alanis Unplugged]]'', which was recorded during her appearance on the television show ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. It featured tracks from her previous two albums alongside four new songs, including "[[King of Pain]]" (a cover of [[The Police]] song) and "No Pressure over Cappuccino", which Morissette wrote with her main guitar player, Nick Lashley. The recording of the ''Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie'' track "[[That I Would Be Good]]", released as a single, became a minor hit on [[hot adult contemporary]] radio in America. Also in 1999, Morissette released a live version of her song "Are You Still Mad" on the charity album ''[[Live in the X Lounge#Live in the X Lounge II (1999)|Live in the X Lounge II]]''. For her live rendition of "So Pure" at [[Woodstock '99]], she was nominated for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the [[2001 Grammy Awards]].<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/2000/2000grammy.htm "2000 43rd Grammy Awards"].

=== 2001–03: ''Under Rug Swept'' and ''Feast on Scraps'' ===
In 2001, Morissette was featured with [[Stephanie McKay]] on the [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] song "Excess", which is on his album ''[[Blowback (album)|Blowback]]''. Morissette released her fifth studio album, ''[[Under Rug Swept]]'', in February 2002. For the first time in her career, she took on the role of sole writer and producer of an album. Her band, comprising [[Pedestrian (band)|Joel Shearer]], Nick Lashley, Chris Chaney, and Gary Novak, played the majority of the instruments; additional contributions came from [[Eric Avery]], [[Dean DeLeo]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], and [[Meshell Ndegeocello]].

''Under Rug Swept'' debuted at number one on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart, eventually going platinum in Canada and selling one million copies in the U.S.<ref name=CRIA/><ref name="AskBillboard">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/951082/ask-billboard-taylor-swift-the-script-alanis-morissette|title= Ask Billboard: Taylor Swift, The Script, Alanis Morissette|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=November 26, 2010|date=November 12, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101126025658/http://www.billboard.com/| archivedate= November 26, 2010 <!-- DASHBot -->| deadurl= no}}</ref> It produced the hit single "[[Hands Clean]]", which topped the [[Canadian Singles Chart]] and received substantial radio play; for her work on "Hands Clean" and "[[So Unsexy]]", Morissette won a [[Juno Award for Producer of the Year]].<ref>[http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/2002/2002junob.htm "2002 33rd Juno Awards"].

Morissette hosted the [[Juno Awards of 2004]] dressed in a bathrobe, which she took off to reveal a flesh-colored bodysuit, a response to the era of [[censorship]] in the U.S. caused by [[Janet Jackson]]'s breast-reveal incident during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show]].<ref name=CP-Apr2004/> Morissette released her sixth studio album, ''[[So-Called Chaos]]'', in May 2004. She wrote the songs on her own again, and co-produced the album with [[Tim Thorney]] and pop music producer [[John Shanks]]. The album debuted at number five on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart to generally mixed critical reviews, and it became Morissette's lowest seller in the U.S.<ref name="AskBillboard"/> The lead single, "[[Everything (Alanis Morissette song)|Everything]]", achieved major success on [[adult top 40]] radio in America and was moderately popular elsewhere, particularly in Canada, although it failed to reach the top 40 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. Because the first line of the song includes the word ''asshole'', American radio stations refused to play it, and the single version was changed to include the word ''nightmare'' instead.<ref name=CP-Apr2004>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/mini/CTVNews/1081193845483_76603045?s_name=junos2004&no_ads=y.

Morissette embarked on a U.S. summer tour with long-time friends and fellow Canadians [[Barenaked Ladies]], working with the non-profit environmental organization [[Reverb (non-profit)|Reverb]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reverbrock.org/site/ |title=R E V E R B &#124; |publisher=Reverbrock.org |date= |accessdate=February 18, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100126213006/http://www.reverbrock.org/site/| archivedate= January 26, 2010 <!-- DASHBot -->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

To commemorate the tenth anniversary of ''Jagged Little Pill'' (1995), Morissette released a studio [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic]] version, ''[[Jagged Little Pill Acoustic]]'', in June 2005. The album was released exclusively through [[Starbucks]]' [[Hear Music]] retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run. The limited availability led to a dispute between Maverick Records and [[HMV]] North America, who retaliated by removing Morissette's other albums from sale for the duration of Starbucks's exclusive six-week sale.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4095358.stm "Morissette in Starbucks album row"].

Morissette opened for [[The Rolling Stones]] for a few dates of their [[A Bigger Bang Tour]] in the autumn of 2005.

Morissette released the [[greatest hits album]] ''[[Alanis Morissette: The Collection]]'' in late 2005. The lead single and only new track, a cover of [[Seal (musician)|Seal]]'s "[[Crazy (Seal song)|Crazy]]", was a U.S. adult top 40 and dance hit, but it achieved only minimal chart success elsewhere. A limited edition of ''The Collection'' features a DVD including a documentary with videos of two unreleased songs from Morissette's 1996 Can't Not Tour: "King of Intimidation" and "Can't Not". (A reworked version of "Can't Not" had also appeared on ''Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie''.) The DVD also includes a ninety-second clip of the unreleased video for the single "[[Joining You]]". As of November 2010, ''The Collection'' had sold 373,000 copies in the U.S., according to Soundscan.<ref name="AskBillboard"/>

Morissette contributed the song "[[Wunderkind (song)|Wunderkind]]" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', and it was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].<ref name=RS-Jan2006>Baltin, Steve.

[[File:Alanis Morissette at Espacio Movistar 6.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Alanis during a live concert in Barcelona, June 2008]]

2006 marked the first year in Morissette's musical career without a single concert appearance showcasing her own songs, with the exception of an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' in January when she performed "Wunderkind".

On April 1, 2007, Morissette released a tongue-in-cheek cover of [[The Black Eyed Peas]]'s selection "[[My Humps]]", which she recorded in a slow, mournful voice, accompanied only by a piano. The accompanying YouTube-hosted video, in which she dances provocatively with a group of men and hits the ones who attempt to touch her "lady lumps", had received 16,465,653 views on February 15, 2009.<ref name="Undercover.com.au">The Celebrity Truth.

Morissette performed at a gig for [[The Nightwatchman]], a.k.a. [[Tom Morello]] of [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Audioslave]] fame, at the Hotel Café in Los Angeles in April 2007.

Morissette's seventh studio album, ''[[Flavors of Entanglement]]'', which was produced by [[Guy Sigsworth]], was released in mid-2008. She has stated that in late 2008, she would embark on a North American headlining tour, but in the meantime she would be promoting the album internationally by performing at shows and festivals and making television and radio appearances. The album's first single was "[[Underneath (Alanis Morissette song)|Underneath]]", a video for which was submitted to the 2007 Elevate Film Festival, the purpose of which festival was to create documentaries, music videos, narratives and shorts regarding subjects to raise the level of human consciousness on the earth.<ref name=ElevateFilmFestival-Sept15>[http://www.elevatefilmfestival.com "Official Elevate Film Festival Website"].

== Acting career ==
In 1986, Morissette had her first stint as an actress: five episodes of the children's television show ''[[You Can't Do That on Television]]''. She appeared on stage with the [[Orpheus Musical Theatre Society]] in 1985 and 1988.<ref>[http://www.orpheus-theatre.on.ca/members-only/alumni.html "Where Are They Now?"].

In 1999, Morissette delved into acting again, for the first time since 1993, appearing as God in the [[Kevin Smith]] comedy ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'' and contributing the song "Still" to its soundtrack. Morissette reprised her role as God for a [[post-credits scene]] in Smith's next film, ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', to literally close the book on the [[View Askewniverse]]. She also appeared in the hit [[Home Box Office|HBO]] comedies ''[[Sex and the City]]'' and ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', appeared in the play ''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', and had brief cameos playing herself in the [[Brazil]]ian hit soap operas "[[Celebridade (telenovela)|Celebridade]]" and [[Malhação]].

In late 2003, Morissette appeared in the [[Off-Broadway]] play ''[[The Exonerated (play)|The Exonerated]]'' as Sunny Jacobs, a [[death row]] inmate freed after proof surfaced that she was innocent.

She expanded her acting credentials with the July 2004 release of the [[Cole Porter]] [[biographical film]] ''[[De-Lovely]]'', in which she performed the song "[[Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)]]" and had a brief role as an anonymous stage performer. In February 2005, she made a guest appearance on the Canadian television show ''[[Degrassi: The Next Generation]]'' with ''Dogma'' co-star [[Jason Mewes]] and director Kevin Smith.  Also in 2005, Morissette, then Ryan Reynolds's fiancée, made a [[cameo appearance]] as "herself" as a former client of Reynolds' character in the film ''[[Just Friends]]''.
