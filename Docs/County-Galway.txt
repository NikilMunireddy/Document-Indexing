'''County Galway''' ({{lang-gle|Contae na Gaillimhe}}) is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  In the [[West Region, Ireland|West of Ireland]], it is part of the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Connacht]] and is named after the city of [[Galway]]. There are several [[Gaeltacht|Irish-speaking areas]] in the west of the county. The population of the county is 250,541 according to the 2011 census.<ref>[http://beyond2020.cso.ie/Census/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=75467 Census 2006 - Population of each province, county and city]</ref> While it is named after the city of Galway, a different [[Galway City Council|authority]] governs that territory. The county proper is [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|administered]] by [[Galway County Council]].

==History==
[[File:Galway 1, Ireland.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dunguaire Castle]], built c. 1520]]
The first inhabitants in the Galway area arrived over [[5th millennium BC|7000 years ago]]. Shell [[midden]]s indicate the existence of people as early as 5000 BC.

The county originally comprised several kingdoms and territories which predate the formation of the county. These kingdoms included [[Aidhne]], [[Uí Maine]], [[Maigh Seóla]], [[Conmhaícne Mara]], [[Soghain]] and [[Máenmaige]]. County Galway became an official entity around 1569 AD. In modern times, a number of inhabited islands are also administered by the county; these include Oileáin Árann ([[Aran Islands]]) and Inis Bó Fine ([[Inishbofin, County Galway|Inishbofin]]).

With the arrival of [[Christianity]] many [[monastery|monasteries]] were built in the county. Monasteries kept written records of events in the area and of its people. These were followed by a number of law-tracts, genealogies, annals and miscellaneous accounts. Extant manuscripts containing references to Galway include:

==Irish language==
Nearly 20% of the population of County Galway live in the Gaeltacht (Gaelic-speaking districts). County Galway is home to the largest [[Gaeltacht]] Irish-speaking region in Ireland. There are over 48,907 people living within this region which extends from Galway city westwards through [[Connemara]]. The region consists of the following Irish speaking areas; [[Galway City Gaeltacht]], [[Gaeltacht Cois Fharraige]], [[Conamara Theas]], [[Aran Islands]] and [[Joyce Country|Duiche Sheoigheach]].

All schools within the Gaeltacht use the Irish language for classroom instruction. There is also a third-level constituent college of [[NUIG]] called [[Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge]] in [[Carraroe]] and [[Carna, County Galway|Carna]]. [[Spiddal]] is the largest town in the region. Galway city is also home to Ireland's only Irish-language theatre [[Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe]]. There is a strong Irish-language media presence in this area too, which boasts the radio station [[Raidió na Gaeltachta]] and [[Foinse]] newspaper in [[Carraroe]] and national TV station [[TG4]] in [[Baile na hAbhann]]. The [[Aran Islands]] are also part of the Galway Gaeltacht.

There are about 30,000 - 40,000 Irish speakers in County Galway. According to Census 2011, the Galway city and county Gaeltacht has a population of 48,907, of which 30,978 say they can speak Irish, 23,788 can be classed as native Irish speakers while 7,190 speak Irish daily only within the classroom.  There are 3,006 attending the ten [[Gaelscoil]] (Irish language primary schools) and three [[Gaelcholáiste]] (Irish language secondary schools) outside of the Galway Gaeltacht.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/assets/Staitistic%C3%AD-2010-2011_Gaeilge.pdf|title=Oideachas Trí Mheán na Gaeilge in Éirinn sa Ghalltacht 2010-2011|year=2011|publisher=gaelscoileanna.ie|language=Irish|accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> According to the Irish Census 2006 there are 10,788 in the county who identify themselves as being daily Irish speakers outside of the education system.

==Local government and politics==
Prior to the enactment of the [[Local Government Act 2001]], the county was a unified whole despite the presence of two [[Local authority|local authorities]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} Since that time, the administrative re-organisation has reduced the geographical extent of the county by the extent of the area under the jurisdiction of [[Galway City Council]]. Today, the geographic extent of the county is limited to the area under the jurisdiction of [[Galway County Council]]. Each [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] ranks equally as first level [[local administrative unit]]s of the [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] [[West Region, Ireland|West Region]] for [[Eurostat]] purposes. There are 34 [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland#Local administrative units|LAU 1]] entities in the Republic of Ireland. The remit of Galway County Council includes some suburbs of the city not within the remit of Galway City Council. Both local authorities are responsible for certain local [[Public services|services]] such as [[sanitation]], [[planning]] and [[Real estate development|development]], [[library|libraries]], the collection of [[automobile|motor]] [[tax]]ation, local [[road]]s and [[social housing]].

The county is part of the [[North-West (European Parliament constituency)|North–West]] constituency for the purposes of [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]]. For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the county is part of three constituencies: [[Galway East (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Galway East]], [[Galway West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Galway West]] and [[Roscommon–Galway (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Roscommon–Galway]]. Together they return 11 deputies ([[Teachta Dála|TDs]]) to the Dáil.

==Geography==
[[File:dunaonghasa2.jpg|thumb|267px|A view over the [[karst topography|karst]] landscape on [[Inishmore]], from Dún Aengus, an ancient stone fort.]]
County Galway is home to Na Beanna Beola ([[Twelve Bens]]) mountain range, Na Sléibhte Mhám Toirc (the Maum Turk mountains), and the low mountains of Sliabh Echtghe (Slieve Aughty). The highest point in the county is one of the Twelve Bens, Benbaun, at 729m.

===Lakes===
County Galway is partly home to a number of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland's]] largest lakes including [[Lough Corrib]] (the largest lake in the Republic of Ireland), [[Lough Derg (Shannon)|Lough Derg]] and [[Lough Mask]]. The county is also home to a large number of smaller lakes, many of which are in the [[Connemara]] region. These include [[Lough Anaserd]], [[Ardderry Lough]], [[Aughrusbeg Lough]], [[Ballycuirke Lough]], [[Ballynahinch Lake]], [[Lough Bofin (Galway)|Lough Bofin]], [[Lough Cutra]], [[Derryclare Lough]], [[Lough Fee]], [[Glendollagh Lough]], [[Lough Glenicmurrin]], [[Lough Inagh]], [[Kylemore Lough]], [[Lettercraffroe Lough]], [[Maumeen Lough]], [[Lough Nafooey]], [[Lough Rea]], [[Ross Lake (Ireland)|Ross Lake]] and [[Lough Shindilla]].

===Climate===
The location of County Galway, situated on the west coast of Ireland, allows it to be directly influenced by the [[Gulf Stream]]. Temperature extremes are rare and short lived, though inland areas, particularly east of the Corrib, can boast some of the highest recorded temperatures of the summer in the island of Ireland (sometimes exceeding 30&nbsp;°C); though these temperatures only occur when land warmed east winds sweep the area; the opposite effect can occur in the winter. Overall, however, Galway is influenced mainly by Atlantic airstreams which bring ample rainfall in between the fleeting sunshine. Rainfall occurs in every month of the year, though the late autumn and winter months can be particularly wet as Atlantic cyclonic activity increases and passes over and around the area, and which is why Galway tends to bear the brunt of severe windstorms that can occur between August and March. The county on average receives about 1300mm of rainfall annually, though some areas along the west coast of the county can receive up to 1900mm and beyond. [[Extreme weather]] such as blizzards, thunderstorms, flash flooding and hail, though rare, can and do occur, particularly when [[air mass]]es of continental origin are undercut by more humid and unstable Atlantic flows.

===Flora and fauna===
One of the least densely populated counties, County Galway harbors a variety of wildlife. The region's biodiversity is best represented by [[Connemara National Park]], situated in the west of the county.

===Largest settlements in County Galway (2011 Census)===
# [[Galway]], 76,778
# [[Tuam]], 8,242
# [[Ballinasloe]], 6,659
# [[Loughrea]], 5,062
# [[Oranmore]], 4,799

==Sports==
{{See also|Sport in Galway}}
Gaelic games are the most popular sport in the county. Galway had traditional regions in which Gaelic football or hurling is played. For example, in south and eastern County Galway, in places such as [[Portumna]], [[Gort]], [[Clarinbridge]] and [[Athenry]], hurling is the dominant sport with successful teams at county and national level. Most of the rest of the county is considered to be footballing territory, with most of the county players being from [[Tuam]], [[Oughterard]] or parts of [[Galway|Galway city]].

[[Galway United FC]] compete in the [[League of Ireland|SSE Aitricity League of Ireland]] and plays home games in [[Eamonn Deacy Park]].
