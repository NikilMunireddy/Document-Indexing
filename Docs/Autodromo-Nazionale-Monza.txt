The '''Autodromo Nazionale Monza''' is a [[race track]] located near the city of [[Monza]], north of [[Milan]], in [[Italy]]. The circuit's biggest event is the [[Formula One]] [[Italian Grand Prix]]. With the exception of [[1980 Italian Grand Prix|1980]], the race has been hosted there since the series's inception.<ref name=F1.comHistory>{{cite web|title=The hidden history of the Monza banking|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2005/8/3500.html|work=Formula One Administration Ltd|publisher=Formula1.com|date=30 August 2005|accessdate=17 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091002073754/http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2005/8/3500.html| archivedate= 2 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

The high speed curve, Curva Grande, is located after the ''Variante del Rettifilo'' which is located at the end of the front straight or ''Rettifilo Tribune'', and is usually taken flat out by Formula One cars.

Drivers are on full throttle for most of the lap due to its long straights and fast corners, and is usually the scenario in which the open-wheeled Formula One cars show the raw [[speed]] they are capable of--{{convert|372|km/h|0}} during the mid-2000s [[V10 engine]] formula, although in [[2012 Italian Grand Prix|2012]] with the 2.4L [[V8 engine]]s, top speeds in Formula One rarely reached over {{convert|340|km/h|0}}; the 1.6L turbocharged [[hybrid electric vehicle|hybrid]] [[V6 engine]], 8-speed [[transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] formula of 2014 displayed top speeds of up to {{convert|360|km/h|0}}.

Since both maximum [[power (physics)|power]] and minimal drag are keys for speed on the straights, only competitors with enough power or aerodynamic efficiency at their disposal are able to challenge for the top places.<ref name=Clarin/>

In addition to Formula One, the circuit hosts an endurance event, the [[1000 km Monza]], which has been run as part of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] and the [[Le Mans Series]]. Monza also featured the unique [[Race of Two Worlds]] events, which attempted to run Formula One and [[United States Auto Club]] [[American Championship Car Racing|National Championship]] cars against each other, and previously held rounds of [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]], in the [[Italian motorcycle Grand Prix]]. Current major events are races of the [[World Touring Car Championship]] and the [[Superbike World Championship]], as well as various local championship races.

The Monza circuit has been [[List of Autodromo Nazionale Monza fatal accidents|the site of many fatal accidents]], especially in the early years of the Formula One world championship,<ref name=Clarin/> and has claimed the lives of 52 drivers and 35 spectators. Track modifications have continuously occurred, to improve spectator safety and reduce curve speeds,<ref name=F1.comHistory/> but it is still criticised by the current drivers for its lack of run-off areas, most notoriously at the chicane that cuts the ''Variante della Roggia''.<ref name=Clarin/>

The first track was built from May to July 1922 by 3,500 workers, financed by the Milan Automobile Club<ref name=MonzaNet1922/> – which created the ''Società Incremento Automobilismo e Sport'' (SIAS) (English: ''Motoring and Sport Encouragement Company'') to run the track.<ref name=F1db/> The initial form was a {{convert|3.4|km2|2}} site with {{convert|10|km|1}} of [[macadam]]ised road – comprising a {{convert|4.5|km|2}} loop track, and a {{convert|5.5|km|2}} road track.<ref name=MonzaNet1922/><ref name=F1db/> The track was officially opened on 3 September 1922, with the maiden race the second Italian Grand Prix held on 10 September 1922.<ref name=F1db>{{cite web|title=Autodromo Nazionale di Monza – History|url=http://www.f1db.com/f1/page/Autodromo_Nazionale_di_Monza|work=The Formula One DataBase|publisher=F1db.com|date=6 April 2005|accessdate=17 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091002042349/http://www.f1db.com/f1/page/Autodromo_Nazionale_di_Monza| archivedate= 2 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1928, the most serious Italian racing accident to date<ref name=MonzaNet1922/><ref name=Clarin/> ended in the death of driver [[Emilio Materassi]] and 27 spectators at that year's Grand Prix.<ref name=MonzaNet1922/><ref name=Clarin/> The accident led to further Grand Prix races confinement to the high-speed loop until 1932.<ref name=MonzaNet1929>{{cite web|title=1929–1939: In consequence of the Materassi's accident, races are run on the alternative tracks|url=http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1929_39.aspx|work=Autodromo Nazionale Monza|publisher=MonzaNet.it|year=2007|accessdate=17 September 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080415212757/http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1929_39.aspx|archivedate=15 April 2008}}</ref> The 1933 race was marked by the deaths of three drivers<ref name=F1db/> and the Grand Prix layout was changed, with two chicanes added and the longer straights removed.<ref name=Monza33>{{cite web|url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/monza33.html|title=8W – When? – 1933 Monza GP, ''"Black Sunday"''|publisher=Forix.autosport.com|date=May 2001|accessdate=17 September 2009}}</ref>

===High speed oval===
In 1954, work began to entirely revamp the circuit, resulting in a {{convert|5.750|km|3}} course, and a new {{convert|4.250|km|3}} high-speed oval with banked ''sopraelevata'' curves.<ref name=F1.comHistory/><ref name=MonzaNet1955>{{cite web|title=1955–1971: Construction of the high speed track and other important works|url=http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1955_71.aspx|work=Autodromo Nazionale Monza|publisher=MonzaNet.it|year=2007|accessdate=17 September 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080415212806/http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1955_71.aspx| archivedate = 15 April 2008}}</ref> The two circuits could be combined to re-create the former {{convert|10|km|3}}<ref name=F1.comHistory/> long circuit, with cars running parallel on the main straight.

===Circuit changes and modernisation===

Both car and [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing]] were regular attractions at Monza,<ref name=MonzaNet1955/> but as the speed of the machines were increasing, two [[chicane]]s- the Variante del Rettifilo at the middle of the start/finish straight,<ref name=MonzaNet1972>{{cite web|title=1972–1978: Chicane and variants to reduce the high speed|url=http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1972_78.aspx|work=Autodromo Nazionale Monza|publisher=MonzaNet.it|year=2007|accessdate=17 September 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080611175253/http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1972_78.aspx |archivedate = 11 June 2008}}</ref>  and the Variante ''Ascari'', were added in 1972 to reduce racing speeds.<ref name=F1db/> This resulted in a new circuit length of {{convert|5.755|km|3}}.<ref name=MonzaNet1972/> Grand Prix motorcycles continued to use the un-slowed road track until two serious accidents resulted in five deaths, including [[Renzo Pasolini]] and [[Jarno Saarinen]],<ref name=MonzaNet1972/> in 1973, and motorcycle racing did not return to Monza until 1981.<ref name=MonzaNet1972/> These races involved drivers constantly slipstreaming competing cars, which produced several close finishes, such as in [[1967 Italian Grand Prix|1967]], [[1969 Italian Grand Prix|1969]], and [[1971 Italian Grand Prix|1971]]; the last year the Italian Grand Prix was run at Monza without chicanes.

The 1972 chicanes were soon seen to be ineffective at slowing cars; the ''Vialone'' was remade in 1974,<ref name=MonzaNet1972/> the other, ''Curva Grande'' in 1976,<ref name=F1db/> and a third also added in 1976 before the ''Lesmo'', with extended run-off areas.<ref name=MonzaNet1972/> The Grand Prix lap after these alterations was increased to {{convert|5.800|km|3}} long.<ref name=MonzaNet1972/>

With technology still increasing vehicle speeds the track was modified again in 1979, with added kerbs, extended run-off areas, and tyre-barriers improved, to improve safety for drivers off the track.<ref name=MonzaNet1979>{{cite web|title=1979–1988: New works to update the circuit|url=http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1979_88.aspx|work=Autodromo Nazionale Monza|publisher=MonzaNet.it|year=2007|accessdate=17 September 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080415212811/http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1979_88.aspx| archivedate = 15 April 2008}}</ref> The infrastructure was also improved, with pits able to accommodate 46 cars, and an upgraded paddock and scrutineering facilities.<ref name=MonzaNet1979/>  These changes encouraged world championship motorcycling to return in 1981, but further safety work was undertaken through the 1980s.<ref name=MonzaNet1979/>  Also in the 1980s the podium, paddock and pits complex, stands,<ref name=MonzaNet1979/><ref name=MonzaNet1989>{{cite web|title=1989–1997: New pit complex and the interventions for the security|url=http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1989_97.aspx|work=Autodromo Nazionale Monza|publisher=MonzaNet.it|year=2007|accessdate=17 September 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080413073732/http://www.monzanet.it/eng/storia_1989_97.aspx| archivedate = 13 April 2008}}</ref> and camp site were either rebuilt or improved.<ref name=F1db/>

In the safety conscious years following [[Death of Ayrton Senna|the death]] of [[Ayrton Senna]] in 1994 (albeit at a [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|different track]]), the three main long curves were "squeezed" in order to install larger gravel traps, shortening the lap to {{convert|5.770|km|3}}.<ref name=MonzaNet1989/>  In 1997 the stands were reworked to expand capacity to 51,000.<ref name=MonzaNet1989/> In 2000, the [[chicane]] on the main straight was altered, changing from a double left-right chicane to a single right-left chicane in an attempt to reduce the frequent accidents at the starts due to the conformation of the braking area, although it is still deemed unsafe in terms of motorcycle racing.  The second chicane was also re-profiled.  In the Formula 1 Grand Prix of the same year, the first to use these new chicanes, a marshal, Paolo Gislimberti, was killed by flying debris after a big pileup in the third chicane.<ref name=Clarin/>

In 2007, the run off area at the second chicane was changed from gravel to asphalt. The length of the track in its current configuration is {{convert|5.793|km|3}}.<ref name=F1.comLap/> At the [[2010 Monza Superbike World Championship round]], Italian rider [[Max Biaggi]] set the fastest ever motorcycle lap of Monza when he rode his [[Aprilia RSV 4|Aprilia RSV4 1000 F]] to pole position in a time of 1:42.121. In the Superpole qualification for the 2011 race, he improved on this lap time, for a new lap record of 1:41.745 and his speed was captured at 205+ MPH.

==A lap of the circuit in a Formula One car==
[[Image:Autodromo Monza.jpg|thumb|The 1120 metre start/finish straight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mclaren.com/formula1/2015/italian-grand-prix/2015-italian-grand-prix-preview/|title=McLaren Formula 1 - 2015 Italian Grand Prix Preview|publisher=McLaren|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>]]
Monza consists of very long straights and tight chicanes, putting a premium on good braking stability and traction.  The {{convert|5.793|km|3}}<ref name=F1.comLap/> circuit is very hard on gearboxes, with many gear changes per lap. Formula 1 engines are at full throttle for nearly 80% of the lap, with engine failures common, notably [[Fernando Alonso]] in the [[2006 Italian Grand Prix]].

Formula One cars are set up with one of the smallest wing angles on the F1 calendar to ensure the lowest level of drag on the straights. There are only 4 proper corners at Monza, the two ''Lesmos'', the ''Ascari'' complex and the ''Parabolica'', thus cars are set up for maximum performance on the straights.

Cars approach the first corner at {{convert|340|km/h}} in seventh gear,<ref name=F1.comLap/> and brake at about {{convert|120|m}} before the first chicane – the ''Variante del Rettifilo'' – entering at {{convert|86|km/h}} in first gear, and exiting at {{convert|74|km/h}} in second gear.<ref name=F1.comLap/> This is the scene of many first lap accidents. Higher kerbs were installed at the first two chicanes in 2009 to prevent cutting.<ref name="The Official Formula 1 Website">{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/9/9881.html|title=Bigger kerbs installed for Monza chicanes|publisher=formula 1.com|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=21 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091004215814/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/9/9881.html| archivedate= 4 October 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

Good traction out of the first corner is imperative for a quick lap. Conservation of speed through the first chicane is made possible by driving the straightest line, as a small mistake here can result in a lot of time being lost through the ''Curva Grande'' down to the ''Variante della Roggia'' chicane in seventh gear, at {{convert|330|km/h}}.<ref name=F1.comLap/> The braking point is just under the bridge. The kerbs are very vicious and it is very easy for a car to become unbalanced and a driver to lose control, as [[Kimi Räikkönen]] did in 2005. This chicane is probably the best overtaking chance on the lap, as it is the only one with the "slow corner, long straight, slow corner"; one of the characteristics of modern circuits.

The ''Curve di Lesmo'' are two corners that are not as fast as they used to be, but are still challenging corners. The first is blind, entered at {{convert|264|km/h}} in fifth gear, dropping to fourth gear at {{convert|193|km/h}},<ref name=F1.comLap/> and has a slight banking. The second is a fifth gear entry at {{convert|260|km/h}}, apexing in third gear at {{convert|178|km/h}},<ref name=F1.comLap/> and it is very important that all the kerb is used. A mistake at one of these corners will result either in a spin into the gravel or an overtaking move into ''Variante Ascari''.

The downhill straight down to ''Variante Ascari'' is very bumpy under the bridge. ''Variante Ascari'' is a very tricky sequence of corners and is key to the lap time.

The final challenge is the ''Curva Parabolica'': approaching at {{convert|335|km/h}} in seventh gear,<ref name=F1.comLap/> cars quickly dance around the corner, apexing in fourth gear at {{convert|215|km/h}}<ref name=F1.comLap/> and exiting in fifth gear at {{convert|285|km/h}},<ref name=F1.comLap/> accelerating onto the main start/finish straight. A good exit and slipstream off a fellow driver along the main straight can produce an overtaking opportunity under heavy braking into ''Variante del Rettifilio;'' however, it is difficult to follow a leading car closely through the ''Parabolica'' as the tow will reduce downforce and cornering speed.

Maximum speed achieved in a 2009 Formula One car is {{convert|340|km/h}}, achieved at the end of the start/finish straight.<ref name=F1.comLap/> They experience a maximum [[g-force]] of 3.80 through turn 7, the second ''Lesmo''.<ref name=F1.comLap/>

[[Rubens Barrichello]] recorded the fastest ever pole position lap at Monza in 2004 when he lapped in 1m20.089s, 161.802&nbsp;mph. But in the pre-qualifying session for the same race (which did not count for a grid position but only Q-running order), [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] lapped the track in 1m19.525s (162.949&nbsp;mph) which remains the fastest lap ever recorded in an F1 car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv-f1.com/Feature.aspx?Type=General&id=37200&PO=37200 |title=Monza facts and stats – Feature – F1 &#124; ITV Sport |publisher=Itv-f1.com |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=11 December 2010}}</ref>
