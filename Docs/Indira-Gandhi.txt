'''Indira Priyadarshini Gandhi''' ({{IPA-hi|ˈɪnːdɪrə ˈɡaːnd̪ʱi|lang|Hi-IndiraGandhi.ogg}}; {{née}} '''Nehru'''; 19 November 1917 – 31 October 1984) was a key 20th-century [[Politician|stateswoman]], a central figure of the [[Indian National Congress]] party, and to date the only female [[Prime Minister of India]]. Indira Gandhi was the only child of [[India]]'s first Prime Minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. She served as Prime Minister from 1966 to 1977 and then again from 1980 until [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|her assassination]] in 1984, making her the second-longest-serving Prime Minister after her father. 
  
Gandhi served as her father's personal assistant and hostess during his tenure as prime minister between 1947 and 1964.  She was elected [[Congress President]] in 1959. Upon her father's death in 1964,  Gandhi refused to enter the Congress party leadership contest and instead chose to become a cabinet minister in the government led by [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]]. In Congress' party parliamentary leadership election held in early 1966 upon the death of [[Lal Bahadur Shastri|Shastri]], she defeated her rival, [[Morarji Desai]], to become leader and thus succeed Shastri as Prime Minister of India.

As Prime Minister of India, Gandhi was known for her political ruthlessness and unprecedented [[centralisation of power]]. She went to [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war]] with [[Pakistan]] in support of the [[6 Point Movement|independence movement]] and [[Bangladesh Liberation War|war of independence]] in [[East Pakistan]], which resulted in an Indian victory and the creation of [[Bangladesh]], as well as increasing India's influence to the point where it became the regional [[hegemon]] of [[South Asia]]. Gandhi also presided over a controversial [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] from 1975 to 1977 during which she [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]]. She was assassinated in 1984 by her [[Sikh]] bodyguards a few months after she ordered the [[Operation Blue Star|storming of the Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] to counter the [[Punjab insurgency]].

==Early life and career==
Indira Gandhi was born Indira Nehru in a [[Kashmiri Pandit]] family on 19 November 1917 in [[Allahabad]].{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=13}} Her father, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], was a leading figure in India's political [[Indian Independence Movement|struggle for independence]] from [[British Raj|British rule]], and became the first Prime Minister of the [[Union of India|Union]] (and later [[Republic of India|Republic]]) of India.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=3}} She was the only child (a younger brother was born, but died young),{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=31}} and grew up with her mother, [[Kamala Nehru]], at the [[Anand Bhavan]]; a large family estate in Allahabad.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=16}} She had a lonely and unhappy childhood.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=25}} Her father was often away, directing political activities or being incarcerated in prison, while her mother was frequently bed-ridden with illness, and later suffered an early death from tuberculosis.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=32}} She had limited contact with her father, mostly through letters.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=55}}

Gandhi was mostly taught at home by tutors, and intermittently attended school until matriculation in 1934.  She was a student at the [[Modern School (New Delhi)|Modern School]] in [[Delhi]], St Cecilia's and St Mary's Christian convent schools in [[Allahabad]], the [[International School of Geneva]], the Ecole Nouvelle in [[Bex]], and the Pupils' Own School in [[Poona]] and [[Bombay]].{{sfn|Frank|2010|pp=29,75,83}} She and her mother [[Kamala Nehru]] moved to [[Belur Math]] headquarters of [[Ramakrishna Mission]] where [[Swami Ranganathananda]] was her guardian{{sfn|Indira Gandhi: Daughter of India|2002|pp=42,43,45}}  later she went on to study at the [[Viswa Bharati University]] in [[Shantiniketan]]. It was during her interview that [[Rabindranath Tagore]] named her Priyadarshini, and she came to be known as Indira Priyadarshini Nehru.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=90}} A year later, however, she had to leave university to attend to her ailing mother in [[Europe]].{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=170}} While there, it was decided that Gandhi would continue her education at the [[University of Oxford]].{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=181}} After her mother died, she briefly attended the [[Badminton School]] before enrolling at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]] in 1937 to study history.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=116}} Gandhi had to take the entrance examination twice, having failed at her first attempt with a poor performance in Latin.{{sfn|Frank|2010|p=116}} At Oxford, she did well in history, political science and economics, but her grades in Latin—a compulsory subject—remained poor.{{sfn|Somervill|2007|p=36}}{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=184}}  She did, however, have an active part within the student life of the university, such as the [[Oxford Majlis Asian Society]].<ref>http://oxfordmajlis.wix.com/majlis</ref>

During her time in Europe, Gandhi was plagued with ill-health and was constantly attended by doctors. She had to make repeated trips to Switzerland to recover, disrupting her studies. She was being treated there in 1940, when the Nazi armies rapidly conquered Europe. Gandhi tried to return to England through Portugal but was left stranded for nearly two months. She managed to enter England in early 1941, and from there returned to India without completing her studies at Oxford. The university later awarded her an honorary degree. In 2010, Oxford further honoured her by selecting her as one of the ten Oxasians, illustrious Asian graduates from the [[University of Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/100422_1.html |title=Exhibit celebrates 120 years of South Asians at Oxford |publisher=University of Oxford |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=24 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130102074542/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/100422_1.html |archivedate=2 January 2013 }}</ref>

During her stay in Great Britain, young Gandhi frequently met her future husband [[Feroze Gandhi]] (no relation to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]), whom she knew from Allahabad, and who was studying at the [[London School of Economics]]. The marriage took place in [[Allahabad]] according to [[Adi Dharm]] rituals though Feroze belonged to a [[Zorastrian]] [[Parsi]] family of Gujarat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/oldStory/82389/ |title=Sonia assures help for father-in-law’s grave |publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=21 November 2005 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>

In the 1950s, Indira, now Mrs. Indira Gandhi after her marriage, served her father unofficially as a personal assistant during his tenure as the first [[Prime Minister of India]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steinberg|first1=Blema S.|title=Women in power : the personalities and leadership styles of Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, and Margaret Thatcher|date=2008|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|location=Montreal|isbn=978-0-7735-3356-1|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=EZIBxpeRXxsC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=indira+nehru+hostess&ots=KxnZhb-GM_&sig=KTRxwvYwYf1FDPuygycMypLs4aw#v=onepage&q=indira%20nehru%20hostess&f=false|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Towards the end of the 1950s, Indira Gandhi served as the President of the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]].

==First term as Prime Minister between 1966 and 1971==
Following a poor showing in the [[Indian general election, 1967|1967 general election]], Indira Gandhi started progressively moving to the left in the political spectrum. In 1969, after falling out with senior party leaders on a number of issues, the party president [[S. Nijalingappa]] expelled her from the party.<ref name=socialism>{{cite news|title=March to socialism under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi|accessdate=25 June 2014|work=[[The Economic Times]]|agency=Bennett, Coleman & Co.

The policies of the Congress under Indira Gandhi,  prior to the 1971 elections, also included proposals for the  abolition of [[Privy Purse in India|Privy Purse]] to former rulers of the [[Princely states]] and the 1969 nationalization of the fourteen largest banks in India.

The internal structure of the Congress Party had withered following its numerous splits, leaving it entirely dependent on her leadership for its election fortunes. ''[[Garibi Hatao]]'' (Eradicate Poverty) was the theme for Gandhi's 1971 bid. On the other hand, the combined opposition alliance had a two word manifesto of "Indira Hatao" (Remove Indira).<ref name="1971.iz iz result">{{cite web|title=General Elections, India, 1971: Statistical report|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/statisticalreports/LS_1971/Vol_I_LS71.pdf|website=http://eci.nic.in/|publisher=[[Commission of India]]|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Masani,|first1=Zareer|title=The Indira Wave|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/article2950165.ece|accessdate=8 January 2015|issue=March 3, 2012|publisher=The Hindu|date=2012}}</ref>
The Garibi Hatao slogan and the proposed [[poverty reduction|anti-poverty programs]] that came with it were designed to give Gandhi an independent national support, based on rural and urban poor. This would allow her to bypass the dominant rural castes both in and of state and local governments; likewise the urban commercial class. And, for their part, the previously voiceless poor would at last gain both political worth and political weight. The programs created through [[Garibi Hatao]], though carried out locally, were funded and developed by the Central Government in New Delhi. The program was supervised and staffed by the [[Indian National Congress]] party. "These programs also provided the central political leadership with new and vast patronage resources to be disbursed... throughout the country.",<ref>{{cite journal|author=Rath, Nilakantha|title='Garibi Hatao': Can IRDP Do It?|year=1985|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=20|issue=6 |pages=238–246|jstor=4374060}}</ref>

The biggest achievement of Indira Gandhi after the 1971 election was India's decisive victory in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], that led to the formation of independent [[Bangladesh]]. Some sources claim she was hailed as Goddess Durga by opposition leader [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hellmann-Rajanayagam|first1=D|title=Dynasties and Female Political Leaders in Asia: Gender, Power and Pedigree|date=2013|publisher=LIT Verlag GMBH|location=Vienna, Zurich|isbn=978-3-643-90320-4|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=UKBcLhCxSvQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA27&dq=indira+durga+vajpayee+bangladesh&ots=ix1RPPkZ37&sig=aQ-zGKtFahKhTnPqTkjdIBChYwA#v=onepage&q=indira%20durga%20vajpayee%20bangladesh&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Puri|first1=Balraj|title=Indian Muslims since Partition|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=1993|volume=28|issue=40|page=2144|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4400229?loginSuccess=true&seq=4#page_scan_tab_contents|accessdate=30 November 2015}}</ref><ref>Sanghavi, Nagindas.

Despite the victory against Pakistan, the Congress government faced numerous problems during this term. Some of these were due to  high inflation which was in turn caused by war time expenses, drought in some parts of the country and more importantly, the [[1973 oil crisis]]. The opposition to Gandhi in 1973-75 period, after the Indira wave had receded, was strongest in Bihar and Gujarat. In Bihar, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], the veteran leader came out of retirement to lead the protest movement there.<ref name="jstor.org"/>

===Verdict on electoral malpractice===
On 12 June 1975 the [[High Courts of India|High Court of Allahabad]] declared Indira Gandhi's election to the [[Lok Sabha]] void on grounds of electoral malpractice. In an election petition filed by [[Raj Narain]] (who later on defeated her in 1977 parliamentary election from [[Raebareli|Rae Bareily]]), he had alleged several major as well as minor instances of using government resources for campaigning.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The court thus ordered her stripped of her parliamentary seat and banned from running for any office for six years. The Prime Minister must be a member of either the [[Lok Sabha]] (the lower house in the [[Parliament of India]]) or the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house). Thus, this decision effectively removed her from office. Gandhi had asked one of her colleagues in government, Mr [[Ashoke Kumar Sen]] to defend her in court.

But Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. The verdict was delivered by Mr Justice [[Jagmohanlal Sinha]] at Allahabad High Court. It came almost four years after the case was brought by Raj Narain, the premier's defeated opponent in the 1971 parliamentary election. Gandhi, who gave evidence in her defence during the trial, was found guilty of dishonest election practices, excessive election expenditure, and of using government machinery and officials for party purposes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/12/newsid_2511000/2511691.stm |work=BBC News  | title=1975: Gandhi found guilty of corruption | date=12 June 1975}}</ref> The judge, however, rejected more serious charges of bribery against her.
[[File:Indira and Nixon.JPG|thumb|upright|With [[Richard Nixon]], 1971]]
Gandhi insisted that the conviction did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, by order of the High Court. She said: "There is a lot of talk about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [opposition] parties were forming governments". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. "Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country," he said. "I believe the prime minister of India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise".

===State of Emergency (1975–1977)===
{{Main|The Emergency (India)}}
Gandhi moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. Her Cabinet and government then recommended that President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] declare a [[state of emergency]] because of the disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad High Court decision. Accordingly, Ahmed declared a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder, based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on 25 June 1975.

===Rule by decree===

Within a few months, [[President's Rule]] was imposed on the two opposition party ruled states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] thereby bringing the entire country under direct Central rule or by governments led by the ruling Congress party.<ref>Kochanek, Stanely, ''Mrs. Gandhi's Pyramid: The New Congress'', (Westview Press, Boulder, CO 1976) p. 98</ref>
Police were granted powers to impose curfews and indefinitely detain citizens and all publications were subjected to substantial censorship by the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]]. Finally, the impending legislative assembly elections were indefinitely postponed, with all opposition-controlled state governments being removed by virtue of the constitutional provision allowing for a dismissal of a state government on recommendation of the state's governor.

Indira Gandhi used the emergency provisions to change conflicting party members.
{{bq|1=
Unlike her father Jawaharlal Nehru, who preferred to deal with strong chief ministers in control of their legislative parties and state party organizations, Mrs. Gandhi set out to remove every Congress chief minister who had an independent base and to replace each of them with ministers personally loyal to her...Even so, stability could not be maintained in the states...<ref>Brass, Paul R., ''The Politics of India Since Independence'', ([[Cambridge University Press]], England 1995) p. 40</ref>}}

President Ahmed issued [[decree|ordinances]] that did not require debate in the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]], allowing Gandhi to [[rule by decree]].

===Rise of Sanjay===
The Emergency saw the entry  of Gandhi's younger son, [[Sanjay Gandhi|Sanjay]], into Indian Politics. Sanjay wielded tremendous power during the emergency without holding any Government office.  According to [[Mark Tully]], "His inexperience did not stop him from using the Draconian powers his mother, Indira Gandhi, had taken to terrorise the administration, setting up what was in effect a police state."<ref>Mark Tully ''Amritsar: Mrs. Gandhi's Last Battle'', p. 55, ISBN 81-291-0917-4</ref>

==1977 election and opposition years==
In 1977, after extending the state of emergency twice, Indira Gandhi called elections to give the electorate a chance to vindicate her rule. Gandhi may have grossly misjudged her popularity {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} by reading what the heavily censored press wrote about her. In any case, she was opposed by the Janata alliance of Opposition parties. Janata alliance, with Jai Prakash Narayan as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between "democracy and dictatorship." 
The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD (Congress for Democracy), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that.
Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. 
The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]]. The other leaders of the Janata Party were [[Charan Singh]], [[Raj Narain]], [[George Fernandes]]  and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].

===In opposition and return to power===

Since Gandhi had lost her seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed [[Yashwantrao Chavan]] as their parliamentary  party leader. Soon afterwards, the Congress party split again with Gandhi floating her own Congress (I) faction. She won a bye-election from the [[Chikamagalur]] constituency to the [[Lok sabha]] in 1978.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Maramkal|first1=M-B|title=Chikmagalur remembers Indira Gandhi|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mysuru/Chikmagalur-remembers-Indira-Gandhi/articleshow/26064352.cms|issue=November 20|publisher=Times of India|date=2013}}</ref> However, the Janata government's Home Minister, Choudhary [[Charan Singh]], ordered the arrest of her and Sanjay Gandhi on several charges, none of which would be easy to prove in an Indian court. The arrest meant that Indira Gandhi was automatically expelled from Parliament. These allegations included that she "‘had planned or thought of killing all opposition leaders in jail during the Emergency’".<ref>Malhotra, Inder. Indira Gandhi. New York: Coronet Books, 1991.</ref> In response to her arrest, Indira Gandhi's [[Bholanath and Devendra Pandey|supporters hijacked]] an Indian Airlines jet and demanded her immediate release.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2245&dat=19781221&id=ZOAzAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lDIHAAAAIBAJ&pg=3674,5934855] {{Dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref> However, this strategy backfired disastrously. Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or "that woman" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the  government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]].  The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress (I). After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979. Charan Singh was appointed Prime Minister, by President Reddy, after Indira and Sanjay Gandhi promised Singh that Congress (I) would support his government from outside on certain conditions.,<ref name="Supporting Charan Singh">{{cite book|last1=de Mesquita|first1=Bruce Bueno|title=The Predictioneer's Game: Using the Logic of Brazen Self-Interest to See and shapte the future|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8129-7977-0|page=xxiii|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=8BafGvdAYYEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA10&dq=indira+gandhi+%22charan+singh%22&ots=ipC0QGvfrR&sig=WSGY3FV2d4Ip5OHljLiajnyxsDA#v=onepage&q=%22charan%20singh%22&f=false}}</ref><ref name="Charan Singh">{{cite book|last1=Sanghvi|first1=Vijay|title=The Congress, Indira to Sonia Gandhi  By|date=2006|publisher=Kalpaz|location=Delhi|isbn=81-7835-340-7|pages=114–122|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=npdqD_TXucQC&oi=fnd&pg=PA7&dq=indira+to+soniya+congress&ots=5RE4QuraUJ&sig=BhhnMjsCiFzwZvEIrP5QX2EVork#v=onepage&q=charan&f=false}}</ref> The conditions included dropping all charges against Indira and Sanjay.

==1980 elections and third term==
The Congress (I) under Gandhi swept back to power in January 1980. Elections soon after to State assemblies across the country also brought back Congress ministries in the state with Indira's son [[Sanjay Gandhi]] choosing loyalists to lead the states. Sanjay died soon after in an air crash, early into this term. Sanjay Gandhi died instantly from head wounds in an air crash on 23 June 1980 near [[Safdarjung Airport]] in New Delhi.<sup>[[Sanjay Gandhi|[15]]]</sup> He was flying a new aircraft of the Delhi Flying club, and, while performing an [[Aerobatic maneuver|aerobatic manoeuvre]] over his office, lost control and crashed.

In the 1977 elections, a coalition led by the [[Sikh]]-majority [[Akali Dal]] came to power in the northern Indian state of Punjab.

Indian army used heavy artillery such as tanks and canons and machine guns in addition with helicopters to crush the Sikhs of Harmindar Sahib. In the resulting [[Operation Blue Star]], the shrine was damaged and many civilians were brutally massacred. Which started a swim of riot in Punjab and as a result many religious Sikh leaders as well as many devotees of Harminder Sahib were arrested, tortured and killed. Still there is a long list of missing persons from Sikh religious community of Punjab being abducted by state agencies, police and army. The State of Punjab was closed to international media, its phone and communication lines shut. To this day the events remain controversial with a disputed number of victims; Many Sikhs seeing the attack as unjustified and Bhindrawale being declared the greatest Sikh martyr of the 20th century by [[Akal Takht]] (Sikh Political Authority) in 2003.

===Assassination===

The shooting occurred as she was walking past a wicket gate guarded by Satwant and Beant.

Indira Gandhi was brought at 9:30 AM to the [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences]] where doctors operated on her. She was declared dead at 2:20 PM. The post-mortem examination was conducted by a team of doctors headed by Dr. [[T.D. Dogra]]. Dr. Dogra stated that as many as 30 bullet wounds were sustained by Indira Gandhi, from two sources, a [[Sten|Sten gun]]<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926929-2,00.html Indira Gandhi: Death in the Garden] – ''TIME''</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=8QufTc6fAocC&pg=RA1-PA135&lpg=RA1-PA135&dq=Satwant+Singh+indira&source=bl&ots=p1_zpPzvuT&sig=T4rDS9m28MGpMCfGwgfitfhMry8&hl=en&ei=ZJ36Sf_uNaGgtgOoqoTOAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5 Fighting for Faith and Nation: Dialogues With Sikh Militants] – Cynthia Keppley Mahmood – Google Books</ref> and a pistol.

===Asia-Pacific===
One of the major developments in [[Southeast Asia]] during Gandhi's premiership was the formation of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) in 1967. Relations between ASEAN and India was mutually antagonistic. ASEAN in the Indian perception was linked to the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO), and it was therefore, seen as a pro-American organisation. On their part, the ASEAN nations were unhappy with Gandhi's sympathy for the [[Viet Cong]] and India's strong links with the [[USSR]]. Furthermore, they were also apprehensions in the region about Gandhi's future plans, particularly after India played a big role in breaking up Pakistan and facilitating in the emergence of Bangladesh as a sovereign country in 1971. India's entry into the nuclear weapons club in 1974 contributed to tensions in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Nanda>{{cite book|last=Nanda|first=Prakash|title=Rediscovering Asia: Evolution of India's Look-East Policy|publisher=Lancer Publishers|isbn=978-8170622970|year=2003|pages=220–226}}</ref> Relations only began to improve following Gandhi's endorsement of the [[Zone of Peace, Freedom and Neutrality|ZOPFAN declaration]] and the disintegration of the SEATO alliance in the aftermath of Pakistani and American defeats in the region.

In one of the early interviews she had given as Prime Minister, Gandhi had ruminated: "I suppose you could call me a socialist, but you have understand what we mean by that term...we used the word [socialism] because it came closest to what we wanted to do here – which is to eradicate poverty. You can call it socialism; but if by using that word we arouse controversy, I don't see why we should use it.

[[File:Indira Gandhi and LBJ meeting in the Oval Office (1).tif|thumb|left|Indira Gandhi meeting President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in the Oval Office on 28 March 1966]]

The period of 1967–75 was characterized by socialist ascendency in India which culminated in 1976 with the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|official declaration of state socialism]]. Gandhi not only abandoned the short lived liberalization programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the ''Fourth Five-Year Plan'' in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, "growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance."{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name="Gupta">{{Cite book

}}</ref> The rationale behind the overall plan was Gandhi's ''Ten Point Programme'' of 1967. This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasized greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalization process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as "protectionist as ever."<ref name="Kirk"/>

To deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name="Rosser"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s and transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains and prone to famine to being largely able to feed itself, and become successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>

The economic period of 1967–75 became significant for its major wave of nationalisations amidst the increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name="Rosser"/>

Some of the other objectives of the economic plan for the period was to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 program were accomplished by 1974–75. Nevertheless, the success of the overall economic plan was tempered by the fact that annual growth at 3.3–3.4% over 1969–74 fell short of the targeted figure.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}

===State of Emergency and the Fifth Five Year Plan===

The Fifth Five Year Plan (1974–79) was enacted in the backdrop of the state of emergency and the ''Twenty Point Program'' of 1975.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} The latter was the economic rationale of the emergency, a political act which has often been justified on economic grounds.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} In contrast to the reception of Gandhi's earlier economic plan, this one was criticized for being a "hastily thrown together wish list."{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Gandhi promised to reduce poverty by targeting the consumption levels of the poor and enact wide ranging social and economic reforms. The government additionally targeted an annual growth of 4.4% over the period of the plan.<ref name="Growth statistics"/>

The measures of the emergency regime was able to halt the economic trouble of the early to mid-1970s, which had been marred by harvest failures, fiscal contraction, and the breakdown of the [[Bretton Woods system]] of fixed exchanged rate; the resulting turbulence in the foreign exchange markets being further accentuated by the oil shock of 1973.<ref name="Nayak"/> The government was even able to exceed the targeted growth figure with an annual growth rate of 5.0–5.2% over the five-year period of the plan (1974–79).<ref name="Growth statistics"/>{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} The economy grew at the rate of 9% in 1975–76 alone, and the Fifth Plan, became the first plan during which the per capita income of the economy grew by over 5%.<ref name="Kelly">{{Cite book

==Domestic policy==

===Nationalisation===

Despite the provisions, control and regulations of [[Reserve Bank of India]], most banks in India had continued to be owned and operated by private persons.<ref name="Gomez">{{cite book|first=Clifford|last=Gomez|title=Financial Markets Institutions And Financial Services
|location=|publisher=PHI|year=2008|page=283|isbn=978-8120335370}}</ref> Businessmen who owned the banks were often accused of channeling the deposits into their own companies, and ignoring the [[Priority sector lending|priority sector]]. Furthermore, there was a great resentment against ''class'' banking in India, which had left the poor (the majority population) [[unbanked]].<ref name="Off the record">{{cite web|author=Akshat Kaushal|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/offrecord/436974/ |title=Off the record |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=28 May 2011 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref> After becoming Prime Minister, Gandhi expressed the intention of nationalising the banks in a paper titled, ''"Stray thoughts on Bank Nationalisation"'' in order to alleviate poverty.<ref name="Muralidharan1">{{cite book|first=|last=Muralidharan|title=Modern Banking: Theory And Practice
|location=|publisher=PHI|year=2009|page=364|isbn=978-8120336551}}</ref> The paper received the overwhelming support of the public.<ref name="Muralidharan1"/> In 1969, Gandhi moved to nationalise fourteen major commercial banks. After the nationalisation of banks, the branches of the public sector banks in India rose to approximate 800 percent in deposits, and advances took a huge jump by 11,000 percent.<ref name="Muralidharan2">{{cite book|first=|last=Muralidharan|title=Modern Banking: Theory And Practice
|location=|publisher=PHI|year=2009|page=4|isbn=978-8120336551}}</ref> Nationalisation also resulted in a significant growth in the geographical coverage of banks; the number of bank branches rose from 8,200 to over 62,000, most of which were opened in the unbanked, rural areas. The nationalization drive not only helped to increase household savings, but it also provided considerable investments in the informal sector, in small and medium-sized enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed significantly to regional development and to the expansion of India’s industrial and agricultural base.<ref name="Singh">{{cite book|first=Kavaljit|last=Singh|title=Questioning Globalization

Having been re-elected in 1971 on a nationalisation platform, Gandhi proceeded to nationalise the coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton textiles, and insurance industries.<ref name="Rosser"/> Most of these nationalisations were made to protect employment and the interest of the organised labour.<ref name="Rosser"/> The remaining private sector industries were placed under strict regulatory control.<ref name="Rosser"/>

During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], foreign-owned private oil companies had refused to supply fuel to the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force. In response, Gandhi nationalised oil companies in 1973.{{citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=January 2015}} After nationalisation the oil majors such as the [[Indian Oil Corporation]] (IOC), the [[Hindustan Petroleum Corporation]] (HPCL) and the [[Bharat Petroleum Corporation]] (BPCL) had to keep a minimum stock level of oil, to be supplied to the military when needed.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ved |last=Luthra|title=Poverty And Economic Reforms|location=New Delhi|publisher=Sarup & Sons|year=2005|page=293|isbn=978-8178901367}}</ref>

===Administration===
[[File:Territorial evolution of India 1961–1975.png|left|thumb|530px|Administrative divisions of India 1961–1975. Gandhi established six states, [[Haryana]] (1966), [[Himachal Pradesh]] (1971), [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]] (all 1972), and finally [[Sikkim]] (1975), bringing up the total of states to 22. She also established [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Mizoram]] (1972) as Union Territories]]

In 1966, Gandhi [[Punjabi Suba movement|accepted the demands]] of the [[Akali Dal|Akali's]] to reorganize [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] on linguistic lines. The [[Hindi]]-speaking southern half of Punjab became a separate state, [[Haryana]], while the [[Pahari languages|Pahari]] speaking hilly areas in the north east were joined to [[Himachal Pradesh]].{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=302}} In doing so, she had hoped to ward off [[Punjabi Suba#Background|the growing political conflict]] between [[Hindu]] and [[Sikh]] groups in the region.{{sfn|Gupte|2012|p=302}} However, a contentious issue that was considered unresolved by the Akali's was the status of [[Chandigarh]], a prosperous city on the Punjab-Haryana border, which Gandhi declared a union territory to be shared as a capital by both the states.<ref name="Pletcher">{{cite book|first= Kenneth|last=Pletcher|title=The History of India|location=|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2010|page=315|isbn=978-1615302017}}</ref>

Victory over Pakistan in 1971 consolidated Indian power in Kashmir. Gandhi indicated that she would make no major concessions on Kashmir. The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists, [[Sheikh Abdullah]], had to recognize India's control over Kashmir in light of the new order in South Asia. The situation was normalized in the years following the war after Abdullah [[1974 Indira–Sheikh accord|agreed to an accord]] with Gandhi, by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in return for a [[Article 370|special autonomous status for Kashmir]]. In 1975, Gandhi declared the state of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] as a constituent unit of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely peaceful if frozen under Gandhi's premiership.<ref>{{cite book|first=Jayanta|last=Kumar Ray|title=Aspects of India's International Relations, 1700 to 2000: South Asia and the World|location=|publisher=Pearson|year=2007|page=493|isbn=978-8131708347}}</ref>

In 1972, Gandhi granted statehood to [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Tripura]], while the [[North-East Frontier Agency]] was declared a union territory and renamed [[Arunachal Pradesh]]. The transition to statehood for these territories was successfully overseen by her administration.<ref name="Chandra 2007b"/> This was followed by the annexation of [[Sikkim]] in 1975.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=120-121}}

===Social reform===
The principle of equal pay for equal work for both men and women was enshrined in the Indian Constitution under the Gandhi administration.<ref name="Sarkar ">{{Cite book

Gandhi questioned the continued existence of a [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse]] for Indian monarchs. She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the [[Jana Sangh]] and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] in 1970. It was passed in the [[Lok Sabha]] but felt short of the two-thirds majority in the [[Rajya Sabha]] by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognizing the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse. This time, it was successfully passed as the [[List of amendments of the Constitution of India|26th Amendment to the Constitution of India]].<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> Many royals tried to protest the abolition of the privy purse, primarily through campaigns to contest seats in elections. They, however, received a final setback when many of them were defeated by huge margins.

Gandhi claimed that only "clear vision, iron will and the strictest discipline" can remove poverty.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> She justified the imposition of the state of emergency in 1975 in the name of the socialist mission of the Congress.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> Armed with the power to rule by decree and without constitutional constraints, Gandhi embarked on a massive redistribution program.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> The provisions included rapid enforcement of land ceilings, housing for landless labourers, the abolition of bonded labour and a moratorium on the debts of the poor.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> North India was at the centre of the reforms; millions of acres of land were acquired and redistributed.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> The government was also successful in procuring houses for landless labourers; according to [[Francine R. Frankel|Frankel]], three-fourths of the targeted four million houses was achieved in 1975 alone.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> Nevertheless, others have disputed the success of the program and criticized Gandhi for not doing enough to reform land ownership. The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned "...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?"<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to "talk left and act right", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> [[J. Barkley Rosser, Jr.|Rosser]] wrote that "some have even seen the declaration of emergency rule in 1975 as a move to suppress dissent against Gandhi's policy shift to the right."<ref name="Rosser"/> Regardless of the controversy over the nature of the reforms, the long-term effects of the social changes gave rise to prominence of middle-ranking farmers from intermediate and lower castes in North India.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/> The rise of these newly empowered social classes challenged the political establishment of the [[Hindi Belt]] in the years to come.<ref name="Jaffrelot"/>

===Language policy===
Under the [[Indian Constitution]] of 1950, Hindi was to have become the official national language by 1965. This was not acceptable to many non-Hindi speaking states, who wanted the continued use of English in government. In 1967, Gandhi made a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official languages. This established the official government policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied the non-Hindi speaking Indian states.<ref name="Steinberg"/> Gandhi thus put herself forward as a leader with a pan-Indian vision.<ref name="Chandra 2007">{{Cite book

===National security===
In the late 1960s and 1970s, Gandhi had the Indian army crush [[Naxalite#Violence in West Bengal|militant Communist uprisings]] in the Indian state of [[West Bengal]]. The communist insurgency in India was completely suppressed during the [[Indian Emergency (1975-1977)|state of emergency]].<ref name="Hamlet">{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/news/hamlet-and-the-naxals-news-defence-jgsnxMbjcdh.html |title=Hamlet and the Naxals |publisher=Sify.com |accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="Naxalites">[http://www.watershed.com.br/article/208/naxalites-who-are-they-and-what-are-their-demands.aspx Naxalites: who are they and what are their demands?]</ref><ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/NM2/History-of-Naxalism/Article1-6545.aspx |title=History of Naxalism |publisher=Hindustantimes.com |date=15 December 2005 |accessdate=31 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130722091758/http://www.hindustantimes.com:80/News-Feed/NM2/History-of-Naxalism/Article1-6545.aspx |archivedate=22 July 2013 }}</ref><ref name="break">{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/indira-gandhi-used-army-to-break-naxals-retired-general-30840 |title=Indira Gandhi used Army to break Naxals: Retired General |publisher=Ndtv.com |date=10 June 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>

===Nuclear Program of India===
{{Main|Indian nuclear programme|Smiling Buddha}}
Gandhi contributed and further carried out the vision of [[Jawarharalal Nehru]], former Premier of India to develop the program. Gandhi authorised the development of nuclear weapons in 1967, in response to the ''[[Test No. 6]]'' by People's Republic of China. Gandhi saw this test as Chinese nuclear intimidation, therefore, Gandhi promoted the views of Nehru to establish India's stability and security interests as independent from those of the nuclear superpowers.

The program became fully mature in 1974, when Dr. [[Raja Ramanna]] reported to Gandhi that India had the ability to test its first nuclear weapon. Gandhi gave verbal authorisation of this [[nuclear testing|test]], and preparations were made in a long-constructed army base, the [[Indian Army]] [[Pokhran Test Range]]. In 1974, India successfully conducted an underground nuclear test, unofficially code named as "''[[Smiling Buddha]]''", near the desert village of [[Pokhran]] in Rajasthan. As the world was quiet by this test, a vehement protest came forward from Pakistan. Great ire was raised in Pakistan and its Prime Minister, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], described this test as "''Indian hegemony''" to intimidate Pakistan. In response to this [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] launched a massive campaign all over the Pakistan to make Pakistan a nuclear power. In these campaigns [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] asked the nation to get united and great slogans were raised such as ''hum ghaas kha lay gay magar nuclear power ban k rhe gay (we would eat grass but would surely achieve nuclear power)''. Gandhi directed a letter to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] and, later to the world, describing the test for [[Peaceful nuclear explosions|peaceful purposes]] and India's commitment to develop its programme for industrial and scientific use.

==Family and personal life==

A member of the [[Nehru-Gandhi family]], she was married to [[Feroze Gandhi]] at the age of 25, in 1942. Their marriage lasted for 18 years, until Feroze died after a [[heart attack]] in 1960. They had two sons - [[Rajiv Gandhi|Rajiv]] (b. 1944) and [[Sanjay Gandhi|Sanjay]] (b. 1946). Her younger son Sanjay had initially been her chosen heir; but after his death in a flying accident in June 1980, Gandhi  persuaded her reluctant elder son Rajiv to quit his job as a pilot and enter politics in February 1981. Rajiv took office as [[Prime Minister of India|prime minister]] following his mother's [[Assassination of Indira Gandhi|assassination]] in 1984; he served until December 1989. Rajiv Gandhi  himself was assassinated by a suicide bomber working on behalf of [[Tamil tigers]] on May 21, 1991.
