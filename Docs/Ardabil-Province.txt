'''Ardabil Province''' ({{lang-fa|استان اردبیل}}, ''Ostān-e Ardabīl'' {{lang-az|اردبیل اوستانی}}) is one of the thirty-one [[provinces of Iran]]. It is in the [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|northwest]] of the country, in [[Regions of Iran|Regions]] [[Region 3, Iran|3]], bordering the [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]], the provinces of [[East Azerbaijan Province|East Azerbaijan]], [[Zanjan Province|Zanjan]], and [[Gilan Province|Gilan]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=22 June 2014 (1 Tir 1393, Jalaali)|title= همشهری آنلاین-استان‌های کشور به ۵ منطقه تقسیم شدند (Provinces were divided into 5 regions)|language=Persian|newspaper=Hamshahri Online|url=http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/details/263382/Iran/-provinces|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623191332/http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/details/263382/Iran/-provinces|archivedate=23 June 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref> Its administrative centre is the city of [[Ardabil]].  The province was established in 1993 from the eastern part of East Azerbaijan.

==Climate and geography==
[[File:Alvars1.jpg|thumb|Alvars, Ardabil]]
Many tourists come to the region for its cool climate (max 35&nbsp;°C) during the hot summer months. The winters are bitterly cold, with temperatures plummeting to −25&nbsp;°C.

Its famous natural region is the [[Sabalan]] mountains. The province is considered the coldest province in Iran by many. Large parts of the province are green and forested.

Famous athletes such as [[Ali Daei]] and [[Hossein Rezazade]] are originally from Ardabil.

Ardabil's capital stands about 70&nbsp;km from the [[Caspian Sea]] and has an area of 18011&nbsp;km². Neighbouring the [[Caspian Sea]] and the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]], the city is of great political and economic significance.
The province has been blessed with splendid natural beauty and numerous sights.

==History==

The natural features of the province of Ardabil are mentioned in the [[Avesta]], according to which [[Zoroaster]] was born by the river [[Aras River|Aras]] and wrote his book in the [[Sabalan]] Mountains. During the [[Islamic conquest of Iran]], Ardabil was the largest city in [[Azarbaijan]], and remained so until the [[Mongols|Mongol]] invasion period.

Shah [[Ismail I]] started his campaign to nationalize Iran's government and land from here, but consequently announced [[Tabriz]] as his capital in 1500 [[Common Era|CE]]. Yet Ardabil remained an important city both politically and economically until modern times.

==Administrative divisions==
The province is divided into 10 [[Counties of Iran|counties]]: [[Ardabil County|Ardabil]], [[Bilasavar County|Bilasavar]], [[Germi County|Germi]], [[Khalkhal County|Khalkhal]], [[Kowsar County|Kowsar]], [[Meshginshahr County|Meshginshahr]], [[Namin County|Namin]], [[Sarein]], [[Nir County|Nir]], and [[Parsabad County|Parsabad]]. District of [[Arasbaran]] was transferred to the province of [[Ardabil]] from [[East Azerbaijan]] in 2010 and now appears on the more recent maps of Ardabil Province produced by the Iranian official organs.

Ardabil is the seat of the sanctuary and tomb of [[Shaikh]] [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili|Safî ad-Dîn]], [[eponym]] of the [[Safavid Dynasty]] [[Kulliye]].
It has many hot springs and beautiful natural landscapes and these attract tourists. The mineral springs of Ardabil are Beele-Darreh, [[Sareyn]], Sardabeh and Booshloo, which are famed throughout Iran for their medicinal qualities.
It also has many beauty lakes: the largest of which are Ne'or, Shoorabil, ShoorGel, NouShahr and Alooche, which are the habitats of some species of water birds.

The beautiful Lake Ne'or is located in a mountainous area 48&nbsp;km south-east of the city of Ardabil. It covers an area of 2.1&nbsp;km² and has an average depth of 3 metres. It is fed by springs in the lake bed. Lake Shoorabil is located in a hilly area south of the city of Ardabil and covers an area of 640,000 m². The surface of the lake is covered with a thin white layer of minerals, which is useful for healing skin diseases and rheumatism. Near the lake there is the leisure complex of Shoorabil.
''Ardabil is a city of great antiquity. Its origins go back 4000 to 6000 years (according to historical research in this city).'' This city was the capital of Azerbaijan province in different times, but its golden age was in the [[Safavid]] period.
