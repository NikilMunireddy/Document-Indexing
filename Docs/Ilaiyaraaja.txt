===Impact and musical style===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ilaiyaraja at the recording studio.jpg|thumb|250x147px|Ilaiyaraaja and musicians during recording sessions of ''Chinnathambi'']] -->
Ilaiyaraaja was one of the earliest Indian film composers to use Western classical music harmonies and string arrangements in Indian film music.<ref name="filmmusicthenewinterculturalidiomp.110">Venkatraman, S. 1995. "Film music: the new intercultural idiom of 20th century Indian music". pp. 107–112 in A. Euba and C.T. Kimberlin (eds.). ''Intercultural Music Vol. I''. Bayreuth: Breitinger (p. 110).</ref> This allowed him to craft a rich tapestry of sounds for films, and his themes and background score gained notice and appreciation among Indian film audiences.<ref>Venkatraman, S. 1995. "Film music: the new intercultural idiom of 20th century Indian music". pp. 107–112 in A. Euba and C.T. Kimberlin (eds.). ''Intercultural Music Vol. I''. Bayreuth: Breitinger (p. 111).</ref> The range of expressive possibilities in Indian film music was broadened by Ilaiyaraaja's methodical approach to arranging, recording technique, and his drawing of ideas from a diversity of musical styles.<ref name="filmmusicthenewinterculturalidiomp.110" />

According to musicologist P. Greene, Ilaiyaraaja's "deep understanding of so many different styles of music allowed him to create syncretic pieces of music combining very different musical idioms in unified, coherent musical statements".<ref name="filmmusicsouthernareap.544" /> Ilaiyaraaja has composed Indian film songs that amalgamated elements of [[genre]]s such as
Afro-tribal, [[bossa nova]], [[dance music]] (e.g., [[disco]]), [[doo-wop]], [[flamenco]], [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]]-propelled [[Folk music#The emergence of popular folk artists|Western folk]], [[funk]], [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]], [[Indian folk music|Indian folk/traditional]], [[jazz]], [[American march music#Musicality and the march music form|march]], [[pathos]], [[pop music|pop]], [[Psychedelic music|psychedelia]] and [[rock and roll]].

By virtue of this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and [[Carnatic music|Carnatic]] elements, Ilaiyaraaja's compositions appeal to the Indian rural dweller for its [[rhythm]]ic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic ''[[Raga]]s'', and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound.<ref>Greene, P.D. 1997. Film music: Southern area. Pp. 542–546 in B. Nettl, R.M. Stone, J. Porter and T. Rice (eds.). ''The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music. Volume V: South Asia&nbsp;— The Indian Subcontinent''. New York: Garland Pub. (p. 545).</ref> Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline of the running movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.<ref name="musical_man" />

Although Ilaiyaraaja uses a range of complex compositional techniques, he often sketches out the basic melodic ideas for films in a very spontaneous fashion.<ref name="Ilaiyarajacomposerasphenomenon" /><ref name="filmmusicsouthernareap.544" />

==Musical characteristics==
Ilaiyaraaja's music is characterised by the use of an orchestration technique that is a synthesis of Western and Indian instruments and musical modes. He uses electronic music technology that integrates [[synthesizer]]s, electric guitars and [[Electronic keyboard|keyboards]], drum machines, rhythm boxes and [[MIDI]] with large orchestras that feature traditional instruments such as the ''[[veena]]'', ''[[venu]]'', ''[[nadaswaram]]'', ''[[dholak]]'', ''[[mridangam]]'' and ''[[tabla]]'' as well as Western lead instruments such as saxophones and flutes.<ref name="filmmusicsouthernareap.544" />

The [[bassline]]s in his songs tend to be melodically dynamic, rising and falling in a dramatic fashion. [[Polyrhythm]]s are also apparent, particularly in songs with Indian folk or Carnatic influences. The melodic structure of his songs demand considerable vocal virtuosity, and have found expressive platform amongst some of India's respected vocalists and [[playback singer]]s, such as [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]], [[T. M. Soundararajan]], [[K. J. Yesudas]], [[S. P. Balasubrahmanyam]], [[S. Janaki]], [[P. Susheela]], [[Asha Bhosle]], [[Lata Mangeshkar]], [[Jayachandran]], [[S. P. Sailaja]], [[Jency]], [[Swarnalatha]], [[K. S. Chithra]], [[Minmini]], [[Sujatha Mohan|Sujatha]], [[Malaysia Vasudevan]], [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]], [[Hariharan (singer)|Hariharan]], [[Udit Narayan]], [[Sadhana Sargam]] and [[Shreya Ghoshal]]. Ilaiyaraaja has sung over 400 of his own compositions for films, and is recognisable by his stark, deep voice. He has penned the lyrics for some of his songs in Tamil.<ref>Rangarajan, M. [http://www.hindu.com/fr/2004/10/15/stories/2004101502460500.htm "From Texas to tinsel town".] ''The Hindu'', 15 October 2004. Accessed 2007-02-01.</ref><ref>Ashok Kumar, S.R.

==Non-cinematic output==
[[File:Ilaiyaraja - Thiruvasakam.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Thiruvasakam album cover, a symphony oratorio based on ancient Tamil poem.]]
Ilaiyaraaja's first two non-film albums were explorations in the fusion of Indian and Western classical music. The first, ''[[How to Name It?]]'' (1986), is dedicated to the Carnatic master [[Tyagaraja|Tyāgarāja]] and to J. S. Bach. It features a fusion of the Carnatic form and ''ragas'' with Bach [[partita]]s, [[fugue]]s and [[Baroque]] musical textures.<ref>Greene, P.D. 1997. Film music: Southern area. Pp. 542–546 in B.

He has composed a set of Carnatic ''[[kriti]]s'' that was recorded by electric mandolinist [[U. Srinivas]] for the album ''Ilayaraaja's Classicals on the Mandolin'' (1994). Ilaiyaraaja has also composed albums of religious/[[Bhakti|devotional]] songs. His ''Guru Ramana Geetam'' (2004) is a cycle of prayer songs inspired by the Hindu mystic [[Ramana Maharshi]], and his ''[[Thiruvasakam]]: A crossover'' (2005) is an [[oratorio]] of ancient Tamil poems transcribed partially in English by American lyricist [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] and performed by the [[Budapest Symphony Orchestra]].<ref>Viswanathan, S. 2005.
