'''County Tyrone''' ({{Irish derived place name|Tír Eoghain|land of [[Eoghan]]}}) is one of the six [[Counties of Northern Ireland|counties]] of [[Northern Ireland]]. Adjoined to the south-west shore of [[Lough Neagh]], the county covers an area of 3,155&nbsp;km² (1218 sq mi) and has a population of about 177,986, with its county town being [[Omagh]]. It is also one of the thirty-two traditional [[counties of Ireland]] and is within the historic [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]].

Tyrone is the eighth largest of Ireland's thirty-two counties by area and tenth largest by population.<ref>{{cite book|first=Eoghan|last=Corry|title=The GAA Book of Lists| publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland|year=2005|pages=186–191|isbn=0-340-89695-7}}</ref> It is the second largest of Ulster's nine counties by area and fourth largest by population.<ref>Marie Veronica Tarpey [https://books.google.com/books?id=PgeWfj_rJtMC&pg=PA22 The role of Joseph McGarrity in the struggle for Irish independence]</ref> The county is no longer used as an administrative division for local government purposes, but retains a strong identity in popular culture.

==Name==
The name ''Tyrone'' is derived {{etymology|ga|Tír Eoghain|land of [[Eógan mac Néill|Eoghan]]}}, the name given to the conquests made by the [[Cenél nEógain]] from the provinces of [[Airgíalla]] and [[Ulaid]].<ref name="Cosgrove">Art Cosgrove (2008); "A New History of Ireland, Volume II: Medieval Ireland 1169-1534". Oxford University Press.</ref> Historically, it was anglicised as ''Tirowen'' or ''Tyrowen'', which are closer to the Irish pronunciation.

Historically Tyrone stretched as far north as [[Lough Foyle]], and comprised part of modern-day [[County Londonderry]] east of the [[River Foyle]]. The majority of County Londonderry was carved out of Tyrone between 1610–1620 when that land went to the Guilds of London to set up profit making schemes based on natural resources located there. Tyrone was the traditional stronghold of the various O'Neill clans and families, the strongest of the Gaelic Irish families in [[Ulster]], surviving into the seventeenth century. The ancient principality of Tír Eoghain, the inheritance of the O'Neills, included the whole of the present counties of Tyrone and Londonderry, and the four [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of West [[Inishowen]], East Inishowen, [[Raphoe]] North and Raphoe South in [[County Donegal]].<ref name="LI">{{cite web|title=Description of County Tyrone from ''Atlas and Cyclopedia of Ireland'' (1900)|work=Library Ireland|url=http://www.libraryireland.com/Atlas/Tyrone.php|accessdate=24 February 2009}}</ref>

In 1608 during [[O'Doherty's Rebellion]] areas of the country were plundered and burnt by the forces of Sir [[Cahir O'Doherty]] following his [[Burning of Derry|destruction of Derry]]. However, O'Doherty's men avoided the estates of the recently fled [[Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone|Earl of Tyrone]] around [[Dungannon]], fearing Tyrone's anger if he returned from his exile.<ref>McCavitt, John. ''The Flight of the Earls''. Gill & MacMillan, 2002. p.143-44</ref>

==Geography==
With an area of {{convert|3155|km2|sqmi}}, Tyrone is the largest county in Northern Ireland. The flat peatlands of East Tyrone border the shoreline of the largest lake in the British Isles, [[Lough Neagh]], rising gradually across to the more mountainous terrain in the west of the county, the area surrounding the [[Sperrins|Sperrin Mountains]], the highest point being [[Sawel Mountain]] at a height of 678 m (2,224&nbsp;ft). The length of the county, from the mouth of the [[River Blackwater, Northern Ireland|River Blackwater]] at Lough Neagh to the western point near Carrickaduff hill is {{convert|55|mi|km}}. The breadth, from the southern corner, southeast of [[Fivemiletown]], to the northeastern corner near Meenard Mountain is {{convert|37.5|mi|km}}; giving an area of 1,260 square miles (in 1900).<ref name="LI"/> Annaghone lays claim to be the [[Centre points of the United Kingdom|geographical centre]] of Northern Ireland.

Tyrone is connected by land to the county of [[Fermanagh]] to the southwest; [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] to the south; [[County Armagh|Armagh]] to the southeast; [[County Londonderry | Londonderry]] to the north; and [[County Donegal|Donegal]] to the west. Across Lough Neagh to the east, it borders [[County Antrim]].

==Sport==
The major sports in Tyrone are [[Gaelic games]], Association football and [[Rugby Union]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*[[Gaelic football]] is more widely played than [[hurling]].  The [[Tyrone GAA]] football side has had considerable success since 2000, winning three [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All Ireland titles]] (in 2003, 2005 and 2008), they have also won thirteen [[Ulster Senior Football Championship|Ulster titles]] (1956, 1957, 1973, 1984, 1986, 1989, 1995, 1996, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010)<ref>The Tyrone GAA team have won the Ulster Senior Championship on eight occasions in the 20th century</ref> and two [[National Football League (Ireland)|National League titles]] (in 2002 and 2003). {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
**Underage Gaelic football teams have also had considerable successes on the field at both provincial and national level – winning the [[All-Ireland Minor Football Championship]] seven times (the most recent, also in 2010) and the [[All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship]] four times.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*Association Football also has a large following. [[Omagh Town F.C.]] were members of the [[NIFL Premiership|Irish Football League]] until they folded in 2005 due to financial problems. [[Dungannon Swifts F.C.]] compete in the [[NIFL Premiership]] - the top division. Other teams include [[NIFL Championship]] sides [[Coagh United F.C.]] and [[Dergview F.C.]].
*[[Rugby Union]] is very popular in the county. [[Dungannon RFC]] are one of only three Ulster teams currently playing in All Ireland League One. Other teams include Omagh RFC, Clogher Valley RFC, Cookstown RFC and Strabane RFC.
