The '''Crimean Peninsula''' (<!-- NOTE: Russian is listed first because it is the predominant language of the region; languages are listed in order of percent of users in region -->{{lang-ru|Кры́мский полуо́стров}}; {{lang-uk|Кри́мський піво́стрів}}; {{lang-crh|Къырым ярымадасы}}), also known simply as '''Crimea''' ({{IPAc-en|k|r|aɪ|ˈ|m|iː|ə}}; {{lang-ru|Крым}} {{lang-uk|Крим}}; {{lang-crh|Къырым}}), is a major land mass on the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]] that is almost completely surrounded by both the Black Sea and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]] to the northeast. The [[peninsula]] is located south of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] region of [[Kherson Oblast|Kherson]] and west of the Russian region of [[Kuban]].  It is connected to Kherson Oblast by the [[Isthmus of Perekop]] and is separated from Kuban by the [[Strait of Kerch]]. The [[Arabat Spit]] is located to the northeast, a narrow strip of land that separates a system of lagoons named [[Sivash]] from the Sea of Azov.

Crimea—or the '''[[History of Crimea#Antiquity|Tauric Peninsula]]''', as it was called from antiquity until the [[early modern period]]—has historically been at the boundary between the [[Classical antiquity|classical world]] and the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]]. Its southern fringe was colonised by the [[Greek colonies|ancient Greeks]], the [[Roman Crimea|ancient Romans]], the [[Cherson (theme)|Byzantine Empire]], the [[Principality of Theodoro|Crimean Goths]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], while at the same time its interior was occupied by a changing cast of invading [[steppe nomads]], such as the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], [[Sarmatians]], [[Goths]], [[Alans]], [[Bulgars]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Kipchaks]], and the [[Golden Horde]]. Crimea and adjacent territories were united in the [[Crimean Khanate]] during the 15th to 18th century.

In 1783, Crimea was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Empire|annexed]] by the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, Crimea became a [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|republic]] within the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]], though later, during [[World War Two]], it was downgraded to the [[Crimean Oblast]]. In 1954, the Crimean Oblast was [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] to the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. It became the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within newly independent Ukraine in 1991, with [[Sevastopol]] having its own administration, within Ukraine but outside of the Autonomous Republic.

In March 2014, following the ousting of the Ukrainian president in the [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]] and the subsequent takeover of the region by pro-Russian separatists and [[Russian military intervention in Ukraine (2014–present)|Russian special forces]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/putin-was-surprised-at-how-easily-russia-took-control-of-crimea/2015/03/15/94b7c82e-c9c1-11e4-bea5-b893e7ac3fb3_story.html|title=Putin Details Crimea Takeover Before First Anniversary|work=Washington Post|accessdate= 11 June 2015|first=Michael|last=Birnbaum|date=15 March 2015}}</ref> an unauthorised<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2355.aspx|publisher=US Treasury |title=Treasury Designates Seven Individuals And One Entity Contributing To The Situation In Ukraine| date=11 April 2014| accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref> [[Crimean referendum, 2014|referendum]] on the issue of "reunification with Russia" was held which returned a large majority in support of the proposal.

Ukraine, backed by most of the international community, [[political status of Crimea|refuses to accept]] the annexation and continues to assert its right over the peninsula.

==Name==
{{Further|Stary Krym}}

The classical name ''[[History of Crimea#Antiquity|Tauris]]'' or ''Taurica'' is from the Greek  Ταυρική, after the peninsula's Scytho-Cimmerian inhabitants, the [[Tauri]]. [[Strabo]] and [[Ptolemy]] refer to the [[Strait of Kerch]] as the ''Bosporus Cimmerius'', and to ''Cimmerium'' as the capital of the Taurida, whence the peninsula, or its [[Kerch Peninsula|easternmost part]], was also named ''Promontorium Cimmerium'' (Κιμμέριον ἄκρον).<ref name="history1779">{{cite book|author=Compiled from original authors|title=An Universal History, from the Earliest Accounts to the Present Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CCsIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA129|accessdate=1 April 2015|year=1779|pages=127–129|chapter=The History of the Bosporus}}</ref><ref>Claudii Ptolemaei.

The classical name was revived in 1802 in the name of the Russian [[Taurida Governorate]].<ref>Edith Hall, ''Adventures with Iphigenia in Tauris'' (2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=CjwfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA176 p. 176]:
"it was indeed at some point between the 1730s and the 1770s that the dream of recreating ancient 'Taurida' in the southern Crimea was conceived. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]]'s plan was to create a paradisiacal imperial 'garden' there, and her Greek archbishop [[Eugenios Voulgaris]] obliged by inventing a new etymology for the old name of Tauris, deriving it from ''taphros'', which (he claimed) was the ancient Greek for a ditch dug by human hands."</ref> While it was abandoned in the Soviet Union, and has had no official status since 1921, it is still used by some institutions in Crimea, such as the [[Taurida National University]], or the [[FC Tavriya Simferopol|Tavriya Simferopol football club]].

{{main|History of Crimea}}
In the 8th century BCE the [[Cimmerians]] migrated to the region and subsequently the [[Scythians]] as well it being the site of [[Greeks in pre-Roman Crimea|Greek colonies]]. The most important city was [[Chersonesus (Crimea)|Chersonesos]] at the edge of today's Sevastopol.

Later occupiers included the [[Roman Crimea|Romans]], [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Bulgars]], [[Khazars]], the state of [[Kievan Rus']], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Kipchaks]], and the [[Golden Horde]]. In the 13th century CE, portions were controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]] and by the [[Republic of Genoa]].

In the 9th century CE, Byzantium established the [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson theme]] to fend against incursions by the [[Rus' Khaganate]], and the Crimean peninsula from this time was contested between Byzantium, Rus' and [[Khazaria]]. The area remained the site of overlapping interests and contact between the early medieval Slavic, Turkic and Greek spheres, and became a center of [[Saqaliba|slave trade]], [[early Slavs|Slavs]] were sold to Byzantium and other places in Anatolia and the Middle-East during this period. Trapezuntine [[Perateia]] had already been subjected to pressure from the Genoese and Kipchaks by the time [[Alexios I of Trebizond]] died in 1222 before the [[Mongol invasions]] swept through in 1223. With them, the peninsula's status quo changed in the 1230s as all but the Perateia of Crimea was incorporated into the territory of the Golden Horde throughout the 14th century CE. Two portions of the Perateia soon became the [[Principality of Theodoro]] and [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Genoese Gazaria]].

The [[Taurida Oblast]] was created by a decree of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] on 2 February 1784. The center of the [[oblast]] was first in [[Karasubazar]] but was moved to Simferopol later in 1784. The establishment decree divided the oblast into 7 [[uyezd]]s. However, by a decree of [[Paul I of Russia|Paul I]] on 12 December 1796, the oblast was abolished and the territory, divided into 2 uyezds (Akmechetsky ''[Акмечетский]'' and Perekopsky ''[Перекопский]'') was attached to the second incarnation of the [[Novorossiysk Governorate]].

From 1853 to 1856, the peninsula was the site of the principal engagements of the [[Crimean War]], a conflict fought between the Russian Empire and an alliance of [[Second French Empire|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], the Ottoman Empire and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Crimean War (1853-1856)|journal=Gale Encyclopedia of World History: War|date=2008|volume=2|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/01/crimean-war-1853-1856.html}}</ref>

=== Russian Civil War (1917–1921)===
{{see also|Crimean People's Republic|Taurida Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean Regional Government|Crimean Socialist Soviet Republic}}
Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the military and political situation in Crimea was chaotic like that in much of Russia. During the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]], Crimea changed hands numerous times and was for a time a stronghold of the anti-Bolshevik [[White movement|White Army]]. The [[White Army]] controlled Crimea before remnants were finally driven out by the [[Red Army]] in November 1920. It was in Crimea that the White Russians led by [[Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel|General Wrangel]] made their last stand against [[Nestor Makhno]] and the Red Army. When resistance was crushed, many of the anti-Communist fighters and civilians escaped by ship to [[Istanbul]]. Between 56 000 and 150 000 of the Whites were murdered as part of the [[Red Terror]].

===Soviet Union (1921–1991)===
{{see also|Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean Oblast}}
Crimea became part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] in 1921 as the [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], which became part of the Soviet Union in 1922.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] the peninsula was [[Crimean Campaign|invaded]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Romanian troops]] in summer 1941 across the [[Isthmus of Perekop]]. Following the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|capture of Sevastopol]] on 4 July 1942, the Crimea was occupied until German and Romanian forces were expelled in an [[Crimean Offensive|offensive]] by Soviet forces ending in May 1944. On 25 June 1946, it was downgraded to the Crimean Oblast, and the [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatars were deported]] for alleged collaboration with the [[Nazism|Nazi]] forces. A total of more than 230,000 people - about a fifth of the total population of the Crimean Peninsula at that time - were deported, mainly to [[Uzbekistan]]. 12,075 Bulgarians, 14,300 Greeks and about 10,000 Armenians were also expelled.

In post-war years, Crimea thrived as a [[tourist destination]], with new attractions and sanatoriums for tourists. Tourists came from all around the Soviet Union and neighbouring countries, particularly from the [[German Democratic Republic]].<ref name="blacksea-crimea/hist">{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/history1.html |title=History |accessdate=March 28, 2007 |work=blacksea-crimea.com}}</ref> In time the peninsula also became a major tourist destination for cruises originating in Greece and Turkey. Crimea's infrastructure and manufacturing also developed, particularly around the sea ports at [[Kerch]] and [[Sevastopol]] and in the oblast's landlocked capital, [[Simferopol]]. Populations of [[Ukrainians]] and [[Russians]] alike doubled, with more than 1.6 million Russians and 626,000 Ukrainians living on the peninsula by 1989.<ref name="blacksea-crimea/hist" />

==Geography==
{{further|East European Plain}}
Covering an area of {{convert|27000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|0}}, Crimea is located on the northern coast of the Black Sea and on the western coast of the [[Sea of Azov]], the only land border is shared with Ukraine's [[Kherson Oblast]] from the north.

The natural border between the Crimean Peninsula and the Ukrainian mainland is formed by the [[Sivash]] or "Rotten Sea", a large system of shallow lagoons. The peninsula is connected to the Kherson Oblast's [[Henichesk Raion]], and thus the European mainland, via the  [[Isthmus of Perekop]], a strip of land about  {{convert|5|–|7|km|mi|1}} wide, as well as by bridges over the narrow Chongar and Henichesk straits. The northern part of Arabat Spit is administratively part of Henichesk Raion in Kherson Oblast, including its two rural communities of [[Shchaslyvtseve]] and [[Strilkove]]. The eastern tip of the peninsula is the [[Kerch Peninsula]], separated from [[Taman Peninsula]] on the Russian mainland by the [[Kerch Strait]], which connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov, at a width of between {{convert|3|–|13|km|mi|1}}.

Geographically, the peninsula is generally divided into three zones: [[Pontic steppe|steppe]], [[Crimean Mountains|mountains]] and [[Crimean coast|southern coast]].

===Coastline===
{{further|Black Sea|Sea of Azov}}
[[File:Kanaka. Crimea. Urraine.jpg|thumb|200px|South coast of Crimea]]
The Crimean peninsula comprises many smaller peninsulas, such as the mentioned [[Kerch peninsula]], [[Heracles Peninsula]], [[Tarkhankut Peninsula]] and many others. Crimea also possesses lots of headlands such as [[Cape Priboiny]], [[Cape Tarkhankut]], [[Sarych]], [[Cape Fonar]], [[Kazantyp]], [[Cape Akburun]], and many others.

The Crimean coastline is broken by several bays and harbors. These harbors lie west of the [[Isthmus of Perekop]] by the Bay of Karkinit; on the southwest by the open Bay of Kalamita between the port cities of [[Eupatoria]] and Sevastopol.

The [[Kerch Peninsula]] is attached to  the Crimean mainland by Isthmus of Yenikale, delimited by the    [[Bay of Arabat]] to the north (interrputed by the incoming [[Arabat Spit]]),  and the Bay of Caffa{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} to the south (arching eastward from the port of [[Feodosiya]]).

===Crimean Mountains===
{{main|Crimean Mountains}}
[[File:Eclizee-burun-mountain.jpg|thumb|Eclizee-Burun Mountain]]
The southeast coast is flanked at a distance of {{convert|8|–|12|km|mi|1}} from the sea by a parallel range of mountains, the [[Crimean Mountains]].<ref>The [[Crimean Mountains]] may also be referred to as the Yaylâ Dağ or Alpine Meadow Mountains.</ref> These mountains are backed by [[Cuesta|secondary parallel ranges]].

The main range of these mountains shoots up with extraordinary abruptness from the deep floor of the Black Sea to an altitude of {{convert|600|–|1545|m|ft|0}}, beginning at the southwest point of the [[peninsula]], called [[Cape Fiolente]].  It was believed that this cape was supposedly crowned with the temple of [[Artemis]], where [[Iphigeneia]] is said to have officiated as priestess.<ref>See the article "Crimea" in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]].</ref>
[[Uchan-su (waterfall)|Uchan-su]], on the south slope of the mountains, is the highest waterfall in Crimea.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://extremetime.ru/en/tours/krim_3kaniona.aspx|publisher=extremetime.ru |title=Three canyons trekking (Chernorechensky Canyon, Uzunja Canyon and Grand Crimean Canyon).

===Hydrography===
There are 257 rivers and major streams on the Crimean peninsula which are primarily fed by rainwater, with snowmelt playing a very minor role. This means there is significant annual fluctuation in water flow with many streams drying up completely during the summer.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Jaoshvili, Shalva |year=2002 |title=The rivers of the Black Sea |location=Copenhagen |publisher=European Environment Agency |page=15 |oclc=891861999 |url=http://edz.bib.uni-mannheim.de/daten/edz-bn/eua/02/C__DOKUME~1_ZEFZEI_LOKALE~1_TEMP_plugtmp_tech71_en.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310073738/http://edz.bib.uni-mannheim.de/daten/edz-bn/eua/02/C__DOKUME~1_ZEFZEI_LOKALE~1_TEMP_plugtmp_tech71_en.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2016 |deadurl=no}}</ref> The largest rivers are the [[Salhir River|Salhir]] (Salğır, Салгир), the Kacha (Кача), the [[Alma River (Crimea)|Alma]] (Альма), and the Belbek (Бельбек).

===Steppe===
{{main|Pontic-Caspian steppe}}
Seventy-five percent of the remaining area of Crimea consists of semiarid [[prairie]] lands, a southward continuation of the [[Pontic-Caspian steppe]], which slope gently to the northwest from the foot of the Crimean Mountains.
Numerous [[kurgan]]s, or [[burial mound]]s, of the ancient [[Scythia]]ns are scattered across the Crimean steppes.

===Crimean Riviera===
[[File:Ялта Южный берег ДДима.jpg|thumb|The [[Crimean Mountains]] in the background and [[Yalta]] as seen from the [[Tsar's Path]].]]

The terrain that lies beyond the sheltering Crimean Mountain range is of an altogether different character. Here, the narrow strip of coast and the slopes of the mountains are smothered with greenery. This "riviera" stretches along the southeast coast from capes [[Cape Fiolente|Fiolente]] and [[Cape Aya|Aya]], in the south, to Feodosiya, and is studded with summer sea-bathing resorts such as [[Alupka]], [[Yalta]], [[Gurzuf]], [[Alushta]], [[Sudak]], and [[Feodosiya]]. During the years of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, the resorts and [[dacha]]s of this coast served as the prime perquisites of the politically loyal.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}<sup>why here? and ref?</sup> In addition, vineyards and fruit orchards are located in the region. Fishing, mining, and the production of essential oils are also important. Numerous Crimean Tatar villages, mosques, [[monastery|monasteries]], and palaces of the Russian imperial family and nobles are found here, as well as picturesque ancient Greek and medieval castles.

The Crimean Mountains and the southern coast are part of the [[Crimean Submediterranean forest complex]] ecoregion. The natural vegetation consists of scrublands, woodlands, and forests, with a climate and vegetation similar to the [[Mediterranean Basin]].

===Climate===
[[File:Novyi Svit IMG 2941 1725.jpg|thumb|Crimea's south coast has a subtropical climate]]
Most of Crimea has a temperate continental climate, except for the south coast where it experiences a humid subtropical climate{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, due to warm influences from the Black Sea and the high ground of the Crimean Mountains. Summers can be hot ({{convert|28|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} July average) and winters are cool ({{convert|-0.3|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} January average) in the interior, on the south coast winters are milder ({{convert|4|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} January average) and temperatures much below freezing are exceptional. On the high ground, freezing weather is common in winter. Precipitation throughout Crimea is low, averaging only {{convert|400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} a year. The Crimean coast is shielded from the north winds by the mountains, and as a result usually has mild winters. Cool season temperatures average around {{convert|7|°C|°F|1}} and it is rare for the weather to drop below freezing except in the mountains, where there is usually snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/climate.html |title=Climate in Crimea,Weather in Yalta:How Often Does it Rain in Crimea? |publisher=Blacksea-crimea.com |accessdate=2014-04-10}}</ref> Because of its climate and subsidized travel packages from Russian state-run companies, the southern Crimean coast has remained a popular resort for Russian tourists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/russia-ukraine-update-crimea-attracts-more-4-million-tourists-despite-annexation-2141287|publisher=ibtimes.com |title=Russia-Ukraine Update: Crimea Attracts More Than 4 Million Tourists Despite Annexation| date=14 October 2015| accessdate=1 May 2016}}</ref>

The Black Sea ports of Crimea provide quick access to the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], [[Balkans]] and Middle East. [[History of Crimea|Historically]], possession of the southern coast of Crimea was sought after by most empires of the greater region since antiquity ([[Roman Crimea|Roman]], [[Cherson (theme)|Byzantine]], [[Gedik Ahmed Pasha|Ottoman]], [[Taurida Governorate|Russian]], [[Crimean War|British and French]], [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|Nazi German]], [[Black Sea Fleet#Soviet Navy|Soviet]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10671066/What-is-the-Crimea-and-why-does-it-matter.html |title=What is the Crimea, and why does it matter? |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2014-03-02 |accessdate=2014-04-10}}</ref>

The [[Dnieper River]] is a major waterway and transportation route that crosses the European continent from north to south and ultimately links the Black Sea with the [[Baltic Sea]], of strategic importance since the historical [[trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]].

==Economy==
[[File:Koreiz - beach3.jpg|thumb|Tourism is an important sector of Crimea's economy]]
The main branches of the modern Crimean economy are tourism and agriculture.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Industrial plants are situated for the most part in the northern regions of the republic. Important industrial cities include [[Dzhankoy]], housing a major railway connection, [[Krasnoperekopsk]] and [[Armyansk]], among others. Since the Russian annexation of Crimea in early 2014 and subsequent sanctions targeting Crimea, the tourist industry has suffered major losses. The flow of holidaymakers dropped 35 percent in the first half of 2015 over the same period of 2014.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/tourist-season-washout-in-annexed-crimea/25446604.html "Tourist Season a Washout in Annexed Crimea"]</ref>

The most important industries in Crimea include food production, chemical fields, mechanical engineering and metal working, and fuel production industries.<ref name = "CMU"/> Sixty percent of the industry market belongs to food production. There are a total of 291 large industrial enterprises and 1002 small business enterprises.<ref name = "CMU"/>

Agriculture in the region includes cereals, vegetable-growing, gardening, and [[Ukrainian wine|wine-making]], particularly in the Yalta and [[Massandra]] regions.

{{main|Kerch Strait Bridge}}
In May 2015, work began on a multibillion-dollar road-rail bridge across the Kerch Strait, sometimes referred to as 'Putin's Bridge'. It is projected to be fully completed and operational by 2019.<ref>{{cite news|title=Putin orders military exercise as protesters clash in Crimea|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-crimea-bridge-idUSKCN0XF1YS|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=24 April 2016|publisher=reuters}}</ref>

;Public transportation
Almost every settlement in Crimea is connected with another settlement by bus lines. Crimea contains the longest (96&nbsp;km or 59&nbsp;mi) [[Crimean Trolleybus|trolleybus route]] in the world, stretching from Simferopol to Yalta.<ref name="Crimea">{{cite web|url=http://www.blacksea-crimea.com/Places/trolleybuses.html |title=The longest trolleybus line in the world! |accessdate=January 15, 2007 |work=blacksea-crimea.com }}</ref> The trolleybus line starts near [[Simferopol]]'s Railway Station (at Soviet age start near [[Simferopol International Airport]]) through the mountains to [[Alushta]] and on to Yalta. The length of line is about 90&nbsp;km. It was founded in 1959.

Railroad lines running through Crimea include [[Armyansk]]—Kerch (with a link to Feodosiya), and [[Melitopol]]—Sevastopol (with a link to Yevpatoria), connecting Crimea to the Ukrainian mainland.

The development of Crimea as a holiday destination began in the second half of the 19th century. The development of the transport networks brought masses of tourists from central parts of the [[Russian Empire]].
At the beginning of the 20th century, a major development of palaces, villas, and dachas began—most of which remain. These are some of the main attractions of Crimea as a tourist destination. There are many [[Crimean legends]] about famous touristic places, which attract the attention of tourists.

A new phase of tourist development began when the Soviet government realised the potential of the healing quality of the local air, lakes and therapeutic muds. It became a "health" destination for Soviet workers, and hundreds of thousands of Soviet tourists visited Crimea.

[[Artek (camp)|Artek]] is a  former [[Young Pioneer camp]]  on the [[Black Sea]] in the town of [[Hurzuf]], near [[Ayu-Dag]], established in 1925.   In 1969 it had an area of 3.2&nbsp;km². The camp consisted of 150 buildings Unlike most of the young pioneer camps, Artek was an all-year camp, due to the warm climate. Artek was considered to be a privilege for Soviet children during its existence, as well as for children from other communist countries. During its heyday, 27,000 children a year vacationed at Artek. Between 1925 and 1969 the camp hosted 300,000 children.<ref>[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd ed., [http://slovari.yandex.ru/~книги/БСЭ/Артек/ Entry on Artek]</ref> After the breaking up of the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] in 1991 its prestige declined, though it remained a popular vacation destination.<ref name="tub">[http://ukrainian.su/kryim/artek-mezhdunarodnyiy-detskiy-tsentr.html The International Children Center Artek] - Ukrainian tours</ref>

In the 1990s, Crimea became more of a get-away destination than a "health-improvement" destination. The most visited areas are the south shore of Crimea with cities of Yalta and Alushta, the western shore - Eupatoria and Saki, and the south-eastern shore - Feodosia and Sudak.
According to [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]], Crimea was among the top 20 travel destinations in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/best-trips-2013/|title=Best Trips 2013, Crimea|author=National Geographic Society|work=National Geographic|accessdate=29 March 2015}}</ref>

===Sanctions===
{{main|International sanctions during the Ukrainian crisis}}

Following Russia's unrecognized annexation of Crimea, the [[European Union]], the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and several other countries (including Ukraine) imposed [[economic sanctions]] against Russia, including some specifically targeting Crimea.

Ethnic composition of Crimea's population has changed dramatically since the early 20th century. The 1897 [[Russian Empire Census]] for the [[Taurida Governorate]] reported: 196,854 (13.06%) Crimean Tatars, 404,463 (27.94%) Russians  and  611,121 (42.21%) Ukrainians. But these numbers included Berdyansky, Dneprovsky and Melitopolsky [[uyezds]] which were on mainland, not in Crimea. The population number excluding these uyezds is given in the table below.
