'''CSX Transportation''' {{Reporting mark|CSXT}} is a [[Class I railroad]] in the [[United States]] and the initialism means Chessie and Seaboard System. The main subsidiary of the [[CSX Corporation]], the railroad is headquartered in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and owns about 21,000 route miles (34,000&nbsp;km).<ref>CSX Transportation, Jacksonville, FL. [http://www.csx.com/index.cfm/about-csx/company-overview/ "Company Overview."] Accessed 2012-12-02.</ref> CSX operates one of the three Class I railroads serving most of the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], the other two being the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] (NS) and [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. It also serves the Canadian provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. Together CSX and [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] have a [[duopoly]] over all east-west freight rail traffic east of the Mississippi River. As of October 1, 2014 CSX's total public stock value was slightly over $32&nbsp;billion.

==History==
{{See also|List of CSX Transportation predecessor railroads}}
CSX Transportation was formed on July 1, 1986, by combining the [[Chessie System]] and [[Seaboard System Railroad]]. The originator of the Seaboard System was the former [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]], which previously merged [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]] in 1967, and later [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad|Louisville & Nashville Railroad]], as well as several smaller subsidiaries such as the [[Clinchfield Railroad]], [[Atlanta and West Point Railroad|Atlanta & West Point Railroad]], [[Monon Railroad]] and the [[Georgia Railroad and Banking Company|Georgia Railroad]]. The origin of the [[Chessie System]] was the former [[Chesapeake & Ohio Railway]], which had merged with the [[Baltimore & Ohio Railroad]], and [[Western Maryland Railroad]].

On June 23, 1997, CSX and [[Norfolk Southern Railway]] (NS) filed a joint application with the [[Surface Transportation Board]] for authority to purchase, divide, and operate the assets of the {{convert|11000|mi}} [[Conrail]], which had been created in 1976 by bringing together several ailing Northeastern railway systems into a [[government-owned corporation]]. On June 6, 1998, the STB approved the CSX–NS application and set August 22, 1998, as the effective date of its decision. CSX acquired 42 percent of Conrail's assets, and NS received the remaining 58 percent. As a result of the transaction, CSX's rail operations grew to include some {{convert|3800|mi}} of the Conrail system (predominantly lines that had belonged to the former [[New York Central Railroad]]). CSX began operating its trains on its portion of the Conrail network on June 1, 1999. CSX now serves much of the [[Eastern United States|eastern U.S.]], with a few routes into nearby Canadian cities.
[[File:Csx corp logo.png|thumb|left|200px|The original logo for the [[CSX Corporation]], emphasizing the "multiplication symbol" X]]
The name came about during merger talks between [[Chessie System, Inc.]] and [[Seaboard System Railroad, Inc.]], commonly called ''Chessie'' and ''Seaboard''. The company chairmen said it was important for the new name to include neither of those names because it was a partnership. Employees were asked for suggestions, most of which consisted of combinations of the initials. At the same time a temporary shorthand name was needed for discussions with the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]]. CSC was chosen but belonged to a trucking company in [[Virginia]]. CSM (for Chessie-Seaboard Merger) was also taken. The lawyers decided to use CSX, and the name stuck. In the public announcement, it was said that "CSX is singularly appropriate. C can stand for Chessie, S for Seaboard, and X, which actually has no meaning." But the X could be used as a short term for the word "Express" taking off the "E" giving out "Xpress", putting the X in use. X could also mean a cross between the Chessie System and the Seaboard System. The T had to be added to CSX when used as a [[reporting mark]] because reporting marks that end in X means that the car is owned by a leasing company or private car owner. Its current slogan, "How Tomorrow Moves", appeared in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&id=274| author=Dolinger, Milt| title=How CSX got its name| journal=Trains magazine online| date=2006-05-01 }}</ref>

In 2014 [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] approached CSX with an offer to merge the two companies, but CSX declined and in 2015 Canadian Pacific made an attempt to purchase and merge with [[Norfolk Southern]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-pacific-approached-csx-about-merger-deal-1413141950?KEYWORDS=CSX | work=The Wall Street Journal | first1=Dana | last1=Mattioli | first2=Liz | last2=Hoffman | first3=David | last3=George-Cosh | title=Canadian Pacific Approached CSX About Merger Deal | date=October 13, 2014}}</ref>

==CSX divisions==
CSX operates two regions of five divisions each: the Northern, based in [[Calumet City, Illinois]]; and Southern, based in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].

===Northern Region Divisions===
*Great Lakes Division, based in Indianapolis, Indiana
*Chicago Division, based in Calumet City, Illinois
*Albany Division, based in Selkirk, New York
*Baltimore Division, based in Baltimore, Maryland
*Louisville Division, based in Cincinnati, Ohio

One line in the Northern Region travels into Canada:
* Montreal Subdivision (Albany Division) from [[Massena, New York]], to [[Beauharnois, Quebec]]

===Southern Region Divisions===
*Atlanta Division, based in Atlanta, Georgia
*Huntington Division, based in Huntington, West Virginia
*Nashville Division, based in Nashville, Tennessee
*Florence Division, based in Florence, South Carolina
*Jacksonville Division, based in Jacksonville, Florida (at Dufford Center)

==Unit trains==
[[File:Silver Snake (4252221127).jpg|thumb|250px|A long CSX coal train of empty hoppers crosses the [[New River (Kanawha River)|New River]] as seen from [[Hawk's Nest State Park]]]]
CSX operates the [[Juice Train]] — a collective name for Train Nos. O823, Q740 and Q741, Q743, and Q745 — which consists of [[Tropicana Products|Tropicana]] cars that carry fresh [[orange juice]] between [[Bradenton, Florida]], and the [[Greenville, New Jersey|Greenville]] section of [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. The train also runs from Bradenton to [[Fort Pierce, Florida]], via the [[Florida East Coast Railway]]. In the 21st century, the Juice Train has been studied as a model of efficient rail transportation that can compete with trucks and other modes in the perishable-goods trade.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

[[Coke Express]] trains run between [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Chicago]], and other places in the [[rust belt]], carrying [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] to industries, mainly [[steel mill]]s.

CSX also runs daily trash trains Q702 and Q703 from [[Oak Point Yard|The Bronx]] to Philadelphia (via [[Selkirk Yard]]) and then Petersburg, Virginia, where they interchange with NS. These trains consist of {{convert|89|ft|adj=on}} flatcars loaded with four containers of trash. Another pair of trains, Q710 and Q711, originate in [[Kearny, New Jersey]], and terminate in [[Russell, Kentucky]].

Another style of unit train is a local trash train, D765, that runs between the Maryland towns of [[Derwood, Maryland|Derwood]] and [[Dickerson, Maryland|Dickerson]]. The train runs daily except on Sundays; on holidays it sometimes runs twice a day. Trash is carried from [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]]'s Shady Grove Transfer Station to a [[waste-to-energy]] plant located off the [[Potomac Electric Power Company|PEPCO]] lead to [[Mirant]]'s [[Dickerson Generating Station]]. The trip is roughly {{convert|17|mi|km}}, and the train is made up of National Steel Car Company-built well cars, hauling {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} containers. The first NEMX equipment was built when the D765 first started operations in 1995. In recent years, the fleet has been somewhat upgraded, repainted, and new cars have been constructed. In the early days, the locomotives powering the train were a GP40-2/RDMT slug set, but currently the train can be upwards of 47&nbsp;cars. The locomotives that now routinely power the train are a pair of EMD [[SD50]]s.

Working with [[Union Pacific]], CSX runs an extended-haul perishables train, Q090. Known by the railroad as the "Apple Train" or "Salad Shooter", the train runs from [[Wallula, WA|Wallula, Washington]], to [[Schenectady, New York]]. This train typically runs with three of Union Pacific's newest locomotives and has its extended haul inspection from Wallula to Schenectady at Cleveland-Collinwood Yard on CSX headed in both directions. On the return trip, the train is labeled Q091. CSX modified its Train Handling rule book to allow this train to use more power axles.<ref>{{cite book| title = Air Brake and Train Handling Rules,  | publisher = CSX Transportation| date = October 2007| location = | pages = Section 4, Page 1 | accessdate = 2009-06-13}}</ref> In early 2012 the "Salad Shooter" derailed just a few miles northwest of Greenwich Ohio. No injuries were reported in the incident.{{cn|date=November 2015}}

==Locomotives==
The vast majority of CSX locomotives have flashing ditch lights.

CSX currently uses a blue and yellow livery for its locomotives. More than 1,000 CSX locomotives are painted in the YN3 scheme, which debuted in 2002 on No. 8503, an [[EMD SD50]] that has since been downgraded to an SD50-2.<ref name="trainweb">{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/csxphotos/photos/SD50/8503CSX-yn3.jpg|title=Image: 8503CSX-yn3.jpg, (640 × 480 px)|publisher=trainweb.org|accessdate=2015-09-01}}</ref>

CSX recently created a new paint scheme, known as YN3b or more informally "Cost Cutter", which updates YN3 with the most recent CSX  logo. The first unit to wear this scheme was ES44AH 950. Currently, CSX's ES44AHs 950-999 and 3000–3249 and the ET44AHs 3250-3423 wear the scheme, along with several recently repainted older locomotives, the first of which was SD70MAC 4719, which was repainted at the Huntington Locomotive Shops in September 2012. CSX has also obtained a few [[EMD F40PH]]s that were retired from [[Amtrak]] for executive office car service.

All of the former-Conrail locomotives in active service have been repainted in a CSX livery. Former Conrail locomotives can be spotted by recognizing phase differences in engine models and numbering. Other spotting details can be inconsistent, but can include a number of the following: red marker lights, Leslie model RS3L or RS5T [[Train horn|air horns]]( only a few original horns remain. Many have been replaced by K5LAs. ) former Conrail SD40-2s ride on [[Flexicoil]] "C" trucks and have anticlimbers, ditch lights mounted beneath the anticlimber, headlights above the cab (vs. CSX's standard practice of nose mounted headlights on all wide-nose GE units), and modified "Bright Future" paint with battery box faces painted yellow (instead of black or blue).
