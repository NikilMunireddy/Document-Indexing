'''David Lloyd George, 1st Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor''', {{post-nominals | sep=, | country=GBR | OM | PC}} (17 January 1863  – 26 March 1945) was a British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician and statesman.

As [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (1908–1915), Lloyd George was a key figure in the introduction of many reforms which laid the foundations of the modern [[welfare state]]. His most important role came as the highly energetic Prime Minister of the [[United Kingdom coalition government (1916–1922)|Wartime Coalition]] Government (1916–22), during and immediately after the [[World War I|First World War]]. He was a major player at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919 that reordered Europe after the defeat of Germany in the Great War. So confident was he of this peace, that in August 1934 (following [[Austrofascism|Austria's transition to fascism]]) he insisted Germany could not wage war, and assured European nations that there would be no risk of war during the next ten years.<ref>[https://kranten.archiefalkmaar.nl/issue/ACO/1934-08-09/edition/null/page/6 EERSTE TIEN JAAR GEEN OORLOG. Verklaringen van Lloyd George. (Dutch)], ''Alkmaarsche Courant'', 9 August 1934, p.6</ref> He arguably made a greater impact on British public life than any other 20th-century leader, thanks to his pre-war introduction of Britain's social welfare system, his leadership in winning the war, his post-war role in reshaping Europe, and his [[partition of Ireland|partitioning Ireland]] (between the [[Irish Free State]] and [[Northern Ireland]] which remained part of the UK).<ref name="Martin Pugh 2002">{{Harvnb | Pugh | 2009}}</ref>

He was the last [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] to serve as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Parliamentary support for the coalition premiership was mostly from Conservatives rather than his own Liberals. The Liberal split led to the long-term decline of that party as a serious political force. Although he became leader of the Liberal Party in the late 1920s, he was unable to regain power, and by the 1930s he was a marginalised and widely mistrusted figure.

Although many Prime Ministers have been [[barrister]]s, Lloyd George is to date the only [[solicitor]] to have held that office.<ref name="AJP Taylor 1961">{{Harvnb | Taylor | 1961}}</ref> He is also so far the only British Prime Minister to have been [[Welsh people|Welsh]]<ref>Although, in Parliament, Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]] represented a district in Wales ([[Cardiff]]), Callaghan was English by birth and language.</ref> and to have spoken English as a second language.<ref name="Toby Harnden">{{Harvnb | Harnden | 2011 | p=11}}</ref> He was voted the [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|third greatest]] British prime minister of the 20th century in a poll of 139 academics organised by [[MORI]], and in 2002 he was named among the [[100 Greatest Britons]] following a UK-wide vote.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=661 | title=Rating British Prime Ministers | publisher=Ipsos MORI | date= | accessdate=16 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-134458/100-great-Britons--A-complete-list.html | title=100 great Britons – A complete list | publisher=Daily Mail | date=21 August 2002 }}</ref>

==Upbringing and early life==
Lloyd George was born in [[Chorlton-on-Medlock]], near [[Manchester]], to [[Welsh people|Welsh]] parents. He was brought up as a [[Welsh language|Welsh]]-speaker and was to become the first (and so far only) Welsh politician to hold the office of Prime Minister. His father, William George, had been a teacher in both London and Liverpool And had lived on Bannerman Road. He also taught in the Hope Street Sunday Schools, which were administered by the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches|Unitarian]]s, where he met Unitarian minister [[James Martineau|Dr James Martineau]].<ref>{{Harvnb | Crosby | 2014 | p=1}}</ref> In March of the same year, on account of his failing health, William George returned with his family to his native [[Pembrokeshire]]. He took up farming but died in June 1864 of [[pneumonia]], aged 44. His widow, Elizabeth George (1828–96), sold the farm and moved with her children to her native [[Llanystumdwy]] in [[Caernarfonshire]], where she lived in [[Tŷ Newydd]] with her brother Richard Lloyd (1834–1917), who was a shoemaker, a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] (in the [[Baptist Union of Scotland|Scotch Baptists]] and then the [[Restoration Movement#Great Britain|Church of Christ]]),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://churches-of-christ.ws/Criccieth.htm | title=Criccieth church of Christ, Wales and David Lloyd George | website=churches of christ | access-date=2016-02-09 }}</ref> and a strong Liberal. Lloyd George was educated at the local [[Anglican]] school Llanystumdwy National School and later under tutors. Lloyd George's uncle was a towering influence on him, encouraging him to take up a career in law and enter politics; his uncle remained influential up until his death at age 83 in February 1917, by which time his nephew had become Prime Minister. He added his uncle's surname to become "Lloyd George". His surname is usually given as "Lloyd George" and sometimes as "George". The influence of his childhood showed through in his entire career, as he attempted to aid the common man at the expense of what he liked to call "the Dukes" (that is, the aristocracy). However, his biographer [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] argued that Lloyd George's childhood was nowhere near as poverty-stricken as he liked to suggest, and that a great deal of his self-confidence came from having been brought up by an uncle who enjoyed a position of influence and prestige in his small community.

Brought up a devout evangelical, as a young man he suddenly lost his religious faith. Biographer Don Cregier says he became "a Deist and perhaps an agnostic, though he remained a chapel-goer and connoisseur of good preaching all his life."<ref name="Creiger 1976">{{Harvnb | Creiger | 1976 | p=13}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb | Crosby | 2014 | p=6}}</ref> He kept quiet about that, however, and was hailed as "one of the foremost fighting leaders of a fanatical Welsh [[Nonconformism|Nonconformity]]".<ref>{{Harvnb | Owen | 1955 | pp=7, 31}}</ref>

It was also during this period of his life that Lloyd George first became interested in the issue of land ownership. As a young man he read books by [[Thomas Spence]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Henry George]], as well as pamphlets written by [[George Bernard Shaw]] and [[Sidney Webb]] of the [[Fabian Society]] on the issue of land ownership.<ref>{{Harvnb | Crosby | 2014 | p=425}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb | Gilbert | 1992 | p=55}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Simkin | first=John | year= 2015 | url=http://spartacus-educational.com/PRgeorge.htm | title=David Lloyd George | website=spartacus-educational.com | access-date=2016-02-10}}</ref> By the age of twenty-one, he had already read and taken notes on [[Henry George]]'s ''[[Progress and Poverty]]''. This strongly influenced Lloyd George's politics later in life through the [[People's Budget]] which heavily drew on the [[georgist]] tax reform ideas.

[[File:David Lloyd George NLW3362532 cropped.jpg | thumb|right | Lloyd George in about 1890]]
[[Articled clerk|Articled]] to a firm of [[solicitor]]s in [[Porthmadog]], Lloyd George was admitted in 1884 after taking Honours in his final law examination and set up his own practice in the back parlour of his uncle's house in 1885. The practice flourished, and he established branch offices in surrounding towns, taking his brother William into partnership in 1887. By then he was politically active, having campaigned for the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 election]], attracted by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s "unauthorised programme" of reforms. The election resulted firstly in a stalemate with neither the Liberals nor the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] having a majority, the balance of power being held by the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]]. [[William Gladstone]]'s announcement of a determination to bring about Irish [[Home Rule]] later led to Chamberlain leaving the Liberals to form the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]]. Uncertain of which wing to follow, Lloyd George carried a pro-Chamberlain resolution at the local Liberal Club and travelled to [[Birmingham]] to attend the first meeting of Chamberlain's National Radical Union, but he had his dates wrong and arrived a week too early. In 1907, he was to say that he thought Chamberlain's plan for a federal solution correct in 1886 and still thought so, that he preferred the unauthorised programme to the [[British Whig Party|Whig]]-like platform of the official Liberal Party, and that, had Chamberlain proposed solutions to Welsh grievances such as [[land reform]] and [[disestablishment]], he, together with most Welsh Liberals, would have followed Chamberlain.

On 24 January 1888 he married [[Margaret Lloyd George|Margaret Owen]], the daughter of a well-to-do local farming family. Also in that year he and other young Welsh Liberals founded a monthly paper ''Udgorn Rhyddid'' (Bugle of Freedom) and won on [[appeal]] to the Divisional Court of Queen's Bench the Llanfrothen burial case; this established the right of [[Nonconformist]]s to be buried according to their own denominational rites in parish burial grounds, a right given by the [[Burial Laws Amendment Act 1880]] that had up to then been ignored by the Anglican clergy. It was this case, which was hailed as a great victory throughout Wales, and his writings in ''Udgorn Rhyddid'' that led to his adoption as the Liberal candidate for [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Carnarvon Boroughs]] on 27 December 1888.

In 1889 he became an [[Alderman]] on the [[Carnarvonshire]] [[County Council]] which had been created by the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. At that time he appeared to be trying to create a separate Welsh [[Welsh nationalism|national party]] modelled on [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnell]]'s [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] and worked towards a union of the North and South Wales Liberal Federations. For the same county Lloyd George would also become a [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (1910)<ref name="kellys">{{harvnb | Kelly's | 1945 | p=1185}}</ref> and chairman of [[Quarter Sessions]] (1929–38),<ref name=bpeerage>{{harvnb | Burke's | 1949 | p=1241}}</ref> and [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] in 1921.<ref name=kellys />

==Member of Parliament==
[[File:1895 David Lloyd George sepia.jpg | thumb|left | Lloyd George in 1895]]
Lloyd George was returned as Liberal MP for [[Caernarfon (UK Parliament constituency)|Carnarvon Boroughs]] – by a margin of 19 votes – on 13 April 1890 at a [[by-election]] caused by the death of the former [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] member. He sat with an informal grouping of Welsh Liberal members with a programme of disestablishing and disendowing the [[Church of England]] in Wales, [[temperance movement in Wales|temperance]] reform, and [[Welsh home rule]]. He would remain an MP until 1945, 55 years later.

As backbench members of the House of Commons were not paid at that time, he supported himself and his growing family by continuing to practise as a [[solicitor]], opening an office in [[London]] under the name of ''Lloyd George and Co.'' and continuing in partnership with William George in [[Criccieth]]. In 1897 he merged his growing London practice with that of Arthur Rhys Roberts (who was to become [[Official Solicitor]]) under the name of ''Lloyd George, Roberts and Co.''.

He was soon speaking on Liberal issues (particularly temperance – the "[[local option]]", and national as opposed to denominational education) throughout England as well as Wales. During the next decade, Lloyd George campaigned in Parliament largely on Welsh issues and in particular for disestablishment and disendowment of the Church of England.  He wrote extensively for Liberal papers such as the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]''. When [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] retired in 1894 after the defeat of the [[second Home Rule Bill]], the Welsh Liberal members chose him to serve on a deputation to [[William Vernon Harcourt (politician)|William Harcourt]] to press for specific assurances on Welsh issues; when those were not provided, they resolved to take independent action if the government did not bring a bill for disestablishment. When that was not forthcoming, he and three other Welsh Liberals ([[David Alfred Thomas]], [[Herbert Lewis]] and [[Frank Edwards (British politician)|Frank Edwards]]) refused the [[whip (politics)|whip]] on 14 April 1894 but accepted [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]]'s assurance and rejoined the official Liberals on 29 May. Thereafter, he devoted much time to setting up branches of [[Cymru Fydd]] (Young Wales), which, he said, would in time become a force like the [[Irish National Party]]. He abandoned this idea after being criticised in Welsh newspapers for bringing about the defeat of the Liberal Party in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 election]] and when, at a meeting in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] on 16 January 1896, the South Wales Liberal Federation, led by [[David Alfred Thomas]] and [[Robert Bird (Welsh politician)|Robert Bird]] moved that he be not heard.

Lloyd George had been impressed by his journey to Canada in 1899.  Although sometimes wrongly supposed – both at the time and subsequently – to be a [[Little Englander]], he was not an opponent of the British Empire ''per se'', but in a speech at [[Birkenhead]] (21 November 1901) stressed that it needed to be based on freedom – including for India – not "racial arrogance".<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002d | p=61}}</ref>  Consequently, he gained national fame by displaying vehement opposition to the [[Second Boer War]].  Following Rosebery's leading antipathy, he based his attack firstly on what were supposed to be war aims – remedying the grievances of the [[Uitlander]]s and in particular the claim that they were wrongly denied the right to vote, saying "I do not believe the war has any connection with the franchise. It is a question of 45% dividends" and that England (which did not then have universal male suffrage) was more in need of franchise reform than the Boer republics.  A second attack came on the cost of the war, which, he argued, prevented overdue social reform in England, such as old age pensions and workmen's cottages.  As the fighting continued, his attacks moved to its conduct by the generals, who, he said (basing his words on reports by [[William Burdett-Coutts]] in ''[[The Times]]''), were not providing for the sick or wounded soldiers and were starving Boer women and children in concentration camps.  But his major thrusts were reserved for the Chamberlains, accusing them of [[war profiteering]] through the family company [[Kynoch]] Ltd, of which Chamberlain's brother was Chairman.  The firm had won tenders to the War Office though its prices were higher than some of its competitors.  After speaking at a meeting in Birmingham, Lloyd George had to be smuggled out disguised as a policeman, as his life was in danger from the mob.  At this time the Liberal Party was badly split as [[H. H. Asquith]], [[Richard Haldane, 1st Viscount Haldane|R. B. Haldane]] and others were supporters of the war and formed the [[Liberal Imperial League]].  On the day Edward VII was signing the ''[[Entente Cordiale]]'', Lloyd George was visiting Rosebery at [[Dalmeny House]].  Rosebery warned him that it would ''increase'' the likelihood of a war with Germany.  Lloyd George tried in vain to persuade the wealthy peer to become Liberal leader again: an important friendship developed that was the genesis of the [[Social liberalism|New Liberalism]]; frequent visits to Dalmeny could not convince him though that the vaunted leadership popularity of the great orator was in touch with real trends.<ref>{{harvnb | Gilbert | 1987 | pp=463–465}}</ref>

[[File:David Lloyd George 1902.jpg | thumb|upright | David Lloyd George in 1902]]

His attacks on the government's [[Education Act 1902]], which provided that county councils would fund [[Faith school|church schools]], helped reunite the Liberals. His successful amendment that the county need only fund those schools where the buildings were in good repair served to make the Act a dead letter in Wales, where the counties were able to show that most Church of England schools were in poor repair. Having already gained national recognition for his anti-Boer War campaigns, his leadership of the attacks on the Education Act gave him a strong parliamentary reputation and marked him as a likely future cabinet member.

==President of the Board of Trade (1905–1908)==
[[File:ChurchillGeorge0001.jpg | thumb | left | David Lloyd George and [[Winston Churchill]] in 1907]]
In 1906, Lloyd George entered the new Liberal Cabinet of [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman|Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] as [[President of the Board of Trade]]. In that position he introduced legislation on many topics, from [[Merchant Shipping Act 1906|merchant shipping]] and the [[Port of London Act 1908|Port of London]] to [[Companies Act 1907|companies]] and railway regulation,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} but his main achievement was in stopping a proposed national strike of the railway unions by brokering an agreement between the unions and the railway companies. While almost all the companies refused to recognise the unions, Lloyd George persuaded the companies to recognise elected representatives of the workers who sat with the company representatives on conciliation boards—one for each company. If those boards failed to agree then there was a central board. This was Lloyd George's first great triumph, for which he received praises from, among others, [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]]. Two weeks later, however, his great excitement was crushed by his daughter Mair's death from [[appendicitis]].

==Chancellor of the Exchequer (1908–1915)==

On Campbell-Bannerman's death he succeeded Asquith, who had become Prime Minister, as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] from 1908 to 1915. While he continued some work from the Board of Trade—for example, legislation to establish the [[Port of London Authority]] and to pursue traditional Liberal programmes such as licensing law reforms—his first major trial in this role was over the 1908–1909 Naval Estimates. The Liberal manifesto at the [[UK general election, 1906|1906 general elections]] included a commitment to reduce military expenditure. Lloyd George strongly supported this, writing to [[Reginald McKenna]], [[Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty|First Lord of the Admiralty]], "the emphatic pledges given by all of us at the last general election to reduce the gigantic expenditure on armaments built up by the recklessness of our predecessors."

He then proposed the programme be reduced from six to four [[dreadnoughts]]. This was adopted by the government, but there was a public storm when the Conservatives, with covert support from the [[First Sea Lord]], Admiral [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Jackie Fisher]], campaigned for more with the slogan "We want eight and we won't wait". This resulted in Lloyd George's defeat in Cabinet and the adoption of estimates including provision for eight dreadnoughts.

===People's Budget, 1909===
[[File:David Lloyd George 1911.jpg | thumb | left | upright | Portrait of Chancellor Lloyd George by [[Christopher Williams (Welsh artist)|Christopher Williams]] (1911)]]

In 1909 Lloyd George introduced his [[People's Budget]] imposing a 20% tax on the unearned increase in value of [[land value tax|land]], payable at death of the owner or sale of the land, and ½ d. on undeveloped land and minerals, increased death duties, a rise in income tax, and the introduction of a 'super tax' on income over £3,000.<ref>{{harvnb | McKinstry | 2005 | pp=504–505}}</ref>  There were taxes also on luxuries, alcohol, and tobacco, so that money could be made available for the new welfare programmes as well as new battleships.  The nation's landowners (well represented in the House of Lords) were intensely angry at the new taxes, mostly at the proposed very high tax on [[land value tax|land values]], but also because the instrumental redistribution of wealth could be used to detract from an argument for protective tariffs.<ref>{{harvnb | Ramsden | 1998}}</ref> The immediate consequences included the end of the [[Liberal League (United Kingdom)|Liberal League]], and Rosebery breaking friendship with the Liberal Party, which in itself was for Lloyd George, a triumph. He had won the case of social reform without losing the debate on Free Trade.<ref>{{harvnb | Jenkins | 1999 | p=166}}</ref> [[Arthur Balfour]] denounced the budget as <blockquote>"vindictive, inequitable, based on no principles, and injurious to the productive capacity of the country."<ref>{{harvnb | Jenkins | 1999 | p=167}}</ref></blockquote> [[Roy Jenkins]] described it as the most significant since Gladstone's in 1860.<ref>{{harvnb | Jenkins | 1999 | p=172}}</ref>

In the House of Commons Lloyd George gave a brilliant account of the budget, which was attacked by the Conservatives. On the stump, notably at his Limehouse speech in 1909, he denounced the Conservatives and the wealthy classes with all his very considerable oratorical power. The budget passed the Commons, but was defeated by the Conservative majority in the House of Lords.  The elections of 1910 upheld the Liberal government and the budget finally passed the Lords.  Subsequently the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which Lloyd George strongly supported, was passed and the veto power of the House of Lords was greatly curtailed.

Although old-age pensions had already been introduced by Asquith as Chancellor, Lloyd George was largely responsible for the introduction of state financial support for the sick and infirm (known colloquially as "going on the Lloyd George" for decades afterwards)—legislation referred to as the [[Liberal Reforms]]. Lloyd George also succeeded in putting through Parliament his [[National Insurance Act 1911]], making provision for sickness and invalidism, and a system of unemployment insurance.  He was helped in his endeavours by forty or so backbenchers who regularly pushed for new social measures, often voted with Labour MPs.<ref>{{harvnb | Watts | 2002}}</ref> These social reforms began in Britain the beginnings of a welfare state and fulfilled the aim of dampening down the demands of the growing working class for rather more radical solutions to their impoverishment.<ref>{{harvnb | Gilbert | 1976}}</ref>

[[File:David Lloyd George c1911.jpg | thumb|right | David Lloyd George circa 1911]]

===Mansion House Speech, 1911===
Lloyd George was considered an opponent of war until the [[Second Moroccan Crisis|Agadir Crisis]] of 1911. His Mansion House speech on 21 July 1911 combined rousing oratory with intoxicating patriotism. Grey was aghast and felt that the Chancellor was more qualified to be Foreign Secretary that he was; German opinion recognised that Britain would resist further German aggression.<ref>{{harvnb | Grey | 1925 | loc=i, pp. 224-225}}</ref> Haldane and Lloyd George were among the minority in the Cabinet who were Pro-German, on grounds of a shared religion, philosophy, artistic culture and scientific enquiry. Germany blamed Lloyd George for doing "untold harm both with regard to German public opinion and the negotiations...namely, to the despatch of [[SMS Panther|the German warship]] to Agadir," and citing Count Metternich "...Mr Lloyd George's speech came upon us like a thunderbolt"<ref>{{harvnb | Grey | 1925 | loc=i, pp. 236-237}}</ref>

===Marconi scandal 1913===
In 1913 Lloyd George, along with [[Rufus Isaacs, 1st Marquess of Reading|Rufus Isaacs]], the Attorney General, was involved in the [[Marconi scandal]]. Accused of speculating in Marconi shares on the inside information that they were about to be awarded a key government contract (which would have caused them to increase in value), he told the House of Commons that he had not speculated in the shares of "that company", which was not the whole truth as he had in fact speculated in shares of Marconi's American sister company. This scandal, which would have destroyed his career if the whole truth had come out at the time, was a precursor to the whiff of corruption (e.g. the sale of honours) that later surrounded Lloyd George's premiership.

===Welsh Church Act 1914===
The [[Church of England]] no longer had majority adherence in most parts of Wales in preference to Wales-led [[Protestantism]], in particular [[Methodism]]. Lloyd George was instrumental in introducing the [[Welsh Church Act 1914|Welsh Church Act]] which [[disestablished]] the [[Anglican Church]] in Wales (though, upon the outbreak of war, the actual [[coming into force]] of the Act was postponed by the [[Suspensory Act 1914]] until 1920), removing the opportunity of the six Welsh Bishops in the new [[Church in Wales]] to apply ''[[ex officio]]'' to sit in the [[House of Lords]] and removing (disendowing) certain pre-1662 property rights.

===First World War===
Lloyd George, seen as an opponent of war until the Agadir Crisis of 1911, supported the entry of the British Empire into the [[World War I|First World War]], not least as [[Belgium]], for whose defence Britain was supposedly fighting, was a "small nation", like Wales or indeed the Boers.<ref name="Gilbert 1992">{{harvnb | Gilbert | 1992}}</ref>

Lloyd George remained in office as Chancellor of the Exchequer for the first year of the Great War. The budget of 17 November 1914 had to allow for lower taxation receipts because of the reduction in world trade. The [[Crimean War|Crimean]] and [[Second Boer War|Boer]] Wars had largely been paid for out of taxation; but Lloyd George raised [[United Kingdom national debt|debt financing]] of £321 m. Huge increases in Super Tax and income tax rates were not followed by sales and purchase tax revenue rises.  While raising £63 m more, the budget was distinguished by the crude attempt to eradicate drinking during wartime, known as the King's Pledge.<ref>{{harvnb | Jenkins | 1999 | p=175}}</ref>

==Minister of Munitions==
[[File:David Lloyd George 1915.jpg | thumb|left | David Lloyd George in 1915]]
{{see also | Minister of Munitions | Shell Crisis of 1915}}
Lloyd George gained a heroic reputation with his energetic work as Minister of Munitions, 1915–16, setting the stage for his move up to the height of power.  After a long struggle with the War Office, he wrested responsibility for arms production away from the generals, making it a purely industrial department, with considerable expert assistance from [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]].<ref name="Adams 1975 232–244">{{harvnb | Adams | 1975 | pp=232–244}}</ref> The two men gained the respect of Liberal cabinet colleagues for improving administrative capabilities, and increasing outputs.<ref>{{harvnb | Grey | 1925 | loc=ii, pp. 242-244}}</ref>

When the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] dismayed public opinion with the news that the Army was running short of artillery shells, demands rose for a strong leader to take charge of munitions. In the [[Second Asquith ministry|first coalition ministry]], formed in May 1915, Lloyd George was made [[Minister of Munitions]], heading a new department.<ref>{{harvnb | Fraser | 1982 | pp=77–94}}</ref>  In this position he won great acclaim, which formed the basis for his political ascent.  All historians agree that he boosted national morale and focused attention on the urgent need for greater output, but many also say the increase in munitions output in 1915-16 was due largely to reforms already underway, though not yet effective, before he had even arrived.  The Ministry broke through the cumbersome bureaucracy of the War Office, resolved labour problems, rationalised the supply system and dramatically increased production.  Within a year it became the largest buyer, seller, and employer in Britain.<ref name="Adams 1975 232–244"/>

Lloyd George was not at all satisfied with the progress of the war.  He wanted to "knock away the props", by attacking Germany's allies – from early in 1915 he argued for the sending of British troops to the Balkans to assist Serbia and bring Greece and other Balkan countries onto the side of the Allies (this was eventually done – the [[Macedonian front|Salonika expedition]] – although not on the scale that Lloyd George had wanted, and mountain ranges made his suggestions of grand Balkan offensives impractical); in 1916 he wanted to send machine guns to [[Romania during World War I|Romania]] (insufficient were available for this to be feasible). These suggestions began a period of poor relations with the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|General Robertson]], who was "brusque to the point of rudeness" and "barely concealed his contempt for Lloyd George's military opinions", to which he was in the habit of retorting "I've 'eard different".<ref>{{harvnb | Corrigan | 2003 | p=316}}</ref>

Lloyd George persuaded [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], the [[Secretary of State for War]], to raise a [[38th (Welsh) Infantry Division|Welsh Division]], but not to recognise nonconformist chaplains in the Army.<ref>{{harvnb | Corrigan | 2003 | pp=309–311}}</ref>

Late in 1915 Lloyd George became a strong supporter of general conscription, an issue that divided principled Liberals, but helped the passage of several [[Military Service Act 1916|conscription acts]] from January 1916 onwards.  In spring 1916 [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Milner]] hoped Lloyd George could be persuaded to bring down the coalition government by resigning, but this did not happen.<ref>{{harvnb | Jeffery | 2006 | p=176}}</ref>

==Secretary of State for War==
[[File:PMLloydGeorge--nsillustratedwar03londuoft.jpg | thumb|Lloyd George in 1916]]

In June 1916 Lloyd George succeeded [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] (whose ship was sunk by a mine while on his way to Russia) as [[Secretary of State for War]], although he had little control over strategy, as General Robertson had been given direct right of access to the Cabinet so as to bypass Kitchener.  However, he did succeed in securing the appointment of Sir [[Eric Geddes]] to take charge of military railways behind British lines in France, with the honorary rank of major-general.<ref>{{harvnb | Corrigan | 2003 | p=317}}</ref> 
Lloyd George told a journalist, [[Roy W. Howard]], in late September that "the fight must be to a finish – to a knockout", a rejection of President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s offer to mediate.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=37–38}}</ref>

Lloyd George was increasingly frustrated at the limited gains of the [[Battle of the Somme (1916)|Somme Offensive]], criticising [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|General Haig]] to [[Ferdinand Foch]] on a visit to the Western Front in September (British casualty ratios were worse than those of the French, who were more experienced and had more artillery), proposing sending Robertson on a mission to Russia (he refused to go), and demanding that more troops be sent to Salonika to help Romania.  Robertson eventually threatened to resign.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=62–63}}</ref>

Much of the press still argued that the professional leadership of Haig and Robertson was preferable to civilian interference which had led to disasters like [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and [[Siege of Kut|Kut]].  [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]], owner of ''[[The Times]]'' stormed into Lloyd George's office and, finding him unavailable, told his secretary "You can tell him that I hear he has been interfering with Strategy, and that if he goes on I will break him", and the same day (11 October) Lloyd George also received a warning letter from [[Howell Arthur Gwynne|H. A. Gwynne]], editor of the ''[[Morning Post]]''. He was obliged to give his "word of honour" to Asquith that he had complete confidence in Haig and Robertson and thought them irreplaceable, but he wrote to Robertson wanting to know how their differences had been leaked to the press (affecting to believe that Robertson had not personally "authorised such a breach of confidence & discipline"). He asserted his right to express his opinions about strategy in November, by which time ministers had taken to holding meetings to which Robertson was not invited.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=64–65, 71–72}}</ref>

The weakness of Asquith as a planner and organiser was increasingly apparent to senior officials. After Asquith had refused to agree to Lloyd George's demand that he should be allowed to chair a small committee to manage the war, he resigned in December 1916. Grey was among leading Asquithians who had identified the Welsh Wizard's intentions the previous month.<ref>{{harvnb | Grey | 1925 | loc=ii, p. 248}}</ref> Lloyd George himself became Prime Minister, with the nation demanding he take vigorous charge of the war.  A ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon of the time showed him as "The New Conductor" conducting the orchestra in the "Opening of the 1917 Overture".<ref name="Gilbert 1992"/>

Although during the political crisis Robertson had advised Lloyd George to "stick to it" and form a small War Council, Lloyd George had planned if necessary to appeal to the country, his Military Secretary Colonel [[Arthur Lee, 1st Viscount Lee of Fareham|Arthur Lee]] having prepared a memo blaming Robertson and the General Staff for the loss of Serbia and Romania.  Lloyd George was restricted by his promise to the Unionists to keep Haig as Commander-in-Chief and the press support for the generals, although [[Alfred Milner|Milner]] and [[George Nathaniel Curzon|Curzon]] were also sympathetic to campaigns to increase British power in the Middle East.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=79–83}}</ref> After Germany's offer (12 December 1916) of a negotiated peace, Lloyd George rebuffed President Wilson's request for the belligerents to state their war aims by demanding terms tantamount to German defeat.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | p=79}}</ref>

==Prime Minister (1916–1922)==
{{See also | Lloyd George Ministry}}

===War leader (1916–1918)===

====Forming a Government====
The fall of Asquith as Prime Minister split the Liberal Party into two factions: those who supported him and those who supported the coalition government. In his ''War Memoirs'', Lloyd George compared himself with Asquith:<ref>{{harvnb | Lloyd George | 1933 | p=602}}</ref>
<blockquote>There are certain indispensable qualities essential to the Chief Minister of the Crown in a great war. . . . Such a minister must have courage, composure, and judgment. All this Mr. Asquith possessed in a superlative degree. . . . But a war minister must also have vision, imagination and initiative—he must show untiring assiduity, must exercise constant oversight and supervision of every sphere of war activity, must possess driving force to energize this activity, must be in continuous consultation with experts, official and unofficial, as to the best means of utilising the resources of the country in conjunction with the Allies for the achievement of victory. If to this can be added a flair for conducting a great fight, then you have an ideal War Minister.</blockquote>

After December 1916, Lloyd George relied on the support of Conservatives and of the press baron [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]] (who owned both ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Daily Mail]]''). Besides the Prime Minister, the five-member [[War Cabinet]] contained three Conservatives (Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Lords [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons [[Bonar Law|Andrew Bonar Law]], and Minister without Portfolio [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]]) and [[Arthur Henderson]], unofficially representing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].

Lloyd George wanted to make the destruction of [[Ottoman Empire]] a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of [[Jerusalem]], to impress British public opinion.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=119–120}}</ref>

At the Rome Conference (5–6 January 1917) Lloyd George was discreetly quiet about plans to take Jerusalem, an object which advanced British interests rather than doing much to win the war. Lloyd George proposed sending heavy guns to Italy with a view to defeating Austria-Hungary, possibly to be balanced by a transfer of Italian troops to Salonika, but was unable to obtain the support of the French or Italians, and Robertson talked of resigning.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=83–85}}</ref>

====Nivelle Affair====
Lloyd George engaged almost constantly in intrigues calculated to reduce the power of the generals, including trying to subordinate British forces in France to the French [[Robert Nivelle|General Nivelle]].  He backed Nivelle because he thought he had 'proved himself to be a Man' by his successful counterattacks at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and because of his promises that he could break the German lines in 48 hours.  Nivelle increasingly complained of Haig's dragging his feet rather than co-operating with their plans for the offensive.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=88–90}}</ref>

The plan was to put British forces under Nivelle's direct command for the great 1917 offensive. The British would attack first, thereby tying down the German reserves. Then the French would strike and score an overwhelming victory in two days. It was announced at a War Cabinet meeting on 24 February, to which neither Robertson nor [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] (Secretary of State for War) had been invited.  Ministers felt that the French generals and staff had shown themselves more skilful than the British in 1916, whilst politically Britain had to give wholehearted support to what would probably be the last major French effort of the war. The Nivelle proposal was then given to Robertson and Haig without warning on 26–27 February. Robertson in particular protested vehemently. Finally a compromise was reached whereby Haig would be under Nivelle's orders but would retain operational control of British forces and keep a right of appeal to London "if he saw good reason". Minutes from the War Cabinet meeting were not sent to [[George V|the King]] until 28 February, so that he did not have a prior chance to object to the plan. After further argument the ''status quo'', that Haig was an ally of the French but was expected to defer to their wishes, was largely restored in mid-March.<ref>{{harvnb | Corrigan | 2003 | pp=322–323}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb | Rowland | 1976 | p=391}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=90–93}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb | Hattersley | 2010 | pp=426–433}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=35–44, 81–98}}</ref>

In the event the British attack at the [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] (9–14 April 1917) was partly successful but with much higher casualties than the Germans suffered. There had been many delays and the Germans, suspecting an attack, had shortened their lines to the strong [[Hindenburg Line]]. The [[Nivelle Offensive|French attack on the Aisne River in mid-April]] gained some tactically important high ground but failed to achieve the promised decisive breakthrough, pushing the French Army to the point of [[French Army Mutinies|mutiny]]. While Haig gained prestige, Lloyd George lost credibility, and the affair further poisoned relations between himself and the "Brasshats".<ref>{{harvnb | Taylor | 1965 | pp=80–81, 86}}</ref>

====The U-Boat War====

=====Shipping=====
In early 1917 the Germans had resumed [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] in a bid to achieve victory on the [[Western Approaches]]. Lloyd George set up a Ministry of Shipping under [[Joseph Paton Maclay, 1st Baron Maclay|Sir Joseph Maclay]], a Glasgow shipowner who was not, until after he left office, a member of either House of Parliament, and housed in a wooden building in a specially drained lake in [[St. James's Park]], within a few minutes' walk from the [[Admiralty]]. The Junior Minister and House of Commons spokesman was the self-advertising [[Leo Chiozza Money]], with whom Maclay did not get on, but on whose appointment Lloyd George insisted, feeling that their qualities would complement one another. The Civil Service staff was headed by the highly able [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]] (then only thirty-four years old) and included [[Arthur Salter, 1st Baron Salter|Arthur Salter]]. A number of shipping magnates were persuaded, like Maclay himself, to work unpaid for the ministry (as had a number of industrialists for the Ministry of Munitions), who were also able to obtain ideas privately from junior naval officers who were reluctant to argue with their superiors in meetings. The ministers heading the Board of Trade, for Munitions ([[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Addison]]) and for Agriculture and Food ([[David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda|Lord Rhondda]]), were also expected to co-operate with Maclay.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=45–47, 49}}</ref>

In accordance with a pledge Lloyd George gave in December 1916, nearly 90% of Britain's merchant shipping tonnage was soon brought under state control (previously less than half had been controlled by the Admiralty), whilst remaining privately owned (similar measures were in force at the time for the railways). Merchant shipping was concentrated, largely on Chiozza Money's initiative, on the transatlantic route where it could more easily be protected, instead of being spread out all over the globe (this relied on imports coming first into North America). Maclay began the process of increasing ship construction, although he was hampered by shortages of steel and labour, and ships under construction in the United States were confiscated by the Americans when she entered the war. In May 1917 [[Eric Campbell Geddes|Eric Geddes]], based at the Admiralty, was put in charge of shipbuilding, and in July he became [[First Lord of the Admiralty]].<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=47–49}}</ref>
Later the German U-Boats were defeated in 1918.

=====Convoys=====
''Main article:'' [[Convoys in World War I]]

Lloyd George had raised the matter of convoys at the War Committee in November 1916, only to be told by the admirals present, including [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Jellicoe]], that convoys presented too large a target, and that merchant ship masters lacked the discipline to "keep station" in a convoy.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | p=49}}</ref>

In February 1917 [[Maurice Hankey]], the secretary of the War Cabinet, wrote a memorandum for Lloyd George calling for the introduction of "scientifically organised convoys", almost certainly after being persuaded by Commander [[Reginald Henderson|Henderson]] and the Shipping Ministry officials with whom he was in contact. After a breakfast meeting (13 February 1917) with Lloyd George, [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] (First Lord of the Admiralty) and Admirals Jellicoe and [[Alexander Ludovic Duff|Duff]] agreed to "conduct experiments". However, convoys were not in general use until August, by which time the rate of shipping losses was already in decline after peaking in April.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=51, 53}}</ref>

Lloyd George later claimed in his memoirs that the delay in introducing convoys was because the Admiralty mishandled an experimental convoy between Britain and Norway, and because Jellicoe obtained, behind Maclay's back, an unrepresentative sample of merchant skippers claiming that they lacked the skill to "keep station" in convoy. In fact Hankey's diary shows that Lloyd George's interest in the matter was intermittent, whilst Frances Stevenson's diaries contain no mention of the topic. He may well have been reluctant, especially at a time when his relations with the generals were so poor, for a showdown with Carson, a weak administrator who was as much the mouthpiece of the admirals as [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Derby]] was of the generals, but who had played a key role in the fall of Asquith and who led a significant bloc of Conservative and Irish Unionist MPs.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=50, 52}}</ref>

The new Commander of the [[Grand Fleet]] Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Beatty]], whom Lloyd George visited at Invergordon on 15 April, was a supporter of convoys, as was the American Admiral [[William Sims|Sims]] (the USA had just entered the war). The War Cabinet (25 April) authorised Lloyd George to look into the anti-submarine campaign, and on 30 April he visited the Admiralty. Duff had already recommended to Jellicoe that the Admiralty adopt convoys after a recent successful convoy from Gibraltar.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=52–53}}</ref>

Most of the organisations Lloyd George created during the First World War were replicated with the outbreak of the Second World War. As [[Lord Beaverbrook]] remarked, "There were no signposts to guide Lloyd George."  The latter's ''personal'' efforts to promote convoys were less consistent than he (and Churchill in ''The World Crisis'' and [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Beaverbrook]] in ''Men and Power'') later claimed; the idea that he, after a hard struggle, sat in the First Lord's chair (on his 30 April visit to the Admiralty) and imposed convoys on a hostile Board is a myth. However, in Grigg's view the credit goes largely to men and institutions which he set in place, and with a freer hand, and making fewer mistakes, than in his dealings with the generals, he and his appointees took decisions which can reasonably be said to have saved the country. "It was a close-run thing … failure would have been catastrophic."<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=45, 49, 52–53}}</ref>

====Russian Revolution====
Lloyd George welcomed the [[February Revolution|Fall of the Tsar]], both in a private letter to his brother and in a message to the new Russian Prime Minister, [[Georgy Lvov|Prince Lvov]], not least as the war could now be portrayed as a clash between liberal governments and the autocratic Central Powers. Like many observers he had been taken by surprise by the exact timing of the revolution (it had not been predicted by [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]] or [[Henry Hughes Wilson|General Wilson]] on their visit to Russia a few weeks earlier) and hoped – albeit with some concerns – that Russia's war effort would be invigorated like that of France in the early 1790s.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=58–59}}</ref>

Lloyd George gave a cautious welcome to the suggestion (19 March on the western calendar) of the Russian Foreign Minister [[Pavel Milyukov]] that the toppled Tsar and his family be given sanctuary in Britain (although Lloyd George would have preferred that they go to a neutral country). From the very start the King's adviser [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Stamfordham]] raised objections, and in April the British government withdrew its consent under Royal pressure. Eventually the Russian Royal Family were moved to the Urals where they were [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed in 1918]]. Lloyd George was often blamed for the refusal of asylum, and in his memoirs he did not mention [[George V|King George V]]'s role in the matter, which was not explicitly confirmed until [[Kenneth Rose]]'s biography of the King was published in 1983.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=60–61}}</ref>

====Imperial War Cabinet====
[[File:The Right Hon. David Lloyd George.jpg | thumb|left | David Lloyd George circa 1918]]
An [[Imperial War Cabinet]], including representatives from Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India, met in March–May 1917 (a crisis period of the war) and twice in 1918. The idea was not entirely without precedent as there had been Imperial Conferences in 1902, 1907 and 1911, whilst the Australian Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] had been invited to attend the Cabinet and War Committee on his visit to the UK in the spring of 1916. The South African [[Jan Smuts]] was appointed to the British War Cabinet in the early summer of 1917.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=62–63}}</ref>

====Passchendaele====
Lloyd George set up a War Policy Committee (himself, Curzon, Milner, Law and Smuts, with [[Maurice Hankey, 1st Baron Hankey|Maurice Hankey]] as secretary) to discuss strategy, which held 16 meetings over the next six weeks. At the very first meeting (11 June) Lloyd George proposed helping the Italians to capture Trieste,<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=136–138}}</ref> explicitly telling the War Policy Committee (21 June 1917) that he wanted Italian soldiers to be killed rather than British.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | p=80}}</ref>

Haig believed that a Flanders Offensive had good chance of clearing the Belgian coast, from which German submarines and destroyers were operating (a popular goal with politicians), and that victory at Ypres "might quite possibly lead to (German) collapse". Robertson was less optimistic, but preferred Britain to keep her focus on defeating Germany on the Western Front, and had told Haig that the politicians would not "dare" overrule both soldiers if they gave the same advice. Haig promised he had no "intention of entering into a tremendous offensive involving heavy losses" (20 June) whilst Robertson wanted to avoid "disproportionate loss" (23 June).<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=136–140}}</ref>

The Flanders Offensive was reluctantly sanctioned by the War Policy Committee on 18 July and the War Cabinet two days later, on condition it did not degenerate into a long drawn-out fight like the Somme. The War Cabinet promised to monitor progress and casualties and, if necessary call a halt, although in the event they made little effort to monitor progress until September. Frustrated at his inability to get his way, Lloyd George talked of resigning and taking his case to the public.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=139–142}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Passchendaele]] began on 31 July, but soon became bogged down in unseasonably early wet weather, which turned much of the battlefield into barely passable swamp in which men and animals sometimes drowned, whilst the mud and rain severely reduced the accuracy and effectiveness of artillery, the dominant weapon of the time. Lloyd George tried to enlist the King for diverting efforts against Austria-Hungary, telling [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Stamfordham]] (14 August) that the King and Prime Minister were "joint trustees of the nation" who had to avoid waste of manpower. A [[Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo|new Italian offensive]] began (18 August), but Robertson advised that it was "false strategy" to call off Passchendaele to send reinforcements to Italy, and despite being summoned to [[George Riddell, 1st Baron Riddell|George Riddell]]'s home in Sussex, where he was served apple pudding (his favourite dish), agreed only reluctantly. The Anglo-French leadership agreed in early September to send 100 heavy guns to Italy (50 of them French) rather than the 300 which Lloyd George wanted – Lloyd George talked of ordering a halt to Passchendaele, but in Hankey's words "funked it" (4 September). Had he not done so his government might have fallen, for as soon as the guns reached Italy [[Luigi Cadorna|Cadorna]] called off his offensive (21 September).<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=144–146}}</ref>

At a meeting at Boulogne (25 September) Lloyd George broached with [[Paul Painlevé|Painlevé]] the setting up of an Allied Supreme War Council then making [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]] generalissimo.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=190–191}}</ref> Bonar Law had written to Lloyd George that ministers must soon decide whether or not the offensive was to continue. Lloyd George and Robertson met Haig in France (26 September) to discuss the recent German peace feelers (which in the end were publicly repudiated by Chancellor [[Georg Michaelis|Michaelis]])<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=146–148}}</ref> and the progress of the offensive. Haig preferred to continue, encouraged by [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Plumer]]'s recent successful attacks in dry weather at [[Battle of the Menin Road Ridge|Menin Road]] (20 September) and [[Battle of Polygon Wood|Polygon Wood]] (26 September), and stating that the Germans were "very worn out". In October the wet weather returned for the final attack towards Passchendaele.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=148–149}}</ref> At the final meeting of the War Policy Committee on 11 October 1917, Lloyd George authorised the offensive to continue, but warning of failure in three weeks' time. [[Maurice Hankey|Hankey]] (21 October) claimed in his diary that Lloyd George had deliberately allowed Passchendaele to continue in order to discredit Haig and Robertson and make it easier for him to forbid similar offensives in 1918.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=64–65, 190–191}}</ref>

====Supreme War Council====
Lloyd George played a critical role in the Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour]]'s famous [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Declaration]]: "His Majesty's government view with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the [[Jewish people]], and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

The Italians suffered disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]], requiring British and French reinforcements to be sent. Lloyd George said he "wanted to take advantage of Caporetto to gain "control of the War".<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | p=191}}</ref> The [[Supreme War Council]] was inaugurated at the [[Rapallo Conference]] (6–7 November 1917). Lloyd George then gave a controversial speech at Paris (12 November) at which he criticised the high casualties of recent Allied "victories" (a word which he used with an element of sarcasm). These events led to an angry Commons debate (19 November), which Lloyd George survived.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=192–194}}</ref>

In reply to Robertson's 19 November memo, which warned (correctly) that the Germans would use the opportunity of [[Treaty of Brest Litovsk|Russia's departure from the war]] to attack in 1918 before the Americans were present in strength, Lloyd George wrote (wrongly) that the Germans would not attack and would fail if they did. That autumn he declared that he was willing "to risk his whole political reputation" to avoid a repetition of the Somme or Passchendaele.<ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=173–174, 178}}</ref>

In December 1917, Lloyd George remarked to [[C. P. Scott]] that: "If people really knew, the war would be stopped tomorrow. But of course they don't know, and can't know."

====Manpower crisis and the Unions====
A Manpower Committee was set up on 6 December 1917, consisting of the Prime Minister, Curzon, Carson, [[George Nicoll Barnes|George Barnes]] and Smuts with [[Maurice Hankey]] and [[Auckland Geddes, 1st Baron Geddes|Auckland Geddes]] ([[Director of National Service|Minister of National Service]] – in charge of Army recruitment) in regular attendance.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | p=366}}</ref> The first meeting of the Manpower Committee was on 10 December, and it met twice the next day and again on 15 December. Lloyd George questioned Generals [[Nevil Macready|Macready]] (Adjutant-General) and [[George Macdonogh|Macdonogh]] (Chief of Military Intelligence), who advised that the Allied superiority of numbers on the Western Front would not survive the transfer of German reinforcements from the East now that Russia was dropping out of the war. Deeply concerned about the publicity attracted by the recent [[Lansdowne Letter]]'s mention of casualties, he suggested removing Haig and Robertson from office at this time, but this was met by a threat of resignation from Lord Derby. At this stage Lloyd George opposed extending conscription to Ireland – Carson advised that extending conscription to Ulster alone would be impractical.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=366–369}}</ref>

When Hankey's report eventually emerged it reflected Lloyd George's wishes: it gave top priority to shipbuilding and merchant shipping (not least to ship US troops to Europe), and placed Army manpower below both weapons production and civilian industry. The size of the Army in Britain was to be reduced from eight divisions to four, freeing about 40,000 men for service in France.<ref name="harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=369–370">{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=369–370}}</ref>  In the House of Commons (20 December) Lloyd George also argued that the collapse of Russia and [[Battle of Caporetto|defeat of Italy]] required further "combing-out" of men from industry, in breach of pledges given to the trade unions in 1916. Auckland Geddes was given increased powers to direct labour – a new bill became law, despite the opposition of the Engineers' Union, in February 1918.<ref name="harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=369–370"/> The unions were placated with the [[Caxton Hall]] conference (5 January 1918), at which Lloyd George outlined Allied war aims.  He called for Germany to be stripped of her conquests (including her colonies and Alsace-Lorraine, annexed in 1871) and democratised (although he was clear that this was not an Allied war aim, but something which would help to ensure the future peace of Europe), and for the liberation of the subject peoples of Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Empire. He also hinted at [[World War I reparations|reparations]] (although it was suggested that these would not be on the scale that imdemnified France after 1871) and [[League of Nations|a new international order]].  Lloyd George explained to critics that he was hoping to detach Austria-Hungary and turn the German people against her rulers; the speech greatly increased his support amongst trade unions and the Labour Party.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=380–383}}</ref> President Wilson at first considered abandoning his speech outlining US war aims - the "[[Fourteen Points]]", many of which were similar to the aims outlined by Lloyd George - but was persuaded by his adviser [[Edward M. House|Colonel House]] to deliver it.  The speech (8 January) overshadowed Lloyd George's, and is better remembered by posterity.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=383–385}}</ref>

====Strategic priorities====
Lloyd George had told [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]], who was appointed the new commander in Egypt in June, that his objective was "Jerusalem before Christmas" and that he had only to ask for reinforcements, although the exact nature of his offensives was still undecided when he was appointed. Amidst months of argument throughout the autumn of 1917 Robertson was able to block Lloyd George's plan to make [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] the main theatre of operations by having Allenby make the impossible demand that thirteen extra divisions be sent to him.<ref>{{harvnb | Corrigan | 2003 | p=323}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb | Woodward | 1998 | pp=155–159}}</ref> Allenby captured [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Jerusalem]] in December 1917.

In the winter of 1917/18 Lloyd George secured the resignations of both the service chiefs. Removing the First Sea Lord [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Admiral Jellicoe]] earlier in 1917, as Lloyd George wanted, would have been politically impossible given Conservative anger at the return of [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] (still blamed for the Dardanelles) to office as [[Minister of Munitions]] in July, and Lloyd George's preoccupations with Passchendaele, Caporetto and the Supreme War Council from July onward. By December it was clear that Lloyd George would have to sack Jellicoe or lose Eric Geddes (First Lord of the Admiralty), who wanted to return to his previous job in charge of military transport in France. The Christmas holiday, when Parliament was not sitting, provided a good opportunity. Before Jellicoe left for leave on Christmas Eve he received a letter from Geddes demanding his resignation. The other Sea Lords talked of resigning but did not do so, whilst Jellicoe's ally Carson remained a member of the War Cabinet until he resigned in January over Irish Home Rule.<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=371–375}}</ref>

Relations with [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|General Robertson]] had worsened further over the creation of the [[Supreme War Council]] at Versailles and he was eventually forced out over his insistence that the British delegate there be subordinate to Robertson as CIGS in London.

====Home Front====
[[File:Order of Merit in Westminster Cathedral (cropped).jpg | thumb|right | 120px | <center>'''Order of Merit'''</center>]]
The War Cabinet was a very successful innovation. It met almost daily, with [[Maurice Hankey]] as secretary, and made all major political, military, economic and diplomatic decisions. [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|Rationing]] was finally imposed in early 1918 for meat, sugar and fats (butter and oleo) – but not bread; the new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918 trade-union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million. Work stoppages and strikes became frequent in 1917–18 as the unions expressed grievances regarding prices, liquor control, pay disputes, "dilution", fatigue from overtime and from Sunday work, and inadequate housing.

The Corn Production Act of 1917 bestowed upon the Board of Agriculture the power to ensure that all land was properly cultivated, appointed a wages board to operate a new minimum wage in agriculture, and guaranteed minimum prices for wheat and oats.<ref>{{harvnb | Thorpe | 2014 | p=89}}</ref>

Also in 1918 George was one of the many infected during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], but he survived.<ref>Collier 1974</ref>
[[Conscription]] put into uniform nearly every physically fit man, six million out of ten million eligible.  Of these about 750,000 lost their lives and 1,700,000 were wounded.  Most deaths were of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost their husbands and 300,000 children lost their fathers.<ref>{{harvnb | Havighurst | 1966 | pp=134–135}}</ref>

====Crises of 1918====
In rapid succession in spring 1918 came a series of military and political crises.<ref>{{harvnb | Taylor | 1965 | pp=100–106}}</ref> The Germans, having moved troops from the Eastern front and retrained them in new tactics, now had more soldiers on the Western Front than the Allies.  Germany launched the full scale [[Spring Offensive]] starting on 21 March against the British and French lines, hoping for victory on the battlefield before the American troops arrived in numbers.  The Allied armies fell back 40 miles in confusion, and facing defeat London realised it needed more troops to fight a mobile war.  Lloyd George found a half million soldiers and rushed them to France, asked American President Woodrow Wilson for immediate help, and agreed to the appointment of French General Foch as commander in chief on the Western Front.  He considered taking on the role of War Minister himself, but was dissuaded by the king, and instead appointed [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]].<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=478–483}}</ref>

Despite strong warnings that it was a bad idea, the War Cabinet [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|decided to impose conscription on Ireland]]. The main reason was that trade unions in Britain demanded it as the price for cutting back on conscription exemptions for certain workers. Labour wanted the principle established that no one was exempt, but it did not demand that conscription actually take place in Ireland. The proposal was enacted but never enforced. The Catholic bishops for the first time entered the fray and called for open resistance to conscription. Many Irish Catholics and nationalists moved into [[Sinn Féin]], a decisive moment marking the dominance of Irish politics by a party committed to leaving the UK altogether.<ref>{{harvnb | Ward | 1974 | pp=107–129}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=465–488}}</ref>

At one point Lloyd George unknowingly misled the House of Commons in claiming that Haig's forces were stronger at the start of 1918 than they had been a year earlier – in fact the increase was in the number of labourers, most of them [[Chinese Labour Corps|Chinese]], Indians and black South Africans, and Haig had fewer infantry, holding a longer stretch of front.<ref>{{harvnb | Hart | 2008 | p=229}}</ref>  The prime minister had used incorrect information furnished by the War Department office headed by Major-General Sir [[Frederick Barton Maurice|Frederick Maurice]].  Maurice then made the [[The Maurice Debate|spectacular public allegation]] that the War Cabinet had deliberately held soldiers back from the Western Front, and both Lloyd George and Bonar Law had lied to Parliament about it.  Instead of going to the prime minister about the problem Maurice had waited and then broke [[Queen's Regulations|King's Regulations]] by making a public attack.  Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George, which further ripped apart the Liberal Party.  While Asquith's presentation was poorly done, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations.<ref>{{harvnb | Gooch | 1968 | pp=211–228}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 2002c | pp=489–512}}</ref>
Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled. By summer the Americans were sending 10,000 fresh men a day to the Western Front, a speedup made possible by leaving their equipment behind and using British and French munitions. The German army had used up its last reserves and was steadily shrinking in numbers, further weakening its resolve.  Victory came on 11 November 1918.<ref>{{harvnb | Taylor | 1965 | pp=108–111}}</ref>

===Postwar Prime Minister (1918–1922)===

At the end of the war Lloyd George's reputation stood at its zenith.  Bonar Law, who was from a similar working-class background said, "He can be dictator for life if he wishes."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2011/01/coalition-liberal-conservative | title=The coalition is held together by fear | last=Bogdanor | first=Vernon | authorlink= Vernon Bogdanor | date=2011-01-20 | work=[[New Statesman]] | accessdate=29 August 2014}}</ref> Headlines at this time declared a "huge majority win" and that "[[pacifists]], even 'shining lights' such as [[Arnold Lupton]], had been completely overthrown by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Philip Snowden]]".<ref>{{cite news | last= | first= | url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=AS19190317.2.112 | title=The Victory Election – Pacifists Swept Away | date=17 March 1919 | work=[[Auckland Star]] | accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref>

====Coupon election of 1918====
{{main | United Kingdom general election, 1918}}
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1918|"Coupon election" of December 1918]] he led a coalition of Conservatives and his own faction of Liberals to a landslide victory.<ref>{{harvnb | Turner | 1992 | pp=317–333}}</ref> Coalition candidates received a "coupon" (an endorsement letter signed by Lloyd George and Bonar Law). Wilson argues that by sending a "coupon" to so many Conservative candidates he broke with liberalism and linked his political future with the Conservatives.<ref>{{harvnb | Wilson | 1964 | pp=28–42}}</ref>  He did not say, "We shall squeeze the German lemon until the pips squeak" (that was [[Eric Campbell Geddes|Sir Eric Geddes]]), but he did express that sentiment about reparations from Germany to pay the entire cost of the war, including pensions. He said that German industrial capacity "will go a pretty long way". We must have "the uttermost farthing", and "shall search their pockets for it".<ref>{{harvnb | Rose | 1999 | pp=14–15}}</ref> As the campaign closed, he summarised his programme:<ref>{{harvnb | Havighurst | 1985 | p=149}}</ref>

# Trial of the [[William II, German Emperor|exiled Kaiser Wilhelm II]];
# Punishment of those guilty of atrocities;
# Fullest indemnity from Germany;
# Britain for the British, socially and industrially;
# Rehabilitation of those broken in the war; and
# A happier country for all.

The election was fought not so much on the peace issue and what to do with Germany, although those themes played a role. More important was the voters' evaluation of Lloyd George in terms of what he had accomplished so far and what he promised for the future. His supporters emphasised that he had won the Great War. Against his strong record in social legislation, he himself called for making "a country fit for heroes to live in".<ref>{{harvnb | Taylor | 1965 | pp=127–128}}</ref>

His "National Liberal" coalition gained an overwhelming victory, winning 525 of the 707 seats contested; however, the Conservatives had control within the Coalition of more than two-thirds of its seats. Asquith's independent Liberals were crushed and emerged with only 33 seats, although they were still the official opposition as the two Liberal factions combined had more seats than Labour.<ref>{{harvnb | Havighurst | 1966 | p=151}}</ref>

====Versailles 1919====
[[File:ClemenceauLloydGeorgeYOrlando.jpg | thumb|right | 250px | Georges Clemenceau, David Lloyd George and Vittorio Orlando at Versailles]]
Lloyd George represented Britain at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]], clashing with the French Prime Minister, [[Georges Clemenceau]], the US President, [[Woodrow Wilson]], and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], [[Vittorio Orlando]].<ref>{{harvnb | MacMillan | 2001}}</ref> Unlike Clemenceau and Orlando, Lloyd George on the whole stood on the side of generosity and moderation. He did not want to utterly destroy the German economy and political system—as Clemenceau demanded—with massive reparations. The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] looked askance at Lloyd George's economic credentials in ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace'', calling the Prime Minister a "half-human visitor to our age from the hag-ridden magic and enchanted woods of [[Celts|Celtic]] antiquity".

Lloyd George was also responsible for the pro-German shift in the peace conditions regarding borders of Poland. Instead of handing over [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|Upper Silesia]] (2,073,000 people), and the [[East Prussian plebiscite|southern part of East Prussia]] (720,000 people) to Poland as was planned before, the plebiscite was organised. [[Danzig]] (366,000 people) was organised as [[Free City of Danzig]].  Poles were grateful that he had saved that country from the Bolsheviks but were annoyed by his comment that Poles were "children who gave trouble".<ref>{{harvnb | Davies | 1971 | pp=132–154}}</ref>  Asked how he had done at the peace conference, he commented, "I think I did as well as might be expected, seated as I was between Jesus Christ [Wilson] and Napoleon Bonaparte [Clemenceau]."<ref>{{harvnb | Cashman | 1988 | p=526}}</ref>

====Postwar social reforms====
[[File:LloydGeorge.jpg | thumb|left | David Lloyd George circa 1920]]
A major programme of social reform was introduced under Lloyd George in the last months of the war, and in the post-war years. The Workmen's Compensation (Silicosis) Act of 1918 (which was introduced a year later) allowed for compensation to be paid to men "who could prove they had worked in rock which contained no less than 80% silica."<ref>{{harvnb | McIvor | Johnston | 2007 | p=74}}</ref> The [[Education Act 1918]] raised the school leaving age to 14, increased the powers and duties of the Board of Education (together with the money it could provide to Local Education Authorities), and introduced a system of day-continuation schools which youths between the ages of 14 and 16 "could be compelled to attend for at least one day a week".<ref>{{harvnb | Hill | 1975}}</ref> The 1920 Blind Persons Act provided assistance for unemployed blind people and blind persons who were in low paid employment.<ref>{{harvnb | Thomas | Smith | 2008}}</ref>

The [[Housing and Town Planning Act 1919]] provided subsidies for house building by local authorities, and a total of 170,000 homes were built under this Act.  This was a landmark measure, in that it established, according to [[A. J. P. Taylor]], "the principle that housing was a social service".<ref name="ReferenceA">{{harvnb | Taylor | 1988}}</ref> Under the 1919 Housing Act, 30,000 houses were constructed by private enterprise with government subsidy.<ref name="ReferenceC">{{harvnb | Thane | 1996}}</ref> 
The [[Land Settlement (Facilities) Act 1919]] and Land Settlement (Scotland) Acts of 1919 encouraged local authorities to provide land for people to take up farming "and also to provide allotments in urban areas."

==== Electoral changes: Suffragism ====
{{main | Women's suffrage in Wales#David Lloyd George and the suffrage movement, 1907-1912}}
The [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] greatly extended the franchise for men (by abolishing most property qualifications) and gave the vote to many women over 30, and the [[Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918]] enabled women to sit in the House of Commons.  The [[Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919]] provided that "A person shall not be disqualified by sex or marriage from the exercise of any public function, or from being appointed to or holding any civil or judicial office or post, or from entering or assuming or carrying on any civil profession or vocation, or for admission to any incorporated society...". The Rent Act of 1920 safeguarded working-class tenants against exorbitant rent increases.<ref>{{harvnb | Lowe | 1984}}</ref> Rent controls were continued after the war, and an "out-of-work donation" was introduced for ex-servicemen and civilians.<ref name="ReferenceC"/>

==== Wages for Workers ====
The [[Unemployment Insurance Act 1920]] extended [[national insurance]] to 11 million additional workers. This was considered to be a revolutionary measure, in that it extended unemployment insurance to almost the entire labour force, whereas only certain categories of workers had been covered before.<ref name="ReferenceB">{{harvnb | Davies | 1994}}</ref> As a result of this legislation, roughly three-quarters of the British workforce were now covered by unemployment insurance.<ref>{{harvnb | Timmins | 2001}}</ref>

The [[Agriculture Act 1920]] provided for farm labourers to receive a minimum wage while the state continued to guarantee the prices of farm produce until 1921. It also provided tenant farmers with greater protection by granting them better security of tenure<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In education, teachers' salaries were standardised (in 1921) through the Burnham Scale.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

The [[Mining Industry Act 1920]] placed a mandatory requirement to provide social welfare opportunities to mining communities,<ref>{{cite web | title=Coal still uniting the community | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/southeastwales/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_7777000/7777620.stm | date=2008-12-11 | access-date=2016-02-10 | website=bbc.co.uk }}</ref> while the Public Health (Tuberculosis) Act of 1921 increased the obligation of local authorities to treat and prevent TB.<ref>{{harvnb | Thorpe | 2014}}</ref>

==== Health for the Heroes ====
In 1919, the government set up a Ministry of Health, a development which led to major improvements in public health in the years that followed.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> whilst the Unemployed Workers' Dependants (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1921 provided payments for the wives and dependent children of unemployed workers.<ref>{{harvnb | Mowat | 1955}}</ref> The Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act (1920) prohibited the employment of children below the limit of compulsory school age in railways and transport undertakings, building and engineering construction works, factories, and mines. The legislation also prohibited the employment of children in ships at sea (except in certain circumstances, such as in respect of family members employed on the same vessel).<ref>{{harvnb | Byrne | Padfield | 1978}}</ref>
[[File:David Lloyd George gcf10404.jpg|thumb|Portrait of David Lloyd George, 1915]]
The [[National Health Insurance Act 1920]] increased insurance benefits, and eligibility for pensions was extended to more people.  The means limit for pensions was raised by about two-thirds, aliens and their wives were allowed to receive pensions after living in Britain for ten years, and the imprisonment and "failure to work" disqualifications for receiving pensions were abolished.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> In addition, pensions were introduced for blind persons aged fifty and above.<ref>{{harvnb | Radhakrishnan | 1992}}</ref>

Old age pensions were doubled, efforts were made to help returning soldiers find employment, and the [[Whitley Councils]] were established to arbitrate between employees and employers.<ref name="ReferenceB"/><ref>{{harvnb | Hamilton | 1941}}</ref>

==== What was the cost? ====
The reforming efforts of the Coalition Government were such that, according to the historian [[Kenneth O. Morgan]], its achievements were greater than those of the pre-war Liberal governments. However, the reform programme was substantially rolled back by the [[Geddes Axe]], which cut public expenditure by £76 million, including substantial cuts to education,<ref>{{harvnb | Pearce | Stewart | 2002}}</ref> and abolished the Agricultural Wages Board.<ref>{{harvnb | Hattersley | 2010}}</ref>

====Ireland====
An armed insurrection by Irish republicans known as the [[Easter Rising]] took place in [[Dublin]] during Easter Week, 1916.  The government responded with harsh repression and some executions.  The Catholic Irish then underwent a dramatic change of mood, and shifted to demand vengeance and independence.<ref>{{harvnb | McGarry | 2010 | pp=262–263}}</ref>  In 1917 Lloyd George called the 1917–18 [[Irish Convention]] in an attempt to settle the outstanding [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Home Rule for Ireland]] issue. However, the upsurge in republican sympathies in Ireland following the Easter Rising coupled with Lloyd George's disastrous attempt to extend [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription to Ireland]] in April 1918 led to the wipeout of the old [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Irish Home Rule Party]] at the December 1918 election. Replaced by [[Sinn Féin]] MPs, they immediately declared an [[Irish Republic]].

Lloyd George presided over the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] which partitioned Ireland into [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] in May 1921 during [[Anglo-Irish War|the war of independence]].  Lloyd George famously declared of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] that "We have murder by the throat!" However, he soon afterwards began negotiations with IRA leaders to recognise their authority and to end a bloody conflict.  This culminated in the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] signed in December 1921 with Irish leaders. Under it Southern Ireland, representing over a fifth of the United Kingdom's territory, seceded in 1922 to form the [[Irish Free State]].

====Fall from power 1922====
[[File:David Lloyd George cph.3c33019.jpg | thumb|Lloyd George in 1922]]
Deep fissures quickly emerged in Lloyd George's coalition.

In May 1920 a Soviet trade delegation led by [[Leonid Krasin|Krasin]] visited Britain, and on its second visit in August it was accompanied by [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]], a leading member of the Soviet regime. Coming so soon after the Russian Revolution and against the backdrop of the [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] in summer 1920, this was of deep concern to [[Henry Hughes Wilson, 1st Baronet|Field Marshal Wilson]], the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|head of the British Army]], who thought Lloyd George "a traitor & a Bolshevist".  The [[Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement]] was signed on 16 March 1921.<ref>{{Harvnb | Crosby | 2014 | pp=276, 278–279, 474}}</ref>
The more traditional wing of the Unionist Party had no intention of introducing reforms, which led to three years of frustrated fighting within the coalition both between the National Liberals and the Unionists and between factions within the Conservatives themselves.  Many Conservatives were angered by the granting of independence to the Irish Free State and by [[Edwin Samuel Montagu|Montagu]]'s moves towards [[Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms|limited self-government for India]], while a [[Depression of 1920-21|sharp economic downturn]] and [[Triple Alliance (1914)#The Post-War Triple Alliance|wave of strikes]] in 1921 damaged Lloyd George's credibility.  In June 1922 Conservatives were able to show that he had been selling knighthoods and [[peerage]]s – and the [[Order of the British Empire]] which was created in 1917 – for money. Conservatives were concerned by his desire to create a party from these funds comprising [[moderate]] Liberals and themselves.  A major attack in the [[House of Lords]] followed on his corruption resulting in the [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925]].  The Conservatives also attacked Lloyd George as lacking any executive [[accountability]] as Prime Minister, claiming that he never turned up to [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]] meetings and banished some government departments to the gardens of [[10 Downing Street]].

[[File:David Lloyd George statue next to Caernarfon Castle.JPG | thumb|Lloyd George statue at Caernarfon Castle (1921), in recognition of his service as local MP and Prime Minister]]

The coalition was dealt its final blow on 19 October 1922.  After criticism of Lloyd George over the [[Chanak crisis]] as part of Britain's foreign policy in [[Turkey]], the Conservative leader, [[Austen Chamberlain]], summoned a [[Carlton Club meeting, 19 October 1922|meeting of Conservative Members of Parliament]] at the [[Carlton Club]] to discuss their attitude to the Coalition in the forthcoming election. Chamberlain and other Conservatives such as Arthur Balfour argued for supporting Lloyd George, while former party leader [[Bonar Law]] argued the other way, claiming that breaking up the coalition "wouldn't break Lloyd George's heart".  The main attack came from [[Stanley Baldwin]], then President of the Board of Trade, who spoke of Lloyd George as a "dynamic force" who would break the Conservative Party.  Baldwin and many of the more progressive members, like Austen Chamberlain, of the Conservative Party, and those who fundamentally opposed Lloyd George split.  They sealed Lloyd George's fate with a vote of 187 to 87<ref>{{cite book|last=Bogdanor|first=Vernon|authorlink=Vernon Bogdanor|title=The Coalition and the Constitution|year=2011|publisher=Hart Publishing|isbn=9781849461580|page=78|chapter='England Does Not Love Coalitions'}}</ref> in favour of the motion "That this meeting of Conservative members of the House of Commons declares its opinion that the Conservative Party, whilst willing to cooperate with Coalition Liberals, fights the election as an independent party, with its own leader and its own programme." Chamberlain resigned the same day.<ref>{{harvnb | Ramsden | 1998 | p=244 }}</ref>

==Later political career (1922–1945)==
[[File:David Lloyd George - Project Gutenberg eText 15306.jpg | thumb|left | upright | David Lloyd George]]
Throughout the 1920s Lloyd George remained highly visible in politics; predictions that he would return to power were common, but it never happened.<ref>{{harvnb | Campbell | 1977}}</ref> Before the [[United Kingdom general election|1923 election]], he resolved his dispute with Asquith, allowing the Liberals to run a united ticket against [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s policy of protective tariffs. Baldwin both feared and despised Lloyd George, and one of his aims was to keep him out of power. He later claimed that he had adopted tariffs, which cost the Conservatives their majority, out of concern that Lloyd George was about to do so on his return from a tour of North America. Although there was press speculation at the time that Lloyd George would do so (or adopt [[US-style Prohibition]] to appeal to [[Representation of the People Act 1918|newly enfranchised]] women voters), there is no evidence that this was his intent.<ref>{{harvnb | Campbell | 1977 | pp=47–47}}</ref> At the [[United Kingdom general election|1924 general election]], Baldwin won a clear victory, the leading coalitionists such as Austen Chamberlain and Lord Birkenhead (and former Liberal [[Winston Churchill]]) agreeing to serve under Baldwin and thus ruling out any restoration of the 1916–22 coalition.

===Liberal leader===
The disastrous election result in 1924 left the Liberals as a weak third party in British politics.  As Asquith had lost his seat in the Commons, Lloyd George became chairman of the Liberal MPs then, in 1926 succeeded him as Liberal leader. Lloyd George used his fund to finance candidates and put forward innovative ideas for public works to reduce unemployment (as detailed in pamphlets such as the "Yellow Book" and the "Green Book").  Lloyd George was also helped by [[John Maynard Keynes]] to write ''We can Conquer Unemployment'', setting out economic policies to solve unemployment.  In 1927 the party faced historic charges of corruption first raised during Rosebery's period of ineffectual party management in the 1890s.  The tendency had been for party leaders to award generously titles for political work.<ref>{{harvnb | McKinstry | 2005 | p=375}}</ref> Moreover, Lloyd George had been highly critical at the time of the aristocratic circus.

However the results at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]] were disappointing: the Liberals increased their support only to 60 or so seats, while Labour became the largest party for the first time. Once again, the Liberals ended up supporting a minority Labour government. In 1929 Lloyd George became [[Father of the House]], the longest-serving member of the Commons.

===Marginalised===
In 1931 an illness prevented his joining the [[UK National Government|National Government]] when it was formed. Later when the National Government called a General Election he tried to pull the Liberal Party out of it but succeeded in taking only a few followers, most of whom were related to him; the main Liberal party remained in the coalition for a year longer, under the leadership of [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Sir Herbert Samuel]]. By the 1930s Lloyd George was on the margins of British politics, although still intermittently in the public eye and publishing his War Memoirs. Lloyd George was President of the London Welsh Trust, which runs the [[London Welsh Centre]], Gray's Inn Road, from 1934 until 1935.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.londonwelsh.org/archives/1796 | title=Our Former Presidents: London Welsh Centre | publisher=[[London Welsh Centre]] | accessdate=2011-02-04 | work=[[London Welsh Centre]] website | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025944/http://www.londonwelsh.org/archives/1796 | archive-date=2011-07-20}}</ref>

===Lloyd George's "New Deal"===
[[File:LloydGeorgeEn1932.jpeg | thumb|Lloyd George in 1932]]
In January 1935 Lloyd George announced a programme of economic reform, called "Lloyd George's New Deal" after the American [[New Deal]]. This [[John Maynard Keynes|Keynesian]] economic programme was essentially the same as that of 1929. MacDonald requested that he put his case before the Cabinet, and so in March Lloyd George submitted a 100-page memorandum that was cross-examined between April and June in ten meetings of the Cabinet's sub-committee. However, the programme did not find favour; two-thirds of Conservative MPs were against Lloyd George's joining the National government, and some Cabinet members would have resigned if he had joined.<ref>{{harvnb | Jones | 1951 | pp=238–239}}</ref>

===Appeasement of Germany===
Rudman argues that Lloyd George was consistently pro-German after 1923. He supported German demands for territorial concessions and recognition of its "great power" status; he paid much less attention to the security concerns of [[France]], [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Belgium]].<ref>{{harvnb | Rudman | 2011 | loc=ch 5–8}}</ref> The Germans welcomed him as a friend in the highest circles of British politics. In September 1936 he went to Germany to talk with the German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]]. Hitler said he was pleased to have met "the man who won the war"; Lloyd George was moved, and called Hitler "the greatest living German".<ref>{{harvnb | Jones | 1951 | p=247}}</ref> Lloyd George also visited Germany's public works programmes and was impressed. On his return to Britain he wrote an article for ''[[The Daily Express]]'' praising Hitler; he wrote, "The Germans have definitely made up their minds never to quarrel with us again."<ref name="Jones">{{harvnb | Jones | 1951 | p=248}}</ref> He believed Hitler was "the George Washington of Germany"; that he was rearming Germany for defence and not for offensive war; that a war between Germany and Russia would not happen for at least ten years; that Hitler admired the British and wanted their friendship but that there was no British leadership to exploit this.<ref name="Jones" /> However, by 1938, Lloyd George's distaste for [[Neville Chamberlain]] led him to disavow Chamberlain's appeasement policies.

===Last years===
In the last important parliamentary intervention of his career, which occurred during the crucial [[Norway Debate]] of May 1940, Lloyd George made a powerful speech that helped to undermine Chamberlain as Prime Minister and to pave the way for the ascendancy of Churchill. Churchill offered Lloyd George the agriculture portfolio in his Cabinet but he refused, citing his unwillingness to sit alongside Chamberlain. Lloyd George also thought that Britain's chances in the war were dim, and he remarked to his secretary: "I shall wait until Winston is bust."<ref>{{harvnb | Cross | 1975 | p=281}}</ref> He wrote to the [[Hastings Russell, 12th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] in September 1940 advocating a negotiated peace with Germany after the [[Battle of Britain]].<ref>{{harvnb | Reynolds | 2006 | p=79}}</ref>

A pessimistic speech by Lloyd George on 7 May 1941 led Churchill to compare him with [[Philippe Pétain]]. On 11 June 1942 he made his last-ever speech in the House of Commons, and he cast his last vote in the Commons on 18 February 1943 as one of the 121 MPs (97 Labour) condemning the Government for its failure to back the [[Beveridge Report]]. Fittingly, his final vote was in defence of the welfare state which he had helped to create.<ref>{{harvnb | Addison | 1994 | pp=224–225}}</ref>

Increasingly in his late years his characteristic political courage gave way to physical timidity and hypochondria. He continued to attend Castle Street Baptist Chapel in London, and to preside over the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|national eisteddfod]] at its Thursday session each summer. At the end, he returned to Wales. In September 1944, he and Frances left [[Churt]] for Tŷ Newydd, a farm near his boyhood home in Llanystumdwy. He was now weakening rapidly and his voice failing. He was still an MP but had learned that wartime changes in the constituency meant that Carnarvon Boroughs might go Conservative at the next election. On [[New Years Day]] 1945 Lloyd George was raised to the [[peerage]] as [[Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor]], and Viscount Gwynedd, of [[Dwyfor]] in the [[Historic counties of Wales|County]] of [[Caernarvonshire]]. Under the rules governing titles within the peerage, Lloyd George's name in his title was hyphenated even though his surname was not.

[[File:Bedd David Lloyd George Llanystumdwy David Lloyd George's Grave - geograph.org.uk - 469205.jpg | left|thumb | 200px | Lloyd George's grave, Llanystumdwy]]
As it happened, he did not live long enough to take his seat in the [[House of Lords]]. He died of [[cancer]] on 26 March 1945, aged 82, his wife Frances and his daughter Megan at his bedside. Four days later, on [[Good Friday]], he was buried beside the [[Afon Dwyfor|river Dwyfor]] in [[Llanystumdwy]].

A great boulder marks his grave; there is no inscription. However a monument designed by the architect Sir [[Clough Williams-Ellis]] was subsequently erected around the grave, bearing an [[englyn]] (strict-metre stanza) engraved on slate in his memory composed by his nephew Dr [[William R. P. George|William George]].<ref>{{Find a Grave | 4966}}</ref> Nearby stands the [[Lloyd George Museum]], also designed by Williams-Ellis and opened in 1963.

==Family==

===Margaret & children===
[[File:TNA COPY1-560-129 David and Megan Lloyd George.jpg | thumb|right | David Lloyd George with his daughter Megan in 1911]]
He had five children by his first wife, Margaret: Richard (1889–1968), Mair (1890–1907, who died during an [[appendectomy]]), Olwen (1892–1990), Gwilym (1894–1967) and Megan (1902–1966). He remained married to Margaret, and remained fond of her until her death<ref>{{harvnb | Longford | 1996 | p=6}}</ref> on 20 January 1941; Lloyd George was deeply upset by the fact that bad weather prevented him from being with her when she died.

His son, [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym]], and his daughter, [[Megan Lloyd George|Megan]], both followed him into politics, and were elected members of parliament. They were politically faithful to their father throughout his life, but after 1945 each drifted away from the Liberal Party, Gwilym finishing his career as a Conservative [[Home Secretary]] and Megan becoming a Labour MP in 1957, perhaps symbolising the fate of much of the old Liberal Party.

===Frances===
In October 1943, aged 80, and to the disapproval of his children,<ref>{{harvnb | Longford | 1996 | pp=154–156}}</ref> he married his secretary and mistress, [[Frances Stevenson]]. He had first met Stevenson in 1910, and she had worked for him first as a teacher for Megan in 1911;<ref>{{harvnb | Longford | 1996 | p=1}}</ref> their affair began in early 1913.<ref>{{harvnb | Longford | 1996 | pp=11–12}}</ref> Lloyd George may well have been the father of Stevenson's daughter Jennifer (1929–2012), born long before they wed.<ref>{{cite web | last=Longford | first=Jennifer | title=Memories of David Lloyd George | url=http://lloydgeorgesociety.org.uk/news/000006/memories_of_david_lloyd_george__by_jennifer_longford.html | date=2007-07-10 | website=lloydgeorgesociety.org.uk | access-date=2010-10-05 }}</ref> Frances was the first Countess Lloyd-George, and is now largely remembered for her diaries, which dealt with the great issues, and statesmen, of Lloyd George's heyday. A volume of their letters, ''My Darling Pussy'', has also been published; Lloyd George's nickname for Frances referred to her gentle personality.<ref>{{harvnb | Longford | 1996 | pp=12}}</ref>

===Descendants===
The Canadian historian [[Margaret MacMillan]], who detailed Lloyd George's role at the 1919 Peace Conference in her book, ''[[Peacemakers: The Paris Peace Conference of 1919 and Its Attempt to End War|Paris 1919]]'', is his great-granddaughter. The British television historian and presenter [[Dan Snow]] is a great-great-grandson.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/dan-snow-history-boy-876350.html | title=Dan Snow: History boy - Profiles - People - The Independent | date=2008-07-26 | work=[[The Independent]] | accessdate=2014-09-02 }}</ref> Other descendants include [[Owen Lloyd George, 3rd Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor|Owen, 3rd Earl Lloyd-George]], his grandson, and the late 3rd Earl's younger son The Hon. Robert Lloyd George (Chairman of Lloyd George Management),<ref>{{cite news | title=Next generation takes charge | newspaper=Financial Times | location=London | date=2007-04-25 }}</ref> brother of David, the 4th and present Earl, who has two sons: Viscount Gwynedd (born 1986), a journalist, and Captain the Hon. Fred Lloyd George, an officer in the Welsh Guards (born 1987).

===Womaniser===
Lloyd George had a considerable reputation as a womaniser, which led to his being nicknamed "the Goat" (coined by Sir [[Robert Chalmers, 1st Baron Chalmers|Robert Chalmers]], [[Permanent Secretary to the Treasury]] from 1911).<ref>{{harvnb | Grigg | 1978 | p=146}}</ref> Kitchener is said to have remarked early in the First World War that he tried to avoid sharing military secrets with the Cabinet, as they would all tell their wives, apart from Lloyd George "who would tell someone else's wife".<ref>{{harvnb | Corrigan | 2003 | p=309}}</ref>
