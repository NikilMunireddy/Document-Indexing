'''Albany''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=Albany.ogg|ˈ|ɔː|l|b|ə|n|iː|}} {{respell|AWL|bə-nee}}) is the [[State capital (United States)|capital]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York]] and the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]]. Roughly {{convert|150|mi|km|sigfig=2}} north of [[New York City]], Albany developed on the west bank of the [[Hudson River]], about {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of its confluence with the [[Mohawk River]]. The population of the City of Albany was 97,856 according to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Albany constitutes the economic and cultural core of the [[Capital District]] of New York State, which comprises the Albany-[[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]]-[[Troy, New York|Troy]], NY [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|Metropolitan Statistical Area]], including the nearby cities and suburbs of [[Troy, New York|Troy]], [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and [[Saratoga Springs, New York|Saratoga Springs]].

<!--Settlement and notable achievements of the city-->
This was the first European settlement in the state, settled by Dutch colonists who built [[Fort Nassau (North River)|Fort Nassau]] for fur trading in 1614 and [[Fort Orange (New Netherland)|Fort Orange]] in 1624. They formed successful relations with both the [[Mahican]] and the [[Mohawk people]]s, two major Native American nations in the region. The [[fur trade]] attracted settlers who founded a village called [[Beverwijck]] near Fort Orange. In 1664 the [[Kingdom of England|English]] took over the Dutch settlements, renaming the city as Albany, in honor of the then [[Duke of Albany]], the future [[James II of England|James II of England and James VII of Scotland]]. The city was officially chartered in 1686 under English rule. It became the capital of New York State in 1797, following the United States gaining independence in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Albany is one of the oldest surviving settlements of the original British [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen colonies]], and the longest continuously chartered city in the United States. Its charter is possibly the longest-running instrument of municipal government in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=fitzpatrick/>

<!--18th-20th century history-->
During the late 18th century and throughout most of the 19th, Albany was a center of trade and transportation. It is located on the north end of the navigable Hudson River, was the original eastern terminus of the [[Erie Canal]] connecting to the [[Great Lakes]], and was home to some of the earliest [[History of rail transport in the United States|railroad systems]] in the world. Albany's main exports at the time were [[beer]], [[lumber]], [[publishing company|published works]], and [[ironwork]]s. Beginning in [[1810 United States Census|1810]], Albany was one of the ten most populous cities in the United States, a distinction that it held until the [[1860 United States Census|1860 census]].

Albany is one of the first cities in the world to have installed public water mains, sewer lines, natural gas lines and electricity, infrastructure and utilities that attracted and supported substantial new industry to the city and surrounding area during the 19th century.

In the 20th century, the city opened one of the first commercial airports in the world, the precursor of today's [[Albany International Airport]]. During the 1920s a powerful [[political machine]] controlled by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] arose in the state capital, connected to politics in New York City as well. It marshalled the power of immigrants and their descendants in both cities.

The city's skyline changed in the 1940s and 1950s with the construction of office towers around the [[Empire State Plaza]] and at the uptown campus of [[SUNY Albany]],{{efn|The [[State University of New York at Albany]] (its official name) is also known locally as the University at Albany, SUNY Albany, UAlbany (especially when talking about athletics), and simply SUNY.|group=Note}} mainly under the direction of [[Governor of New York|Governor]] [[Nelson Rockefeller]]. While Albany experienced a decline in its population due to [[urban sprawl]] and suburbanization, many of its historic neighborhoods were saved from destruction through the policies of [[Mayor of Albany, New York|Mayor]] [[Erastus Corning 2nd]], the longest-serving mayor of any city in the United States. In the early 21st century, Albany has experienced growth in the [[high-technology industry]], with great strides in the [[nanotechnology]] sector.<ref>{{cite news |last=Rulison |first=Larry |url=http://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Made-in-Albany-IBM-reveals-breakthrough-chip-6376816.php |title=Made in Albany: IBM reveals breakthrough chip made at SUNY Poly |newspaper=Albany Times-Union |date=July 10, 2015 |accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Klopott |first=Freeman  |last2=Wang |first2=Xu  |last3=Ring |first3=Niamh |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-27/ibm-intel-to-invest-4-4-billion-in-new-york-state-nanotechnology.html |title=IBM, Intel Start $4.4 Billion in Chip Venture in New York |publisher=Bloomberg |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref>

<!--Current economy, and closing-->
Albany has been a center of [[Higher education in the United States|higher education]] for over a century, with much of the remainder of its economy dependent on state government and [[Health care in the United States|health care]] services. The city has rebounded from the [[Urban decay|urban decline]] of the 1970s and 1980s, with noticeable development taking place in the city's [[Downtown Albany Historic District|downtown]] and midtown neighborhoods. Albany is known for its rich history, commerce, culture, architecture, and institutions of higher education. Albany won the [[All-America City Award]] in both 1991 and 2009.<ref>{{vcite web |title=All America City Awards: AAC Winners by State and City |publisher=National Civic League |year=2010 |accessdate=September 6, 2010 |url=http://ncl.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=130&Itemid=186}}</ref>

Permanent European claims began when Englishman [[Henry Hudson]], exploring for the [[Dutch East India Company]] on the ''[[Half Moon (ship)|Half Moon]]'' ({{Lang-nl|Halve Maen}}), reached the area in 1609, claiming it for the [[United Netherlands]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/274681/Henry-Hudson Henry Hudson].

During and after the Revolutionary War, Albany County saw a great increase in real estate transactions.

Albany has been a center of transportation for much of its history. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Albany saw development of the [[Toll road|turnpike]] and by 1815, Albany was the turnpike center of the state. [[Simeon De Witt]] developed a grid block system in 1794, and renamed streets for [[Streets of Albany, New York|birds and mammals]] that had previously honored British royalty.{{efn|A rough grid pattern was established in 1764, aligning the streets with Clinton Avenue, which marked the northern border of Albany at the time. [[Patroon]] of the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck]] Stephen Van Rensselaer II followed the same directional system north of Clinton Avenue on his lands; however, the two systems were not related otherwise, which is why cross streets north and south of Clinton Avenue do not align. The stockade surrounding the city was taken down shortly before the Revolutionary War, allowing for expansion. De Witt, city surveyor at the time, continued the grid pattern to the west and renamed on his 1794 map any streets that had honored British Royalty. Hawk Street is the only road that retained its original name; the rest were renamed after birds and mammals.<ref name=waite185>Waite (1993), p. 185</ref><ref name=mceneny68>McEneny (2006), p. 68</ref>|group=Note}} This grid was intersected by the major arterials coming out of Albany, which cut through the city at unexpected angles.<ref name=mceneny75>McEneny (2006), p. 75</ref><ref name=waite201>Waite (1993), p. 201</ref> The construction of the turnpike across the state, in conjunction with canal and railroad systems, made Albany the hub of transportation for pioneers going to [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and the [[Michigan Territory]] in the early- and mid-19th century.<ref name=mceneny75/><ref name=britannica>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/12570/Albany Albany].

While the key to Albany's economic prosperity in the 19th century was transportation, industry and business also played a role. Largely thanks to the city's Dutch and German roots, beer was one of its biggest commodities. [[Beverwyck Brewery]], originally known as Quinn and Nolan ([[Michael N.

Albany opened one of the first commercial airports in the world, and the first municipal airport in the United States, in 1908.

The Albany Municipal Airport—jointly owned by the city and county—was moved to its current location in [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] in 1928. In 1960, the mayor sold the city's stake in the airport to the county, citing budget issues.

[[Erastus Corning 2nd]], arguably Albany's most notable mayor (and great-grandson of the former mayor of the same name), was elected in 1941.<ref name=mceneny157>McEneny (2006), p. 157</ref> Although he was one of the longest-serving mayors of any city in United States history (1942 until his death in 1983), one historian describes Corning's tenure as "long on years, short on accomplishments."<ref name=grondahl490>Grondahl (2007), p. 490</ref> Grondahl cited Corning's preference for maintaining the status quo as a factor that held back potential progress during his tenure.<ref name=grondahl500>Grondahl (2007), p. 500</ref> While Corning brought stability to the office of mayor, it is said that even those who admire him greatly cannot come up with a sizable list of "major concrete Corning achievements."<ref name=grondahl494>Grondahl (2007), p. 494</ref> Corning is given credit for saving—albeit somewhat unintentionally—much of Albany's historic architecture.{{efn|Grondahl summarizes it as, "This hard-line position of isolationism on the part of the [[political machine|machine]] was a curse economically – but a strange blessing unintentionally in architectural terms. While downtown went to seed and plans for large-scale construction and improvements came to a virtual standstill in Albany without federal money, pockets of the city's historic housing stock escaped the wrecking ball."<ref name=grondahl500/>|group=Note}}

During the 1950s and 1960s, a time when federal aid for urban renewal was plentiful,<ref name=grondahl500/> Albany did not have growth in its economy or infrastructure. It lost more than 20 percent of its population during the Corning years, as people moved to newer housing in the suburbs, followed by most of the downtown businesses [[Urban sprawl|moving there as well]].<ref name=grondahl492>Grondahl (2007), p. 492</ref> While cities across the country grappled with similar issues, the problems were magnified in Albany: interference from the Democratic political machine hindered progress considerably.<ref name=grondahl500/>

Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] (1959–1973) ([[United States Republican Party|R]]) tried to stimulate the city with grandiose, monumental architecture and large, government-sponsored building projects; he drove construction of the [[Empire State Plaza]], [[SUNY Albany]]'s uptown campus, and much of the [[W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus]].<ref name=grondahl501>Grondahl (2007), p. 501</ref> Albany County [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Chairman Joseph C. Frangella once quipped, "Governor Rockefeller was the best mayor Albany ever had."<ref name=grondahl502>Grondahl (2007), p. 502</ref> Corning, though opposed to the project, was responsible for negotiating the payment plan for the Empire State Plaza. Rockefeller did not want to be limited by the Legislature's [[power of the purse]], so Corning devised a plan to have the county pay for the construction and have the state sign a lease-ownership agreement. The state paid off the bonds until 2004. It was Rockefeller's only viable option, and he agreed. Due to the clout Corning gained from the situation, he was able to get the State Museum, a convention center, and a restaurant, back in the plans—ideas which Rockefeller had originally vetoed. The county gained $35 million in fees and the city received $13 million for lost tax revenue. Having the state offices located in the city enabled it to keep good jobs.<ref name=grondahl467469>Grondahl (2007), pp. 467–469</ref>

[[File:Albany Yellow Book cropped.jpeg|thumb|This 1955 map shows the planned expansion of the [[Interstate Highway System]] around Albany.|alt=Black and white map shows the boundaries of Albany and surrounding municipalities, crossed with dark black lines representing planned interstate highways.]]

Another major project of the 1960s and 1970s was [[Interstate 787]] and the [[South Mall Arterial]].{{efn|The Empire State Plaza was originally known as the South Mall; the [[South Mall Arterial]] is the only remnant of that naming scheme.|group=Note}} Construction began in the early 1960s. One of the project's main results, since regretted, was separating the city from the Hudson River, its source of development. Corning has been described as shortsighted with respect to use of the waterfront, as he could have used his influence to change the location of I-787, which now cuts the city off from "its whole ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]''".<ref name=grondahl498>Grondahl (2007), p. 498</ref> Much of the original plan never came to fruition, however: Rockefeller had wanted the South Mall Arterial to pass through the Empire State Plaza.

When Corning died in 1983, [[Thomas Michael Whalen III|Thomas Whalen]] assumed the mayorship and was reelected twice.

Prior to the [[Early 1990s recession|recession of the 1990s]], downtown Albany was home to four [[Fortune 500]] companies.<ref name=mceneny193>McEneny (2006), p. 193</ref> After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman [[Sam Stratton]], the political environment changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led to a lack of interest in city politics.<ref name=mceneny193194>McEneny (2006), pp. 193–194</ref> The election of [[Gerald Jennings]] was a surprise, and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had been in place since the 1920s.<ref name=mceneny198>McEneny (2006), p. 198</ref>

During the 1990s, the State Legislature approved the $234 million "Albany Plan", "a building and renovation project [that] was the most ambitious building project to affect the area since the Rockefeller era." Under the Albany Plan, renovation and new building projects were initiated around the downtown area. Many state workers were relocated from the Harriman State Office Campus to downtown, helping its retail businesses and vitality.<ref name=mceneny201>McEneny (2006), p. 201</ref> During the first decade of the 21st century, progress was made on a long-discussed and controversial [[Albany Convention Center]].

Albany's neighborhoods are varied demographically, geographically, architecturally, and historically. [[Downtown Albany Historic District|Downtown Albany]] is the city's oldest neighborhood, centered on State Street, one of Albany's oldest streets and its original [[main street]].

The most recognizable aspect of the complex is the [[Erastus Corning Tower]], the [[List of tallest buildings in Upstate New York|tallest building in New York outside of New York City]].<ref name=waite8182/> Juxtaposed at the north end of the Plaza is the 19th-century [[New York State Capitol]], the seat of the [[New York State Legislature]] and the home of the [[Governor of New York|Governor's office]].<ref name=waite6870>Waite (1993), pp. 68–70</ref>

Architecture from the 1960s and 1970s is well represented in the city, especially at the [[W.

Historically, Albany's population has been mixed. First dominated by the Dutch and Germans, it was overtaken by the English in the early 19th century. Irish immigrants soon outnumbered most other ethnicities by the mid-19th century, and were followed by Italians and [[Poles]]. The mid-to-late 20th century saw a rise in the African-American population. As historian (and Albany Assemblyman) John McEneny puts it, 
<blockquote>Dutch and Yankee, German and Irish, Polish and Italian, black and Chinese—over the centuries Albany's heritage has reflected a succession of immigrant nationalities. Its streets have echoed with a dozen languages, its neighborhoods adapting to the distinctive life-style and changing economic fortunes of each new group.<ref name=mceneny102>McEneny (2006), p. 102</ref></blockquote>

Until after the Revolution, Albany's population consisted mostly of ethnic Dutch descendants. Settlers moving in from New England tipped the balance toward British ethnicity in the early 19th century.<ref name=mceneny103>McEneny (2006), p. 103</ref> Jobs on the turnpikes, canals, and railroads brought in floods of [[Irish American|Irish immigrants]] in the early 19th century, especially in the 1840s during the [[Irish potato famine]], solidifying the city's Irish base. Albany elected its first [[Irish Catholic]] mayor ([[Michael N. Nolan|Michael Nolan]]) two years before Boston did.<ref name=mceneny104>McEneny (2006), p. 104</ref> [[Polish American|Polish]] and [[Italian American|Italian]] immigrants began arriving in Albany in the wave of immigration in the latter part of the 19th century. Their numbers were smaller than in many other eastern cities mainly because most had found manufacturing jobs at [[General Electric]] in Schenectady.<ref name=mceneny107>McEneny (2006), p. 107</ref> The Jewish community, with Sephardic Jewish members part of the Beverwijck community, also saw a rise in population during the late 19th century, when many Ashkenazi Jews immigrated from eastern Europe.<ref name=mceneny107/> In that period, there was also an influx of [[Chinese American|Chinese]] and east Asian immigrants, who settled in the downtown section of the city. Many of their descendants have since moved to suburban areas.<ref name=mceneny108>McEneny (2006), p. 108</ref> Immigration all but halted after the [[Immigration Act of 1924]]. Albany was also a destination of internal migration, as many African Americans moved north in their [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the rural South before and after [[World War I]] to fill industrial positions. As a percentage, the black community has grown substantially since then: African Americans made up 3 percent of the population in 1950, 6 percent in 1960, 12 percent in 1970, and 30 percent in 2010. The change in proportion is related mostly to middle-class white families moving to the suburbs, and black families remaining within city limits during the same time period.<ref name=mceneny111>McEneny (2006), p. 111</ref><ref name="GR2" />

Since 2007 there has been an ever growing number of [[Myanmar|Burmese]] refugees, mostly of the [[Karen people|Karen]] ethnicity, with an estimate 5,000 now residing in Albany.<ref>{{cite news |last=McKibben |first=Matthew |title=Albany's Karen community celebrates New Year |url=http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2015/jan/12/karen-new-year/?print |publisher=[[The Daily Gazette]] |date=12 January 2015 |accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Grondahl |first=Paul |title=They nail the American Dream |url=http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/They-nail-the-American-Dream-4340962.php |publisher=[[Times Union (Albany)]] |date=9 March 2013 |accessdate=23 November 2015}}</ref>

Albany has a [[Mayor–council government|mayor-council form of government]], which currently functions under a charter adopted in 1998. The 1998 charter completely overwrote the original 17th-century ''[[Dongan Charter]]''. However, in an effort to keep ''Dongan'' in effect, the new charter was applied strictly as an amendment to ''Dongan'', meaning ''Dongan'' is technically still in effect, giving Albany the distinction of having the oldest active city charter in the United States and "arguably the longest-running instrument of municipal government in the [[Western Hemisphere]]."<ref name=fitzpatrick/><ref name=charter/> The [[List of mayors of Albany, New York|mayor]], who is elected every four years, heads the [[Executive (government)|executive branch]] of city government.<ref name=Charter2>{{vcite web |title=The Charter |author=City of Albany |date=November 3, 1998 |accessdate=June 19, 2010 |url=http://www.ecode360.com/ecode3-back/getSimple.jsp?custId=AL0934&guid=12064948}}</ref> The current mayor, [[Kathy Sheehan]], was first elected in 2013.

While Albany has its own city government, it has also been the seat of Albany County since the county's formation in 1683 and the capital of New York since 1797. As such, the city is home to all branches of the county and state governments, as well as its own. [[Albany City Hall]] sits on Eagle Street, opposite the State Capitol,<ref name=cityhall>{{vcite web |title=Welcome to City Hall |publisher=City of Albany, New York |url=http://www.albanyny.org/Government/CityHistory/CityHall.aspx |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> and the Albany County Office Building is on State Street.<ref>{{vcite web |title=Departments and Offices |publisher=County of Albany, New York |url=http://www.albanycounty.com/departmentlist.asp |accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> The state government has offices scattered throughout the city.

===Politics===
Albany's politics have been dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] since the 1920s; [[Daniel P. O'Connell|Daniel (Uncle Dan) O'Connell]] established a [[political machine]] in the city with the election of William Stormont Hackett as mayor in 1922.<ref name =grondahl48>Grondahl (2007), p. 48</ref> Prior to that, William (Billy) Barnes had set up a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] machine in the 1890s. Barnes' success is attributed to the fact that he owned two newspapers in Albany and that he was the grandson of [[Thurlow Weed]], the influential newspaper publisher and political boss.<ref name=grondahl165>Grondahl (2007), p. 165</ref> O'Connell's organization overcame Barnes' in 1922 and survived well into the 1980s (even after his death), as the machine put forth candidates for whom the electorate dutifully voted. In many instances, votes were outright bought;<ref name=grondahl458>Grondahl (2007), p. 458</ref> it was not uncommon for the machine to "buy poor folks' loyalty and trust with a [[United States five-dollar bill|fiver]]".<ref>Grondahl (2007), p. 460</ref>

Gerald Jennings' upset in the 1993 Democratic mayoral [[Primary election|primary]] over Harold Joyce, who had the Democratic Party's formal endorsement and had only recently been its county chairman, is often cited as the end of the O'Connell era in Albany.<ref>{{vcite news |title=As Joyce Goes Down in Defeat, So Does the Machine |author=Jochnowitz, Jay |date=September 15, 1993 |page=A1 |work=Times Union (Albany) |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=5690985 |accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref> Albany continues to be dominated by the Democratic party as enrollment in the city was 38,862 in 2009 compared to Republican enrollment of 3,487.<ref>{{vcite news |title=Albany contenders |author=O'Brien, Tim |work=Times Union (Albany) |publisher=Hearst Newspapers |date=January 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |url=http://albarchive.merlinone.net/mweb/wmsql.wm.request?oneimage&imageid=7354525}}</ref> This gives Democrats a 10–1 advantage in the general election.

Exact numbers on religious denominations in Albany are not readily available.

==Sister cities==
Albany has five official [[sister city]] agreements and two other [[Twin towns and sister cities|twin-city]] relationships. The city of [[Nijmegen, Netherlands]] connected with Albany following [[World War II]]. With the help of the Catholic university in Albany, the Catholic University of Nijmegen ([[Radboud University Nijmegen]]) rebuilt its partly destroyed library, with over 50,000 books being donated to the Dutch university. To show its gratitude for post-war assistance, the city sent Albany 50,000 [[tulip bulb]]s in 1948; this act led to the establishment of the annual Tulip Festival.<ref name=mceneny192 /> Most of the other connections were made in the 1980s during Mayor Whalen's term in office as part of his cultural expansion program.<ref name=mceneny192/> The official sister cities are:<ref name=sisters>{{vcite web |title=Sister City US Listings |publisher=Sister Cities International |url=http://www.sister-cities.org/directory/index.cfm |accessdate=April 25, 2010}} ''Note: Permalinking to search results is not possible.
