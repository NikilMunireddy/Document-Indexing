Hantuchová reached her first semifinal of the year at her fourth event in Antwerp, losing to Williams again, 1–6, 4–6. By then, Hantuchová's ranking was at a career-high no. 5. Defending a title for the first time in her career, Hantuchová advanced to the fourth round in Indian Wells, losing to [[Amanda Coetzer]], 4–6, 4–6. Despite a first round-loss to [[Alicia Molik]] in Miami, Hantuchová rebounded in the Tier I Charleston event, making her fifth quarterfinal in seven events, losing to [[Ashley Harkleroad]], 2–6, 1–6. She made her sixth quarterfinal at her next event in [[Amelia Island]], losing to eventual champion Dementieva, 0–6, 1–6. Hantuchová went undefeated in first-round Fed Cup play against Germany, winning both of her matches. Following the Fed Cup, she again made it to the quarterfinals for the seventh time of the year at the Tier I Berlin tournament, losing to [[Kim Clijsters]], 0–6, 3–6.

At the French Open, Hantuchová lost in the second round in a marathon match to Harkleroad again, 6–7(2), 6–4, 7–9, making 101 unforced errors, leading to long-time coach [[Nigel Sears]] criticising her attitude publicly.<ref>theage.com.au [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/29/1056825268466.html A towering talent]</ref> Following the match, her extremely thin physique was noticed for the first time publicly, and some wondered about Hantuchová's health. Kicking off the grass season in Eastbourne, Hantuchová lost in the quarterfinals to [[Conchita Martínez]], but more famously she lost in the second round of Wimbledon to [[Shinobu Asagoe]], 6–0, 4–6, 10–12, with Hantuchová breaking down crying during the latter stages of the match and making 57 unforced errors. Some theorized that the media's continued interest regarding her weight and the pressure of success at 19 years of age, in addition to her on-court breakdown and her parents' divorce, as well as her coach's walked out during the middle of the match, led to this breakdown. Following Wimbledon, Hantuchová went 6–8 for the rest of the year, 0–4 against top-10 players She ended the year with an overall record of 28–23, and she fell to no. 17 in the world. Further signs of the pressure and problems she was facing during this period was that, in July, she made herself unavailable for Slovakia in the Fed Cup, in order to concentrate on her singles career, and in November she parted company with Sears.<ref>news.bbc.co.uk – [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/3245989.stm ''Hantuchová splits with coach'']</ref>

===2004===
2004 proved to be a continuation of Hantuchová's poor second half of 2003, with many of the same struggles (she briefly hired Harold Soloman, who had previously coached her friend [[Jennifer Capriati]] as well as [[Anna Kournikova]], before re-hiring Sears in March),<ref>rediff.com – [http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/mar/10tennis.htm ''Hantuchová rehires Sears'']</ref> She reached just three quarterfinals, the first at the first Tier I event in Tokyo was not until halfway through the season. At Tokyo, however, she garnered her thus far only victory over [[Maria Sharapova]] in the second round, falling to Davenport, 2–6, 2–6, in the quarterfinals. The tournament that saved her from a poor 2004 was Eastbourne, in which she defeated [[Ai Sugiyama]] in the quarterfinals, 6–1 7–6(7), and [[Amélie Mauresmo]] in the semifinals, 4–6, 6–4, 6–4, before losing to [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]] in the third final of her career, 6–2, 6–7(2), 4–6. However, Hantuchová was serving for the championship, up 6–2, 6–5, but was broken.

[[File:Daniela-practice court 0512.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Hantuchová practicing during the Australian Open in 2005]]

[[File:Daniela Hantuchova Zurich Open 2006.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Hantuchová at the [[Zurich Open]] in 2006]]

Hantuchová lost to eventual quarterfinalist [[Venus Williams]] in the third round at the US Open. She won the mixed doubles, completing a career grand slam in mixed doubles. She has largely retired from the mixed doubles since then, saying that she "felt like it's time to move on and focus on my singles."<ref name=asapinterview>{{cite news|url=http://www.asapsports.com/show_interview.php?id=47265|title=Daniela Hantuchova|work=The Telegraph|date=23 January 2008|accessdate=17 June 2013}}</ref> In Luxembourg, Hantuchová made her eighth quarterfinal of the season, losing to [[Nathalie Dechy]], 1–6, 4–6.

===2006===
Hantuchová reached the quarterfinals of Sydney in 2006 with a win over top-10 player [[Patty Schnyder]] and got to the semifinals of Auckland. She continued this form at the Australian Open with her third-round 6–1, 7–6(5) victory over defending champion and seven-time Grand Slam winner [[Serena Williams]], who had entered the tournament with a lack of match practice and questions over her fitness. This victory (the only over Serena in her career) ensured that Hantuchová would progress to the fourth round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in three years. She lost to fourth-seeded [[Maria Sharapova]] in straight sets in the fourth round.

[[File:Daniela Hantuchova with Ai Sugyiama at Roland Garros 2006.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Hantuchová with doubles partner [[Ai Sugiyama]] at the French Open in 2006]]

Thereafter, she was unable to find a consistent level of form. Prior to the clay-court season, she parted company for a second time (and permanently) with Sears.<ref>news.bbc.co.uk – [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/4941978.stm ''Hantuchová parts with coach again'']</ref> He was replaced by Angel Giminez. She then played her first Fed Cup matches for Slovakia in almost three years. It was a successful return, with Hantuchová winning both her singles and her doubles matches against [[Luxembourg]], her singles match against The Netherlands, and the decisive singles rubber in the tie against Great Britain. With the help of Hantuchová's 4–0 record, Slovakia booked a place in the World Group II play-off against [[Thailand]].

Despite disappointing results in the warm-up tournaments, she reached the fourth round of both the French Open and Wimbledon, before extending her 2006 Fed Cup record to 6–0 by winning both her singles matches in Slovakia's 5–0 rout of Thailand, which ensured their promotion to the World Group II. Her fourth-round streak at Grand Slams ended when she was beaten by a resurgent [[Serena Williams]] in the second round of the US Open, which was the culmination of a very disappointing American hard-court season (her record was 7–6 including the US Open, failing to get past the round of 16 of any of the tournaments she entered).

Hantuchová beat [[Tatiana Golovin]] in straight sets, before losing to [[Dinara Safina]]. The following week, she reached the quarterfinals of Stuttgart with an easy victory over the then top-10 player Safina in the second round. This was both her first victory over a top-10 player and first appearance in a quarterfinal since January. In October 2006, Hantuchová reached the final of the Zurich Open. In the first round, she upset sixth seed [[Patty Schnyder]]. In the second round, she defeated her doubles partner [[Ai Sugiyama]]. Hantuchová was then scheduled to play world no. 1 [[Amélie Mauresmo]] in the quarterfinals. However, Mauresmo withdrew due to a right shoulder injury. In the semifinals, Hantuchová upset world no. 4 [[Svetlana Kuznetsova]], 6–4, 6–2, to reach the final of the Tier I event. In the final, Hantuchová lost in a tight three-setter to second seed [[Maria Sharapova]], 1–6, 6–4, 3–6. The results in this tournament were the culmination of Hantuchová's up-turn of form, which kept her in the top 20, as she had arrived in Zurich outside the top group for the first time in over 11 months. The injury she suffered to her right rib<ref name="TVNZ_866503">{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411317/866503 |title=Hantuchova through to final |date=22 October 2006 |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=27 September 2011}}</ref> after Mary Pierce hit a shot at her in doubles, caused her the most serious injury of her career and also forced her to retire in her match against Vesnina the following week in Linz. Hantuchová finished the year ranked no. 17 in the world, with a 34–25 record. She went 24–17 on hard courts, 5–4 on clay, 3–2 on grass, and 2–2 on carpet.

==Endorsements==

===Product endorsement and equipment===
Until the 2009 [[2009 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Hantuchová endorsed [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] sportswear and had her own line with them for her tournament wear, like players such as [[Maria Sharapova]] and [[Serena Williams]]. From the 2009 [[2009 US Open (tennis)|US Open]] onwards, Hantuchová began endorsing [[Adidas]] sportswear. As of Wimbledon 2010, she shares the same signature line as [[Ana Ivanovic]]. In 2006, Hantuchová also appeared on an advertisement for Sony Ericsson Cyber-shot phone with Ivanovic.

Hantuchová also has endorsed four racquet brands. She first endorsed [[Babolat]] from the time she was a junior until late 2003, then [[Yonex]] until the 2007 Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, when she started using the [[Prince Sports|Prince]] Ozone Seven Racquets in the 2007 [[Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships]]. Photos were released from Prince giving the impression that Hantuchová, from the start of the 2011 season, will be using the Prince EXO3 Tour 100. However, she signed a deal with Volkl Tennis and then used the Volkl Power Bridge 9. Starting with the [[2011 Fed Cup]], she began using the Prince EXO3 Tour Team 100 again, with which she won her fourth career title. In spring of 2015, Hantuchová started using [[HEAD]] rackets and bags although the racket is not part of the current range and appears to be all black in color. During the 2015 Grass Court Season to now, Hantuchová started using the HEAD Graphene Instinct MP racket.

===Video games===
Hantuchová has been in many sports/tennis related video games with such players as [[Maria Sharapova]], [[Lindsay Davenport]], [[Venus Williams]] and [[Anna Kournikova]]. Some of the titles are [[Top Spin (video game)|Top Spin]] (both [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[PlayStation 2]] versions), [[Smash Court Tennis Pro Tournament 2]], Roland Garros 2005 and [[Virtua Tennis 3]]. Hantuchová is currently ranked third behind [[Serena Williams]] and [[Ana Ivanovic]] in a poll for new downloadable players for [[Top Spin 3]]. Hantuchová is also a playable character in [[Virtua Tennis 2009]].
