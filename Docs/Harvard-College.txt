[[File:HarvardYard.jpg|thumb|300px|View of freshman dormitories in [[Harvard Yard]]]]

The "New College" came into existence in 1636 by vote of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Great and General Court]] (colonial legislature, second oldest in British America) of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]—though without a single building, instructor, or student. In 1638, the college became home for North America's first known printing press, carried by the ship ''[[John of London (ship)|John of London]]''.<ref name="FirstPrintingPress">{{cite web|title=The instrument behind New England’s first literary flowering|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/03/harvard’s-first-impressions/|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref><ref name="UHullMHSC">{{cite web|title=Rowley and Ezekiel Rogers, The First North American Printing Press|url=http://www.hull.ac.uk/mhsc/FarHorizons/Documents/EzekielRogers.pdf|publisher=Maritime Historical Studies Centre, University of Hull|accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref> Three years later the college was renamed in honor of deceased [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]] minister [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] (1607–1638) who had bequeathed to the school his entire library and half of his monetary estate.

Harvard's first instructor, schoolmaster [[Nathaniel Eaton]] (1610–1674), was also its first instructor to be dismissed—in 1639, for overstrict discipline.<ref name="Samuel Eliot Morison 1986">Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Three Centuries of Harvard, 1636–1936'' (1986)</ref> The school's first students were graduated in 1642.

At the time of Harvard's founding (as today) the ''"colleges"'' of England's [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] Universities were communities within the larger university, each an association of scholars (both established and aspiring) sharing room and board;<!--whatever that means -- sounds grand though, don't it?-->
Harvard's founders may<!--{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}--> have envisioned it as the first in a series of sibling colleges which, on the English model, would eventually constitute a university.  Though no further "colleges" materialized in colonial times, nonetheless as Harvard began granting higher degrees in the late eighteenth century<!--{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}--> it was increasingly styled<!--{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}--> Harvard ''University''—even as Harvard ''College'' (in keeping with emerging American usage of that word)<!--{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}--> was increasingly thought of as the university's undergraduate division in particular.{{Fix|text=citations needed throughout}}

Though the [[Indian College]] was active from 1640 to no later than 1693, it was a minor addition not operated in federation with Harvard according to the English model.

Today Harvard College is responsible for undergraduate admissions, advising, housing, student life, and athletics{{snd}}generally all undergraduate matters except instruction, which is the purview of Harvard University's [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences|Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]. The body known as ''[[President and Fellows of Harvard College|The President and Fellows of Harvard College]]'' retains its traditional name despite having governance of the entire University. ([[Radcliffe College]], established 1879,<ref>{{cite book |first=Sally |last=Schwager |chapter=Taking up the Challenge: The Origins of Radcliffe |title=Yards and Gates: Gender in Harvard and Radcliffe History |editor=Laurel Thatcher Ulrich (ed.) |location=New York |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2004 |isbn=1-4039-6098-4 |pages=87–115}}</ref> originally paid Harvard faculty to repeat their lectures for women students.
Since the 1970s, Harvard has been responsible for the above-listed matters for women, though women were still formally admitted to and graduated from Radcliffe until a final merger in 1999.)<ref>{{cite report |title=Radcliffe Enters Historic Merger With Harvard |publisher= |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/4/21/radcliffe-enters-historic-merger-with-harvard |accessdate=May 6, 2016}}</ref>

==Academics==
About 2,000 students are admitted each year, representing between five and ten percent of those applying; of those admitted approximately three-quarters choose to attend.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Daphne|title=Harvard Accepts Record-Low 5.3 Percent of Applicants to Class of 2019|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/4/1/regular-admissions-class-2019///|accessdate=10 August 2015|newspaper=The Harvard Crimson|date=1 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Jan|first=Tracy|title=Harvard admission rate dips to 7 percent|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2009/03/harvard_admissi.html|accessdate=13 April 2011|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=30 March 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=528168 Yield Holds Steady For 2013] – Harvard News Office</ref><ref>[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2008/04.03/99-admissions.html A record pool leads to a record-low admissions rate] – Harvard News Office</ref> These figures make Harvard perhaps the most selective and sought-after college in the world. Very few transfers are accepted.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menz|first1=Petey|title=The Real 1%: Harvard Admits 15 Transfer Students|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/6/21/transfer-admissions-one-percent/|work=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|accessdate=7 March 2015}}</ref>

Midway through the second year, most undergraduates join one of fifty standard ''fields of concentration'' (what most schools call [[academic major]]s); many also declare a ''secondary field'' (called ''minors'' elsewhere).  ''Joint'' concentrations (combining the requirements of two standard concentrations) and ''special'' concentrations (of the student's own design) are also possible.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}<!--various cites are needed throughout, likely from http://handbook.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k79903&pageid=icb.page418760 and so on -->

Most Harvard College concentrations lead to the ''Artium Baccalaureus'' (A.B.), normally completed in four years, though students leaving high school with substantial college-level coursework may finish in three. A smaller number receive the ''Scientiarum Baccalaureus'' (S.B.), normally requiring five years. There are also special degree programs, such as a five-year program leading to both a Harvard undergraduate degree and a Master of Arts from the [[New England Conservatory of Music]].

Undergraduates must also fulfill the General Education requirement of coursework in eight designated fields:
{|
|
* Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding
* Culture and Belief
* Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning
|
* Ethical Reasoning
* Science of Living Systems
* Science of the Physical Universe
|
* Societies of the World
* United States in the World
<!--dummy linebreaks to make table line up -->
|}

Each student's exposure (via "Gen Ed") to a range of intellectual areas, while pursuing a chosen concentration in depth, fulfills the injunction of Harvard past-president [[Abbott Lawrence Lowell]] that liberal education should produce "men who know a little of everything and something well."{{refn|{{cite book|first=Harry R.|last=Lewis|title=Excellence Without a Soul: Does Liberal Education Have a Future?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vnSP2RMjMgC&pg=PA48|year=2007|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-537-5|pages=48}}}}

{{anchor|House system}}<!-- this anchor is referenced at [[Memorial Hall (Harvard University)]]-->
==House system==<!-- This section is linked from [[Harvard University]] and articles in individual houses-->
[[File:Lowell House belltower.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Lowell House in autumn]]
Nearly all undergraduates live on campus, for the first year in dormitories in or near [[Harvard Yard]] (see [[List of Harvard dormitories]]) and later in the upperclass ''Houses''&mdash;administrative subdivisions of the College as well as living quarters, providing a sense of community in what might otherwise be a socially incohesive and administratively daunting university environment. Each house is presided over by a senior-faculty ''Master,'' while its ''[[Allston Burr Resident Dean]]'' (usually a junior faculty member) supervises undergraduates' day-to-day academic and disciplinary well-being. The Master and Resident Dean are assisted by other members of the ''[[Senior Common Room]]''&mdash;select graduate students (called ''tutors''), faculty, and University officials brought into voluntary association with each house.  Many tutors reside in the House, as do the Master and Resident Dean. (Terms such as tutor, Senior Common Room and ''[[Junior Common Room]]''&mdash;the House's undergraduate members&mdash;reflect a debt to the [[residential colleges|residential college]] systems at Oxford and Cambridge from which Harvard's system took inspiration.)<ref name="Harvard College ResLife 2008">{{cite web | author = Harvard College Office of Residential Life  | title = History of the House System  | year = 2008   | url = http://www.orl.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k11447&tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup17718   | accessdate = 2008-04-20 }}</ref>

The Houses were created by President Lowell in the 1930s to combat what he saw as pernicious social stratification engendered by the private, off-campus living arrangements of many undergraduates at that time. Lowell's solution was to provide every man{{mdashb}}Harvard was male-only at the time{{mdashb}}with on-campus accommodations throughout his time at the College; Lowell also saw great benefits flowing from other features of the House system, such as the relaxed discussions (academic or otherwise) which he hoped would take place among undergraduates and members of the Senior Common Room over meals in each House's dining hall.<ref>
{{cite book | author = Morison, Samuel Eliot |title = Three Centuries of Harvard: 1636&ndash;1936 | year = 1936 |pages = 476&ndash;478}}</ref>

The way in which students come to live in particular Houses has changed greatly over time. Under the original "draft" system, Masters negotiated privately over the assignment of "rising sophomores" (that is, current freshmen, who will be sophomores in the coming academic year) considered most&mdash;or least&mdash;promising.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}
From the 1960s to the mid-1990s, each student ranked the Houses according to personal preference, with an impersonal lottery resolving the oversubscription of more popular houses. Today, groups of one to eight freshmen form a block which is then assigned, essentially at random, to an upperclass house.

[[File:River houses Harvard aerial.JPG|thumb|upright=1.85|The "River" Houses. [[Harvard Yard]] at top center.]]

The construction of the River houses was financed largely by a 1928 gift from [[Yale]] alumnus [[Edward Harkness]] who, frustrated in his attempts to initiate a similar project at his alma mater, eventually offered 11 million dollars to Harvard.{{efn|
<ref name="bethell" /><ref name="gifts28-29">"Gifts - 1928-1929" (Press release). Harvard University News Office. June 20, 1929. HU 37.5, Harvard University Archives, Cambridge, Mass. "This figure [of gifts and legacies received during the year] includes $5,444,000 received from E. S. Harkness to defray the expenses of constructing the first Harvard houses."</ref>
Harkness' gift was anonymous, at least at first. "I have forgotten the gentleman's name," Harvard's President Lowell told the faculty in making the initial announcement. "I told him I would."{{refn|{{cite book|title=The Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University, 1686{{ndash}}1933|author=John B. Fox, Jr.|year=2007|p=142|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College}} }}

Two of the new houses, Dunster and Lowell, were completed in 1930.<ref name="bethell" /> <!--need something about later construction -- Mather, Quincy, Leverett -->

After graduating Harvard in 1895, Edward Waldo Forbes (grandson of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]) found himself inspired by the Oxford and Cambridge systems during two years of study in England; on returning to the United States he set out to acquire such land between Harvard Yard and the Charles River as was not already owned by Harvard or some associated entity. By 1918 that ambition had been largely fulfilled and the assembled land transferred to Harvard.<ref>Lowe, Charles U.

The three ''Quad Houses'' (in the [[Quadrangle (Harvard)|Radcliffe Quadrangle]]) enjoy a residential setting one-half mile (800 m) northwest of Harvard Yard. These were built by [[Radcliffe College]] and housed [[Radcliffe College]] students until the Harvard and Radcliffe residential systems merged in 1977.<ref>Sofen, Adam A. "Radcliffe Enters Historic Merger With Harvard, April 21, 1999.[http://www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article/1999/4/21/radcliffe-enters-historic-merger-with-harvard/]</ref> They are:

A thirteenth house, [[Dudley House (Harvard College)|Dudley House]], is nonresidential but fulfills, for some graduate students and the (very few) undergraduates living off campus, the administrative and social functions provided on-campus residents by the other twelve houses.

Harvard's residential houses are paired with Yale's residential colleges in [[Harvard-Yale sister colleges|sister relationships]].

== Athletics ==
{{main|Harvard Crimson}}
By the late 19th century critics of intercollegiate athletics, including Harvard president [[Charles William Eliot]], believed that sports competition had become over-commercialized and took students away from their studies, and they called for reform and limitations on all sports. This opposition prompted Harvard's athletic committee to target 'minor' sports—basketball and hockey—for reform and regulation in order to deflect attention from the major sports—football, baseball, track, and crew. The committee made it difficult for the basketball team to operate by denying financial assistance and limiting the number of overnight away games in which the team could participate. Several losing seasons, negative attitudes toward the commercialization of intercollegiate sports, and the need for reform contributed to basketball's demise at Harvard in 1909.<ref>Marc  Horger,  "A Victim of Reform: Why Basketball Failed at Harvard, 1900-1909," ''New England Quarterly'' 2005 78(1): 49-76,</ref>

Today Harvard, one of the eight members of the [[Ivy League]], claims{{clarify|date=October 2012}} to have the largest Division I intercollegiate athletics program, with 41 varsity teams and over 1,500 student-athletes.

Begun in 1852 the [[Harvard-Yale Regatta]] is the oldest intercollegiate athletic rivalry in the United States.
Better known is the [[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|annual Harvard-Yale football game]]&mdash;"The Game", to insiders&mdash;first played in [[New Haven]], Connecticut, in 1875, and now played on the Saturday before Thanksgiving, making it one of many significant games played on "Rivalry Day."{{clarify|date=October 2012}}
