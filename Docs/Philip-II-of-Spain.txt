''The Grand Strategy of Philip II'', (2000)</ref> He was also [[Duke of Milan]].<ref>Garret Mattingly. ''The Armada'' p. 22, p. 66 ISBN 0-395-08366-4</ref> From 1555, he was lord of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] of the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Netherlands]].

Known in Spain as "Felipe el Prudente" ('"Philip the Prudent'"), his [[Spanish Empire|empire]] included territories on every continent then known to Europeans, including his namesake [[Philippines|the Philippine Islands]]. During his reign, Spain reached the height of its influence and power. This is sometimes called the ''[[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]]''. The expression, "the empire on which the sun never sets," was coined during Philip's time to reflect the extent of his dominion.

During Philip's reign there were separate [[sovereign default|state bankruptcies]] in 1557, 1560, 1569, 1575, and 1596. This was partly the cause for the [[Act of Abjuration|declaration of independence]] which created the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1581. A devout Catholic, Philip is also known for organising a huge naval expedition against Protestant England in 1588, known usually as the [[Spanish Armada]], which was unsuccessful, mostly due to storms and grave logistical problems.

Philip was described by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ambassador Paolo Fagolo in 1563 as "slight of stature and round-faced, with pale blue eyes, [[Habsburg lip|somewhat prominent lip]], and pink skin, but his overall appearance is very attractive." The Ambassador went on to say "He dresses very tastefully, and everything that he does is courteous and gracious."<ref>{{cite book|last=Davis|first=James C.|title=Pursuit of Power: Venetian Ambassadors' Reports on Spain, Turkey, and France in the Age of Philip II 1560–1600|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York|year=1970|pages=81–82}}</ref>

==Early years: 1527–54==
The son of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire]], and his wife, [[Isabella of Portugal|Infanta Isabella of Portugal]], Philip was born in the Spanish capital of [[Valladolid]] on 21 May 1527 at Palacio de Pimentel owned by Don Bernardino Pimentel (the first Marqués de Távara). The culture and courtly life of Spain were an important influence in his early life. He was tutored by Juan Martínez Siliceo – the future [[Archbishop of Toledo]]. Philip displayed reasonable aptitude in arms and letters alike. Later he would study with more illustrious tutors, including the humanist Juan Cristóbal Calvete de Estrella. Philip, though he had good command over [[Latin]], Spanish and Portuguese, never managed to equal his father, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], as a polyglot. Despite being also a German [[archduke]] from the [[House of Habsburg]], Philip was seen as a foreigner in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The feeling was mutual. Philip felt himself to be culturally Spanish; he had been born in Spain and raised in the Castilian court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. This would ultimately impede his succession to the imperial throne.<ref name="JBE">James Boyden; Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopaedia of the Early Modern World.</ref>

In April 1528, when Philip was eleven months old, he received the oath of allegiance as heir to the crown from the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], and from that time until the death of his mother [[Isabella of Portugal|Isabella]] in 1539, Philip was raised in the royal court of Castile under the care of his mother, and one of her [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] ladies, Dona Leonor de Mascarenhas, to whom he was devotedly attached. Philip was also close to his two sisters, [[Maria of Austria, Holy Roman Empress|María]] and [[Joan of Austria, Princess of Portugal|Juana]], and to his two pages, the Portuguese nobleman [[Ruy Gómez de Silva|Rui Gomes da Silva]] and [[Luis de Requesens]], the son of his governor Juan de Zúñiga. These men would serve Philip throughout their lives, as would Antonio Pérez, his secretary from 1541.

Philip's martial training was undertaken by his governor, Juan de Zúñiga, a Castilian nobleman who served as the [[commendador]] mayor of Castile. The practical lessons in warfare was overseen by the [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] during the [[Italian War of 1542–1546|Italian Wars]]. Philip was present at the [[Siege of Perpignan (1542)|Siege of Perpignan]] in 1542, but did not see action as the Spanish army under Alba decisively defeated the besieging French forces under the [[Henry II of France|Dauphin of France]]. On his way back to Castile, Philip received the oath of allegiance of the [[Aragon]]ese Cortes at [[Monzón]]. His political training had begun a year previously under his father, who had found his son studious, grave, and prudent beyond his years, and having decided to train and initiate him in the government of Spain. The king-emperor's interactions with his son during his stay in Spain convinced him of Philip's precocity in statesmanship, and so he determined to leave in his hands the [[List of Spanish regents|regency of Spain]] in 1543. Philip, who had previously been made the [[Duke of Milan]] in 1540, began governing the most extensive empire in the world at the young age of sixteen.

Charles left Philip with experienced advisors—notably the secretary [[Francisco de los Cobos]] and the general Duke of Alba. Philip was also left with extensive written instructions which emphasised "piety, patience, modesty, and distrust." These principles of Charles were gradually assimilated by his son, who would grow up to become grave, self-possessed and cautious. Personally, Philip spoke softly, and had an icy self-mastery; in the words of one of his ministers, "he had a smile that cut like a sword."<ref>Encyclopedia of World Biography 2004.</ref>

==Domestic policy==

[[File:Koning Spanje Filips II 1-5 Philipsdaalder 1566.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Portrait of Philip II on 1/5 Philipsdaalder, struck 1566, Guelders, Low Countries.]]

After living in the [[Netherlands]] in the early years of his reign,<ref>Parker, Geoffrey. ''The Dutch Revolt.''. London: Penguin. p.41.</ref> Philip II decided to return to Spain. Although sometimes described as an absolute monarch, Philip faced many constitutional constraints on his authority. This was largely influenced by the growing strength of the bureaucracy during Philip's reign.

The [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] Empire was not a single monarchy with one legal system but a federation of separate realms, each jealously guarding its own rights against those of the [[House of Habsburg]]. In practice, Philip often found his authority over-ruled by local assemblies, and his word less effective than that of local lords.<ref>Parker, ''The Dutch Revolt''. p.42.</ref>

Philip carried [[List of titles and honours of the Heir Apparent to the Spanish Throne#Titles held by the heir apparent to the Spanish Throne|several titles]] including [[Prince of Asturias]] as [[List of heirs to the Spanish throne|heir to the Spanish kingdoms and empire]]. The newest constituent kingdom in the empire was [[Kingdom of Navarre#Spanish conquest of Navarre|Navarre]], a realm invaded by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] mainly with Castilian troops (1512), and annexed to Castile with an ambiguous status (1513). [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|War across Navarre]] continued until 1528 ([[Treaty of Madrid (1526)#Madrid|Treaties of Madrid and Cambrai]]). Charles V proposed to end hostilities with King [[Henry II of Navarre]]—the legitimate monarch of Navarre—by marrying his son Philip to the heiress of Navarre, [[Jeanne III of Navarre]]. The marriage would provide a dynastic solution to instability in Navarre, it would make him king of all Navarre and prince of independent [[Béarn]], as well as lord of a large part of southern France. However, the French nobility under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] opposed the arrangement, and successfully ended the prospects of marriage between the heirs of Habsburg and Albret in 1541.

In his will Charles stated his doubts over Navarre and recommended his son to give the kingdom back. Both King Charles and his son Philip II failed to abide by the elective (contractual) nature of the Crown of Navarre, and took the kingdom for granted. This sparked mounting tension not only with King [[Henry II of Navarre]] and Queen [[Jeanne III of Navarre]], but with the Parliament of the Spanish Navarre (''Cortes'', ''The Three States'') and the ''Diputación'' for breach of the [[Fueros of Navarre|realm specific laws (fueros)]]—violation of the ''pactum subjectionis'' as ratified by Ferdinand. Tensions in Navarre came to a head in 1592 after several years of disagreements over the agenda of the intended parliamentary session.

In November 1592, the Parliament (''Cortes'') of Aragón revolted against another breach of the realm specific laws, so the Attorney General (''Justicia'') of the kingdom Juan de Lanuza was executed on Philip II's orders, with his secretary [[Antonio Perez]] taking to exile in France. In Navarre the major strongholds of the kingdom were garrisoned by troops alien to the kingdom (Castilians) in conspicuous violation of the laws of Navarre, and the Parliament had long been refusing to pledge loyalty to Philip II's son and heir apparent without a proper ceremony. On 20 November 1592 a ghostly Parliament session was called pushed by Philip II, who had arrived in [[Pamplona#Three boroughs and one city|Pamplona]] at the head of an unspecified military force, and one only point on his agenda—attendance to the session was kept blank on the minutes: unlawful appointments of trusted Castilian officials and an imposition of his son as future king of Navarre at the Santa Maria Cathedral. A ceremony was held before the bishop of Pamplona (22 November), but its customary procedure and terms were altered. Protests erupted in Pamplona, but they were quelled.

Philip II also grappled with the problem of the large [[Morisco]] population in Spain, who were sometimes forcibly converted to Christianity by his predecessors. In 1569, the [[Morisco Revolt]] broke out in the southern province of [[Granada (province)|Granada]] in defiance of attempts to suppress Moorish customs; and Philip ordered the expulsion of the Moriscos from Granada and their dispersal to other provinces.

Despite its immense dominions, Spain was a country with a sparse population that yielded a limited income to the crown (in contrast to France, for example, which was much more heavily populated). Philip faced major difficulties in raising taxes, the collection of which was largely farmed out to local lords. He was able to finance his military campaigns only by taxing and exploiting the local resources of his empire. The flow of income from the [[New World]] proved vital to his militant foreign policy, but nonetheless his exchequer several times faced bankruptcy.

Philip's reign saw a flourishing of cultural excellence in Spain, the beginning of what is called the [[Spanish Golden Age|''Golden Age'']], creating a lasting legacy in literature, music, and the visual arts.

==Economy==

Charles V had left Philip with a debt of about 36 million [[ducat]]s and an annual deficit of 1 million ducats. This debt caused Phillip II to default on loans in 1557, 1560, 1575, and 1596 (including debt to Poland, known as [[Neapolitan sums]]). This happened because the lenders had no power over the king and could not force him to repay his loans. These defaults were just the beginning of Spain's economic troubles as Spain's kings would default six more times in the next 65 years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Azar|title=War in Human Civilization|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-923663-3|page=488|edition=4.}}</ref> Aside from reducing state revenues for overseas expeditions, the domestic policies of Philip II further burdened Spain, and would, in the following century, contribute to its decline, as maintained by some historians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Elliott|first=J.H.|title=Imperial Spain 1469–1716|year=2002|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=0-14-100703-6|pages=285–291|edition=Repr.}}</ref>

Spain was subject to different assemblies: the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] along with the assembly in [[Navarre]] and one each for the three regions of [[Aragon]], which preserved traditional rights and laws from the time when they were separate kingdoms. This made Spain and its possessions difficult to rule, unlike France which, while divided into regional states, had a single [[French States-General|Estates-General]]. The lack of a viable supreme assembly led to power defaulting into Philip's hands, especially as manager and final arbiter of the constant conflict between different authorities. To deal with the difficulties arising from this situation, authority was administered by local agents appointed by the crown and viceroys carrying out crown instructions. Philip felt it necessary to be involved in the detail and presided over specialised councils for state affairs, finance, war, and the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]].

He played groups against each other, leading to a system of checks and balances that managed affairs inefficiently, even to the extent of damaging state business, as in the [[Antonio Perez|Perez affair]]. Following a fire in [[Valladolid]] in 1561, he resisted calls to move his Court to [[Lisbon]], an act that could have curbed centralisation and bureaucracy domestically as well as relaxed rule in the Empire. Instead, with the traditional Royal and [[Primate of Spain|Primacy]] seat of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] now essentially obsolete, Philip moved his Court to the Castilian stronghold of [[Madrid]]. Except for a brief period under [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]], Madrid has remained the capital of Spain to the present day.

Whereas his father had been forced to an itinerant rule as a medieval king, Philip ruled at a critical turning point in European history toward [[modernity]]. He mainly directed state affairs, even when not at Court. Indeed, when his health began failing, he worked from his quarters in the Palace-Monastery-Pantheon of [[El Escorial]] he had built. But Philip did not enjoy the supremacy that [[Louis XIV of France]] would in the next century, nor was such a rule necessarily possible at his time. The inefficiencies of the Spanish state and restrictively regulated industry under his rule were common to many contemporary countries. Further, the dispersal of the Moriscos from [[Granada]] – motivated by the fear they might support a Muslim invasion – had serious negative economic effects, particularly in that region.

==Foreign policy==
Philip's foreign policies were determined by a combination of Catholic fervour and dynastic objectives. He considered himself the chief defender of Catholic Europe, both against the [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman Turks]] and against the forces of the [[Protestant Reformation]]. He never relented from his fight against [[heresy]], defending the Catholic faith and limiting freedom of worship within his territories.<ref>As Philip wrote in 1566 to [[Luis de Zúñiga y Requesens|Luis de Requesens]]: "You can assure his Holiness that rather than suffer the least injury to religion and the service of God, I would lose all my states and a hundred lives if I had them, for I do not intend to rule over heretics." {{Harvnb|Pettegree|p=214}}.</ref> These territories included his patrimony in the Netherlands, where Protestantism had taken deep root. Following the [[Revolt of the Netherlands]] in 1568, Philip waged a campaign against Dutch heresy and secession. It also dragged in the English and the French at times and expanded into the German Rhineland with the [[Cologne War]]. This series of conflicts lasted for the rest of his life. Philip's constant involvement in European wars took a significant toll on the treasury and played a huge role in leading the Crown into economic difficulties and even bankruptcies.

In 1588, the English defeated Philip's [[Spanish Armada]], thwarting his planned invasion of the country to reinstate Catholicism. But the war continued for the next sixteen years, in a complex series of struggles that included France, Ireland and the main battle zone, the [[Low Countries]]. It would not end until all the leading protagonists, including himself, had died. Earlier, however, after several setbacks in his reign and especially that of his father, Philip did achieve a decisive victory against the Turks at the [[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Lepanto]] in 1571, with the allied fleet of the [[Holy League (1571)|Holy League]], which he had put under the command of his illegitimate brother, [[John of Austria]]. He also successfully secured his succession to the throne of [[Iberian Union|Portugal]].

With regard to Philip's overseas possessions, in response to the reforms imposed by the Ordenanzas, extensive questionnaires were distributed to every major town and region in New Spain called [[relaciones geográficas]]. These surveys helped the Spanish monarchy to govern these overseas conquests more effectively.

===Italy===
{{Main|Italian Wars}}

Charles V formally abdicated the throne of Naples to Philip on 25 July 1554, and the young king was invested with the kingdom (officially called "Naples and Sicily") on 2 October by [[Pope Julius III]]. The date of Charles' abdication of the throne of Sicily is uncertain, but Philip was invested with this kingdom (officially "Sicily and Jerusalem") on 18 November 1554 by Julius.<ref>[[Fernand Braudel]], ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', vol. 2 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995), 935–36 and notes.</ref> In 1556, Philip decided to declare war in the [[Papal States]] and temporarily gobbled up territory there, perhaps in response to [[Pope Paul IV]]'s anti-Spanish outlook. According to Philip II, he was doing it for the benefit of the [[Catholic Church|Church]].

In a letter from [[Francisco de Vargas y Mexia|Francisco de Vargas]] to the Princess Dowager of Portugal, Regent of Spain, dated 22 September 1556, it is written:
{{quote|"I have reported to your Highness what has been happening here, and how far the Pope is going in his fury and vain imaginings. His Majesty could not do otherwise than have a care for his reputation and dominions. I am sure your Highness will have had more recent news from the Duke of Alva, who has taken the field with an excellent army and has penetrated so far into the Pope's territory that his cavalry is raiding up to ten miles{{Clarify|post-text=(Italian miles?)|date=March 2014}} from Rome, where there is such panic that the population would have run away had not the gates been closed. The Pope has fallen ill with rage, and was struggling with a fever on the 16th of this month. The two Carafa brothers, the Cardinal and Count Montorio, do not agree, and they and Piero Strozzi are not on as good terms as they were in the past. They would like to discuss peace. The best thing would be for the Pope to die, for he is the poison at the root of all this trouble and more which may occur. His Majesty's intention is only to wrest the knife from this madman's hand and make him return to a sense of his dignity, acting like the protector of the [[Holy See|Apostolic See]], in whose name, and that of the [[College of Cardinals]], his Majesty has publicly proclaimed that he has seized all he is occupying. The Pope is now sending again to the potentates of Italy for help. I hope he will gain as little thereby as he has done in the past, and that the French will calm down. May God give us peace in the end, as their Majesties desire and deserve!"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=88609|title=Spain: September 1556|author=Royall Tyler (editor)|publisher=Institute of Historical Research|year=1954|work=Calendar of State Papers, Spain, Vol. 13: 1554–1558|accessdate=19 April 2013}}</ref>}}

Pope Paul IV charged a seven-member commission with preparing a peace agreement. The efforts were later abandoned and the war continued. On 27 August 1557, [[Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Fernando Alvarez de Toledo]], Duke of Alba and Viceroy of Naples, was at the walls of Rome, ready to lead his troops for a final assault. On 13 September 1557, [[Carlo Carafa|Cardinal Carlo Carafa]] signed a peace agreement, accepting all of the duke's conditions.<ref name=fiuRebiba>{{cite web|url=http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1555-ii.htm|accessdate=2010-04-21|title=The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church |author=Salvador Miranda|year=2010|publisher=[[Florida International University]]}}</ref>

Philip led Spain into the final phase of the [[Italian Wars]]. The Spanish army decisively defeated the French at [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|St. Quentin]] in 1557 and at [[Battle of Gravelines (1558)|Gravelines]] in 1558. The resulting [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]] in 1559 secured [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont]], Savoy, and [[Corsica]] for the Spanish allied states, the [[Duchy of Savoy]], and the [[Republic of Genoa]]. France recognised Spanish control over the [[Franche-Comté]], but, more importantly, the treaty also confirmed the direct control of Philip over [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], Sicily, [[Sardinia]], and the [[State of Presidi]], and indirectly (through his dominance of the rulers of [[Tuscany]], Genoa, and other minor states) of all Italy. The Pope was a natural Spanish ally. The only truly independent entities on Italian soil were the allied Duchy of Savoy and the [[Republic of Venice]]. Spanish control of Italy would last until the early eighteenth century. Ultimately, the treaty ended the 60-year, Franco-Spanish wars for supremacy in Italy.

By the end of the wars in 1559, [[Habsburg Spain]] had been established as the premier power of Europe, to the detriment of France. In France, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] was fatally wounded in a joust held during the celebrations of the peace. His death led to the accession of his 15-year-old son [[Francis II of France|Francis II]], who in turn soon died. The French monarchy was thrown into turmoil, which increased further with the outbreak of the [[French Wars of Religion]] that would last for several decades. The states of Italy were reduced to second-rate powers and Milan and Naples were annexed directly to Spain. Mary Tudor's death in 1558 enabled Philip to seal the treaty by marrying Henry II's daughter, [[Elisabeth of Valois]], later giving him a claim to the throne of France on behalf of his daughter by Elisabeth, [[Isabel Clara Eugenia]].

===France===
{{main|French Wars of Religion}}
The French Wars of Religion (1562–98) were primarily fought between French Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). The conflict involved the factional disputes between the aristocratic houses of France, such as the House of Bourbon and House of Guise (Lorraine), and both sides received assistance from foreign sources.

Philip signed the [[Treaty of Vaucelles]] with Henry II of France in 1556. Based on the terms of the treaty, the territory of the [[Franche-Comté]] was to be relinquished to Philip. However, the treaty was broken shortly afterwards. France and Spain waged war in northern France and Italy over the following years. Spanish victories at St. Quentin and Gravelines led to the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, in which France recognised Spanish sovereignty over the Franche-Comté.

During the [[War of the Portuguese Succession]], the pretender [[António, Prior of Crato|António]] fled to France following his defeats and, as Philip’s armies had not yet occupied the [[Azores]], he sailed there with a large Anglo-French fleet under [[Filippo di Piero Strozzi|Filippo Strozzi]], a [[Florence|Florentine]] exile in the service of France. The naval [[Battle of Terceira]] took place on 26 July 1582, in the sea near the [[Azores Islands|Azores]], off [[São Miguel Island]], as part of the War of the Portuguese Succession and the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)]]. The Spanish navy defeated the combined Anglo-French fleet that had sailed to preserve control of the Azores under António. The French naval contingent was the largest French force sent overseas before the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].<ref>Jan Glete p.156</ref>

The Spanish victory at Terceira was followed by the [[Conquest of the Azores|Battle of the Azores]] between the Portuguese loyal to the claimant António, supported by French and English troops, and the Spanish-Portuguese forces loyal to Philip commanded by the admiral Don [[Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz|Álvaro de Bazán]]. Victory in Azores completed the incorporation of [[Spanish Empire|Portugal into the Spanish Empire]].<ref>Nascimiento Rodrigues/Tessaleno Devezas p.122</ref>

Philip financed the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] during the French Wars of Religion. He directly intervened in the final phases of the wars (1589–1598), ordering the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]] into France in an effort to unseat [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], and perhaps dreaming of placing his favourite daughter, Isabel Clara Eugenia, on the French throne. Elizabeth of Valois, Philip's third wife and Isabella's mother, had already ceded any claim to the French Crown with her marriage to Philip. However the ''[[Parlement de Paris]]'', in power of the Catholic party, gave verdict that Isabella Clara Eugenia was "the legitimate sovereign" of France. Philip's interventions in the fighting – sending the Duke of Parma, to end Henry IV's [[Siege of Paris, 1590|siege of Paris]] in 1590 – and the siege of Rouen in 1592 contributed in saving the French Catholic Leagues's cause against a Protestant monarchy.

In 1593, Henry agreed to convert to Catholicism; weary of war, most French Catholics switched to his side against the hardline core of the Catholic League, who were portrayed by Henry's propagandists as puppets of a foreign monarch, Philip. By the end of 1594 certain League members were still working against Henry across the country, but all relied on the support of Spain. In January 1595, therefore, Henry officially declared war on Spain, to show Catholics, that Philip was using religion as a cover for an attack on the French state, and Protestants, that he had not become a puppet of Spain through his conversion, while hoping to take the war to Spain and make territorial gain.<ref>Knecht French Civil Wars p272</ref>

French victory at the [[Battle of Fontaine-Française]] marked an end to the Catholic League in France. Spain launched a concerted offensive in 1595, taking [[Siege of Doullens|Doullens]], [[Cambrai]] and [[Le Catelet]] and in the spring of 1596 [[Siege of Calais (1596)|capturing Calais]] by April. Following the [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|Spanish capture of Amiens]] in March 1597 the French crown laid siege to it until it managed to [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|reconquer Amiens]] from the overstretched Spanish forces in September 1597. Henry then negotiated a peace with Spain. The war was only drawn to an official close, however, after the [[Edict of Nantes]], with the [[Peace of Vervins]] in May 1598.

The 1598 Treaty of Vervins was largely a restatement of the 1559 Peace of Câteau-Cambrésis and Spanish forces and subsidies were withdrawn; meanwhile, Henry issued the Edict of Nantes, which offered a high degree of religious toleration for French Protestants. The military interventions in France thus ended in an ironic fashion for Philip: they had failed to oust Henry from the throne or suppress Protestantism in France and yet they had played a decisive part in helping the French Catholic cause gain the conversion of Henry, ensuring that Catholicism would remain France's official and majority faith – matters of paramount importance for the devoutly Catholic Spanish king.

===Mediterranean===

[[File:Flag of the Tercios Morados Viejos.svg|thumb|Flag of Spanish armies under Philip II]]

In the early part of his reign Philip was concerned with the rising power of the Ottoman Empire under [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. Fear of Islamic domination in the Mediterranean caused him to pursue an aggressive foreign policy.

In 1558, Turkish admiral [[Piyale Pasha]] captured the [[Balearic Islands]], especially inflicting great damage on [[Minorca]] and enslaving many, while raiding the coasts of the Spanish mainland. Philip appealed to the Pope and other powers in Europe to bring an end to the rising [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] threat. Since his father's losses against the Ottomans and against [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] in 1541, the major European sea powers in the Mediterranean, namely Spain and [[Venice]], became hesitant in confronting the Ottomans. The myth of "Turkish invincibility" was becoming a popular story, causing fear and panic among the people.

In 1560, Philip II organised a ''Holy League'' between Spain and the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Republic of Genoa]], the [[Papal States]], the [[Duchy of Savoy]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]. The joint fleet was assembled at [[Messina]] and consisted of 200 ships (60 galleys and 140 other vessels) carrying a total of 30,000 soldiers under the command of [[Giovanni Andrea Doria]], nephew of the famous Genoese admiral [[Andrea Doria]].

On 12 March 1560, the Holy League captured the island of [[Djerba]] which had a strategic location and could control the sea routes between [[Algiers]] and [[Tripoli]]. As a response, [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] sent an Ottoman fleet of 120 ships under the command of [[Piyale Pasha]], which arrived at Djerba on 9 May 1560. The battle lasted until 14 May 1560, and the forces of Piyale Pasha and [[Turgut Reis]] (who joined Piyale Pasha on the third day of the battle) had an overwhelming victory at the [[Battle of Djerba]].

The Holy League lost 60 ships (30 galleys) and 20,000 men, and Giovanni Andrea Doria was barely able to escape with a small vessel. The Ottomans retook the Fortress of Djerba, whose Spanish commander, D. [[Álvaro de Sande]] attempted to escape with a ship but was followed and eventually captured by [[Turgut Reis]]. In 1565 the Ottomans sent [[Siege of Malta (1565)|a large expedition to Malta]], which laid siege to several forts on the island, taking some of them. The Spanish sent a relief force, which finally drove the Ottoman army out of the island.

The grave threat posed by the increasing Ottoman domination of the Mediterranean was reversed in one of history's most decisive battles, with the destruction of nearly the entire Ottoman fleet at the [[Battle of Lepanto]] in 1571, by the Holy League under the command of Philip's half brother, [[John of Austria|Don Juan of Austria]]. A fleet sent by Philip, again commanded by Don John, reconquered Tunis from the Ottomans in 1573. However, the Turks soon rebuilt their fleet and in 1574 [[Uluç Ali Reis]] managed to recapture [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|Tunis]] with a force of 250 galleys and a siege which lasted 40 days. However, [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]] marked a permanent reversal in the balance of naval power in the Mediterranean and the end of the threat of Ottoman control.
In 1585 a peace treaty was signed with the Ottomans.

==Revolt in the Netherlands==
{{Main| Dutch Revolt}}

Philip's rule in the seventeen separate provinces known collectively as the Netherlands faced many difficulties; this led to open warfare in 1568. He insisted on direct control over events in the Netherlands despite being over two weeks' ride away in Madrid. There was discontent in the Netherlands about Philip's taxation demands, and the incessant [[Inquisition of the Netherlands|persecution]] of Protestants. In 1566, Protestant preachers sparked anti-clerical riots known as the [[Dutch Revolt#1566 — Iconoclasm and repression|Iconoclast Fury]]; in response to growing Protestant influence, the Duke of Alba's army went on the offensive, further alienating the local aristocracy. In 1572 a prominent exiled member of the Dutch aristocracy, [[William the Silent]] (Prince of Orange), invaded the Netherlands with a Protestant army, but he only succeeded in holding two provinces, [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]].

The war continued. The [[States General of the Netherlands|States General]] of the northern provinces, united in the 1579 [[Union of Utrecht]], passed an [[Act of Abjuration]] declaring that they no longer recognised Philip as their king. The southern Netherlands (what is now Belgium and Luxembourg) remained under Spanish rule. In 1584, [[William the Silent]] was assassinated by [[Balthasar Gérard]], after Philip had offered a reward of 25,000 crowns to anyone who killed him, calling him a "pest on the whole of Christianity and the enemy of the human race". The Dutch forces continued to fight on under Orange's son [[Maurice of Nassau]], who received modest help from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1585. The Dutch gained an advantage over the Spanish because of their growing economic strength, in contrast to Philip's burgeoning economic troubles. The war, known as the [[Eighty Years' War]], only came to an end in 1648, when the Dutch Republic was recognised by Spain as independent.

==King of Portugal==
{{Main|Iberian Union}}
[[File:Anthony I of Portugal.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Anthony I of Portugal]]]]
In 1578 young king [[Sebastian of Portugal]] died at the [[Battle of Alcácer Quibir]] without descendants, triggering a [[1580 Portuguese succession crisis|succession crisis]]. His granduncle, the elderly [[Henry I of Portugal|Cardinal Henry]], succeeded him as King, but Henry also had no descendants, having taken holy orders. When the Cardinal-King died two years after Sebastian's disappearance, three grandchildren of [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] claimed the throne: [[Infanta Catarina, Duchess of Braganza]], [[António, Prior of Crato]], and Philip II of Spain. António was acclaimed [[King of Portugal]] in many cities and towns throughout the country, but members of the Council of Governors of Portugal who had supported Philip escaped to Spain and declared him to be the legal successor of Henry.
Philip II then marched into Portugal and defeated Prior António's troops in the [[Battle of Alcântara (1580)|Battle of Alcântara]]. The troops commanded by the 3rd [[Duke of Alba]]<ref>Geoffrey Parker ''The army of Flanders and the Spanish road'', London, 1972 ISBN 0-521-08462-8, p. 35</ref> imposed subjection to Philip before entering Lisbon, where he seized an immense treasure.<ref>[[Henry Kamen]], ''The duke of Alba'' (New Haven–London: Yale University Press, 2004), Pp. x + 204.</ref> Philip II of Spain was crowned ''Philip I'' of Portugal in 1581 (recognised as king by the [[Portuguese Cortes]] of [[Tomar]]) and a sixty-year [[personal union]] under the rule of the [[Philippine Dynasty]] began. When Philip left for Madrid in 1583, he made his nephew [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert of Austria]] his viceroy in Lisbon. In Madrid he established a Council of Portugal to advise him on Portuguese affairs, giving excellent positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish courts, and allowing Portugal to maintain autonomous law, currency, and government.

==Relations with England and Ireland==

The whiteness of his skin corresponds to his white stockings and the greenish golden sheen on his armour. In this way, the prince's pale complexion appears more distinguished.]]

Philip's father arranged his marriage to 37-year-old Queen [[Mary I of England]], Charles' maternal first cousin. To elevate Philip to Mary's rank, his father ceded the crown of Naples, as well as his claim to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], to him.

Their marriage at [[Winchester Cathedral]] on 25 July 1554 took place just two days after their first meeting. Philip's view of the affair was entirely political. Lord Chancellor Gardiner and the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]] petitioned Mary to consider marrying an Englishman, preferring [[Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon|Edward Courtenay]].

Under the terms of the [[Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain]], Philip was to enjoy Mary I's titles and honours for as long as their marriage should last. All official documents, including [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]], were to be dated with both their names, and Parliament was to be called under the joint authority of the couple. Coins were also to show the heads of both Mary and Philip. The marriage treaty also provided that England would not be obliged to provide military support to Philip's father in any war. The Privy Council instructed that Philip and Mary should be joint signatories of royal documents, and this was enacted by an Act of Parliament, which gave him the title of king and stated that he "shall aid her Highness ... in the happy administration of her Grace’s realms and dominions."<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Adams |editor-first=George Burton |editor-last2=Stephens |editor-first2=H.

Philip's wife had succeeded to the Kingdom of Ireland, but the title of [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542|King of Ireland]] had been created in 1542 by Henry VIII after he was excommunicated, and so it was not recognised by Catholic monarchs. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV]] rectified this by issuing a [[papal bull]] recognising Philip and Mary as rightful King and Queen of Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|author=Francois Velde|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/ireland_docs.htm#bull1555|title=Text of 1555 Bull|publisher=Heraldica.org|date=25 July 2003|accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> [[County Offaly|King's County]] and [[Daingean|Philipstown]] in Ireland were named after Philip as King of Ireland in 1556.

The couple's joint royal style after Philip ascended the Spanish throne in 1556 was: ''Philip and Mary, by the Grace of God King and Queen of England, Spain, France, Jerusalem, both the Sicilies and Ireland, Defenders of the Faith, Archdukes of Austria, Dukes of Burgundy, Milan and Brabant, Counts of Habsburg, Flanders and Tirol''.

However, the couple had no children. Mary died in 1558 before the union could revitalise the Roman Catholic Church in England. With her death, Philip lost his rights to the English throne (including the ancient [[English claims to the French throne]]) and ceased to be King of England, Ireland and (as claimed by them) France.

Philip's distaff great-grandson, [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans]], married [[Princess Henrietta of England]] in 1661; in 1807, the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] claim to the British throne passed to the descendants of their child [[Anne Marie d'Orléans]].

===After Mary I's death===
[[File:Dominios de Felipe II.svg|thumb|450px|Part of Philip's dominions in 1581]]

Upon Mary's death, the throne went to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] I. Philip had no wish to sever his tie with England, and had sent a proposal of marriage to Elizabeth. However, she delayed in answering, and in that time learned Philip was also considering a [[House of Valois|Valois]] alliance. Elizabeth I was the Protestant daughter of Henry VIII and [[Anne Boleyn]]. This union was deemed illegitimate by English Catholics, who disputed the validity of both the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and of his subsequent marriage to Boleyn, and hence claimed that [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], the Catholic great granddaughter of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], was the legitimate heir to the throne.

For many years Philip maintained peace with England, and even defended Elizabeth from the Pope's threat of excommunication. This was a measure taken to preserve a European balance of power. Ultimately, Elizabeth allied England with the Protestant rebels in the Netherlands. Further, English ships began a policy of piracy against Spanish trade and threatened to plunder the great Spanish treasure ships coming from the new world. English ships went so far as to attack a Spanish port. The last straw for Philip was the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]] signed by Elizabeth in 1585 – promising troops and supplies to the rebels. Although it can be argued this English action was the result of Philip's [[Treaty of Joinville]] with the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League of France]], Philip considered it an act of war by England.

The execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1587 ended Philip's hopes of placing a Catholic on the English throne. He turned instead to more direct plans to invade England, with vague plans to return the country to Catholicism. In 1588, he sent a fleet, the [[Spanish Armada]], to rendezvous with the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]'s army and convey it across the English Channel. However, the operation had little chance of success from the beginning, because of lengthy delays, lack of communication between Philip II and his two commanders and the lack of a deep bay for the fleet. At the point of attack, a storm struck the [[English Channel]], already known for its harsh currents and choppy waters, which devastated large numbers of the Spanish fleet. There was a tightly fought battle against the English navy; it was by no means a slaughter, but the Spanish were forced into a retreat, and the overwhelming majority of the Armada was destroyed by the harsh weather.

[[File:Philip II of Spain by Antonio Moro.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Philip, in the prime of his life, by Giacomo Antonio Moro]]

Eventually, three more Armadas were assembled; two were sent to England in 1596 and 1597, but both also failed; the third (1599) was diverted to the Azores and Canary Islands to fend off raids. This [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)]] would be fought to a grinding end, but not until both Philip II (d. 1598) and Elizabeth I (d. 1603) were dead.

The defeat of the Spanish Armada gave great heart to the Protestant cause across Europe. The storm that smashed the Armada was seen by many of Philip's enemies as a sign of the will of God. Many Spaniards blamed the admiral of the Armada for its failure, but Philip, despite his complaint that he had sent his ships to fight the English, not the elements, was not among them. A year later, Philip remarked:
[[File:Emanuel van Meteren Historie ppn 051504510 MG 8667 Philipppus II.tif|thumb|Engraving of Philip II]]
{{Cquote|It is impiety, and almost blasphemy to presume to know the will of God. It comes from the sin of pride. Even kings, Brother Nicholas, must submit to being used by God's will without knowing what it is. They must never seek to use it.|4=Philip II}}

The Spanish navy was rebuilt, and intelligence networks were improved. A measure of the character of Philip can be gathered by the fact that he personally saw to it that the wounded men of the Armada were treated and received pensions, and that the families of those who died were compensated for their loss, which was highly unusual for the time.

While the invasion had been averted, England was unable to take advantage of this success. An attempt to use her newfound advantage at sea with a [[English Armada|counter armada]] the following year failed disastrously. Likewise, English buccaneering and attempts to seize territories in the Caribbean were defeated by Spain's rebuilt navy and their improved intelligence networks (although Cádiz was destroyed by an Anglo-Dutch force after a failed attempt to seize the treasure fleet).

He was succeeded by his son/grandnephew [[Philip III of Spain|Philip III]].

==Legacy==
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Philip II of Spain}}

Under Philip II, Spain reached the peak of its power. However, in spite of the great and increasing quantities of gold and silver flowing into his coffers from the American mines, the riches of the Portuguese spice trade, and the enthusiastic support of the Habsburg dominions for the [[Counter-Reformation]], he would never succeed in suppressing Protestantism or defeating the Dutch rebellion. Early in his reign, the Dutch might have laid down their weapons if he had desisted in trying to suppress Protestantism,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} but his devotion to Catholicism would not permit him to do so. He was a devout Catholic and exhibited the typical 16th century disdain for religious heterodoxy; he said, "Before suffering the slightest damage to religion in the service of God, I would lose all of my estates and a hundred lives, if I had them, because I do not wish nor do I desire to be the ruler of heretics."<ref>{{YouTube|id=qhlAqklH0do#t=21m27s|title=The Myth of the Spanish Inquisition}} (at 21:27 – 21:40). BBC.</ref>

The defeat of Protestantism was always keen in Philip's mind.  For a while, he ruled England jointly with Queen Mary Tudor and a reconciliation with the Catholic Church followed. Heresy trials were reestablished and hundreds of Protestants burned at the stake.  England and Philip parted ways after the death of his Queen, nicknamed "Bloody Mary". Philip's gravest mistake over the long run was his attempt to violently eradicate Protestantism from the Netherlands which was a major economic asset for the empire.  Under harsh occupation, the Dutch finally rebelled and wrested independence after an eighty-year war, the strain of which did Philip's realm little good.  His greatest battlefield accomplishment was the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at Lepanto which turned the tide against Turkish aggression.

As he strove to enforce Catholic orthodoxy through an intensification of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], students were barred from studying elsewhere and books printed by Spaniards outside the kingdom were banned. Even a highly respected churchman like [[Bartolome Carranza|Archbishop Carranza]] of Toledo was jailed by the Inquisition for seventeen years for publishing ideas that seemed sympathetic in some degree to Protestantism. Such strict enforcement of orthodox belief was successful and Spain avoided the religiously inspired strife tearing apart other European dominions.

Yet the [[School of Salamanca]] flourished under his reign. [[Martín de Azpilcueta]], highly honoured at Rome by several popes, and looked on as an oracle of learning, published his ''Manuale sive Enchiridion Confessariorum et Poenitentium'' (Rome, 1568), long a classical text in the schools and in ecclesiastical practice. [[Francisco Suárez]], generally regarded as the greatest scholastic after [[Thomas Aquinas]] and regarded during his lifetime as being the greatest living philosopher and theologian, was writing and lecturing, not only in Spain but also in Rome (1680–1685), where [[Pope Gregory XIII]] attended the first lecture that he gave. [[Luis de Molina]] published his ''De liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia, praedestinatione et reprobatione concordia'' (1588), wherein he put forth the doctrine attempting to reconcile the [[omniscience]] of God with human [[free will]] that came to be known as [[Molinism]], thereby contributing to what was one of the most important intellectual debates of the time; Molinism became the ''de facto'' [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] doctrine on the aforementioned matters, and is still advocated today by [[William Lane Craig]] and [[Alvin Plantinga]], among others.

The Invincible Armada (by James Johonnot) |publisher=Authorama.com |accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> However, some historians classify this anti-Spanish analysis as part of the [[Black Legend]]. In a more recent example of popular culture, Philip II's portrayal in ''[[Fire Over England]]'' (1937) is not entirely unsympathetic; he is shown as a very hard working, intelligent, religious, somewhat paranoid ruler whose prime concern is his country but who had no understanding of the English, despite his former co-monarchy there.

Even in countries that remained Catholic, primarily France and the Italian states, fear and envy of Spanish success and domination created a wide receptiveness for the worst possible descriptions of Philip II. Although some efforts have been made to separate legend from reality,<ref>Hume, Martin. ''Philip II of Spain'', London, 1897. Martin tried to retrieve the prejudiced views on the king at his time, something Carl Bratli also tried to do in his ''Filip of Spanien'' (Koebenhaven, 1909). Their works oppose to those of Ludwig Pfandl, ''Felipe II.

Spanish-speaking historians tend to assess his political and military achievements, sometimes deliberately avoiding issues such as the king's lukewarmness (or even support) towards Catholic fanaticism.<ref>In his work, ''Felipe II'' (Madrid, 1943) W.T. Walsh depicts Felipe's reign as a prosperous and successful one, tending to make an apology of it. Fernández Álvarez, in ''España y los españoles en la Edad Moderna'' (Salamanca, 1979), points out how White Legend supporters flourished during the 1940s and 1950s, and how they omitted the darkest issues of Felipe's reign</ref> English-speaking historians tend to show Philip II as a fanatical, despotical, criminal, imperialist monster,<ref>Those kinds of adjectives can be read in M. Van Durme's 1953 ''El Cardenal Granvela''</ref> minimising his military victories ([[Battle of Lepanto (1571)|Battle of Lepanto]], [[Battle of St. Quentin (1557)|Battle of Saint Quentin]], etc.) to mere anecdotes, and magnifying his defeats (namely the [[Invincible Armada]]<ref>Cabrera de Córdoba, ''Felipe II rey de España'', ed. RAH, 1877, criticizes how Felipe's victories are being minimised by English historians, and points out the small consequences of defeats such as the Invincible Armada</ref>) even though at the time those defeats did not result in great political or military changes in the balance of power in Europe. Moreover, it has been noted that objectively assessing Philip's reign would suppose to re-analyze the reign of his greatest opponents, namely England's Queen [[Elizabeth I]] and the Dutch [[William the Silent]], who are popularly regarded as great heroes in their home nations; if Philip II is to be shown to the English or Dutch public in a more favourable light, Elizabeth and William would lose their cold-blooded, fanatical enemy, thus decreasing their own patriotic accomplishments.<ref>This appreciation is noted by Martin Hume in his aforementioned work ("Philip II of Spain", London 1897), pointing out how difficult is to show Philip II in a more favorable light to his fellow Englishmen because of that.</ref>

Philip II's reign can hardly be characterised by its failures. He ended French Valois ambitions in Italy and brought about the Habsburg ascendency in Europe. He commenced settlements in the [[Philippines]], which were named after him,{{efn|The Philippine archipelago was first sighted by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] on his expedition to the Spice Islands, but it was during Philip's reign that Spanish explorer [[Ruy Lopez de Villalobos]] renamed them from the archipelago of St. Lazarus to ''Las Islas Filipinas'' in Philip's honour.}} and established the first trans-Pacific trade route between America and Asia. He secured the Portuguese kingdom and empire. He succeeded in increasing the importation of silver in the face of English, Dutch, and French privateers, overcoming multiple financial crises and consolidating Spain's overseas empire. Although clashes would be ongoing, he ended the major threat posed to Europe by the Ottoman navy.

Philip continued his father's style of "[[Majesty]]" (Latin: ''Maiestas''; Spanish: ''Majestad'') in preference to that of "[[Highness]]" (''Celsitudo''; ''Alteza''). In diplomatic texts, he continued the use of the title "[[Rex Catholicismus|Most Catholic]]" (''Rex Catholicismus''; ''Rey Católico'') first bestowed by [[Pope Alexander VI]] on [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in 1496.

Following the [[Act for the Marriage of Queen Mary to Philip of Spain|Act of Parliament sanctioning his marriage with Mary]], the couple was styled "Philip and Mary, by the grace of God King and Queen of England, [[British claims to the French throne|France]], [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Kings of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Fidei Defensor|Defenders of the Faith]], Princes of [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], Archdukes of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], Dukes of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], Counts of [[Habsburg]], [[Count of Flanders|Flanders]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]]".<ref name="waller">Waller, Maureen.

In the 1584 [[Treaty of Joinville]], he was styled "Philip, by the grace of God second of his name, king of Castille, Leon, Aragon, Portugal, Navarre, Naples, Sicily, Jerusalem, [[King of Majorca|Majorca]], [[King of Sardinia|Sardinia]], and the islands, Indies, and ''[[wikt:terra firma|terra firma]]'' of the [[Ocean Sea]]; archduke of Austria; duke of Burgundy, [[Duke of Lothier|Lothier]], Brabant, [[Duchy of Limbourg|Limbourg]], [[Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Duchy of Guelders|Guelders]], and Milan; Count of Habsburg, Flanders, [[County of Artois|Artois]], and [[County of Burgundy|Burgundy]]; Count Palatine of [[County of Hainaut|Hainault]], [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[County of Zeeland|Zeeland]], [[County of Namur|Namur]], [[Drenthe]], [[Zutphen County|Zutphen]]; prince of "Zvuanem"<!--sic-->; marquis of the Holy Roman Empire; lord of [[Frisia]], [[Salland]], [[Lordship of Mechelen|Mechelen]], and of the [[Ommelanden|cities, towns, and lands]] of [[Lordship of Utrecht|Utrecht]], [[Overissel]], and [[Lordship of Groningen|Groningen]]; master of Asia and Africa".<ref>"[https://books.google.com/books?id=mDPF4ILESaUC&pg=PA226 Treaty of Joinville]". {{fr-icon}} In Davenport, Frances G.

His coinage typically bore the [[obverse]] inscription "<small>PHS·D:G·HISP·Z·REX</small>" (Latin: "Philip, by the grace of God King of Spain et cetera"), followed by the local title of the mint ("<small>DVX·BRA</small>" for Duke of Brabant, "<small>C·HOL</small>" for Count of Holland, "<small>D·TRS·ISSV</small>" for Lord of Overissel, &c.). The [[obverse and reverse|reverse]] would then bear a motto such as "<small>PACE·ET·IVSTITIA</small>" ("For Peace and Justice") or "<small>DOMINVS·MIHI·ADIVTOR</small>" ("[[Epistle to the Hebrews|The Lord is my helper]]").<ref>See, ''inter alia'', "[http://www.maravedis.net/europa_felipe_i_i_amberes.html Amberes]" {{es-icon}} and ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tXSrLbIEDBMC&pg=PA1255 Standard Catalog of World Gold Coins]''.</ref> A medal struck in 1583 bore the inscriptions "<small>PHILIPP II HISP ET NOVI ORBIS REX</small>" ("Philip II, King of Spain and the New World") and "<small>NON SUFFICIT ORBIS</small>" ("The world is not enough").<ref>Cremades, Checa.

==Family==
[[File:Sánchez Coello Royal feast.jpg|thumb|Philip and Anna banqueting with family and courtiers, by [[Alonso Sánchez Coello]]]]
[[File:Cenotafio de Felipe II y su familia.jpg|thumb|Cenotaph of Philip and his family at El Escorial.]]
Philip was married four times and had children with three of his wives.

Philip's first wife was his first cousin, [[Maria Manuela, Princess of Portugal]]. She was a daughter of Philip's maternal uncle, [[John III of Portugal]], and paternal aunt, [[Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal|Catherine of Austria]]. The marriage produced one son in 1545, after which Maria died 4 days later due to haemorrhage:
* [[Carlos, Prince of Asturias]] (8 July 1545 – 24 July 1568), died unmarried and without issue.

Philip's second wife was his first cousin once removed, Queen [[Mary I of England]]. The 1554 marriage to Mary was political. By this marriage, Philip became ''[[jure uxoris]]'' [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] and [[King of Ireland|Ireland]], although the couple was apart more than together as they ruled their respective countries. The marriage produced no children and Mary died in 1558, ending Philip's reign in England and Ireland.

Philip's third wife was [[Elisabeth of Valois]], the eldest daughter of [[Henry II of France]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]]. She was also a distant relation of Philip-she was descended from their mutual ancestor [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile]]. During their marriage (1559–1568) they conceived five daughters, though only two of the girls survived. Elisabeth died a few hours after the loss of her last child. Their children were:
* Miscarried twin daughters (August 1564).
* [[Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain]] (12 August 1566 – 1 December 1633), married [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria]], 
* [[Catherine Michelle of Spain]] (10 October 1567 – 6 November 1597), married [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]], and had issue.
* Miscarried daughter (3 October 1568).

Philip's fourth and final wife was his sororal niece, [[Anna of Austria (1549–1580)|Anna of Austria]]. By contemporary accounts, this was a convivial and satisfactory marriage (1570–1580) for both Philip and Anna. This marriage produced four sons and one daughter. Anna died of heart failure 8 months after giving birth to Maria in 1580. Their children were:
* [[Ferdinand, Prince of Asturias]] (4 December 1571 – 18 October 1578), died young.
* Charles Laurence (12 August 1573 – 30 June 1575), died young.
* [[Diego, Prince of Asturias]] (15 August 1575 – 21 November 1582), died young.
* [[Philip III of Spain]] (3 April 1578 – 31 March 1621).
* Maria (14 February 1580 – 5 August 1583), died young.
