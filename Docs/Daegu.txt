'''Daegu''' ({{IPA-ko|tɛɡu|lang}}), (대구, 大邱, literally 'large hill') formerly spelled '''Taegu'''<!--Before changing the name spelling please see note-->,<ref>This romanization of the city's name is in [[McCune-Reischauer]]. It was used prior to the official adoption of the [[Revised Romanization]] by the South Korean Government in 2000.</ref> and officially known as the '''Daegu Metropolitan City''', is a city in [[South Korea]], the fourth largest after [[Seoul]], [[Busan]], and [[Incheon]], and the third largest metropolitan area in the nation<ref>The 2005 census first found that Incheon's population was larger than Daegu's. Still, the city is considered as one of the three major cities of South Korea, because Incheon belongs to the [[Seoul National Capital Area]].</ref> with over 2.5 million residents. Daegu is the principal city of the surrounding [[North Gyeongsang Province]]. The two areas combined are often referred to as [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk]], with a total population of over 5 million.

Daegu is located in south-eastern Korea about {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=off}} from the seacoast, near the [[Geumho River]] and its mainstream, [[Nakdong River]] in [[Gyeongsang-do]]. The Daegu basin, where the city lies, is the central plain of the [[Yeongnam]] [[List of regions of Korea|region]]. In ancient times, there was a proto-country named [[Jinhan]], to which the current Daegu area belonged. Later Daegu was part of the [[Silla Kingdom]] which unified the [[Korean Peninsula]]. During the [[Joseon Dynasty]] period, the city was the capital of [[Gyeongsang-do]] which was one of the traditional [[Eight Provinces of Korea|eight provinces]] of the country.

Daegu was an economic motor of Korea during the 1960s–1980s period and was especially known for its electronics industry. The humid subtropical climate of Daegu is ideal for producing high quality apples, thus the nickname, "Apple City".<ref>[http://www.eslstarter.com/south-korea-province-guide-daegu.php Guide to Daegu]</ref> Daegu is also known as "Textile City".<ref>[http://www.abcarticledirectory.com/Article/Daegu---The-City-of-Textile-Industry/1669374 Daegu - The City of Textile Industry]</ref> Textile used to be the pillar industry of the city. With the establishment of the [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone]], Daegu is currently focusing on fostering fashion and high-tech industries.

Daegu was the host city of the [[22nd World Energy Congress of 2013]], the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics]] and the [[2003 Summer Universiade]].<ref name="22nd SUMMER UNIVERSIADE">FISU [http://www.fisu.net/en/Daegu-2003-321.html 22nd SUMMER UNIVERSIADE] Retrieved 2011-10-12</ref> It also hosted four matches in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Daegu}}

===Prehistory and early history===
Archaeological investigations in the Greater Daegu area have revealed a large number of settlements and burials of the prehistoric [[Mumun Pottery Period]] (c. 1500–300 B.C.). In fact, some of the earliest evidence of Mumun settlement in Gyeongsangdo have been excavated from Siji-dong and Seobyeon-dong.<ref name="ReferenceA">YUM (Yeungnam University Museum). ''Siji-eui Munhwayujeok VIII: Chwirakji Bonmun'' [Cultural Sites of Siji VIII: Settlement Site Text]. Research Report No. 33. Yeungnam University Museum, Gyeongsan, 1999b.</ref> Dongcheon-dong is one of the substantial Mumun agricultural villages that have been excavated.<ref>YICP (Yongnam Institute of Cultural Properties). ''Daegu Dongcheon-dong Chwirak Yujeok'' [The Settlement Site at Dongcheon-dong, Daegu]. 3 vols. Research Report of Antiquities, Vol. 43. YICP, Daegu, 2002. ISBN 978-89-88226-41-4</ref> The Dongcheon-dong site dates back to the Middle Mumun (c. 850–550 B.C.) and contains the remains of many prehistoric pit-houses and agricultural fields. Megalithic burials (dolmens) have also been found in large numbers in Daegu.

Ancient historical texts indicate that during the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms]] ([[Mahan confederacy|Mahan]], [[Jinhan]] and [[Byeonhan]]) period, Daegu was the site of a chiefdom or walled-town polity known from that time, according to historical records, as [[Dalgubeol]]. It was absorbed into the kingdom of [[Silla]] no later than the fifth century. The vestiges of the wall can be seen, and relics have been excavated in the current [[Dalseong Park]].

===Silla===
[[File:칠곡송림사오층전탑사리장치.jpg|left|thumb|160px|Reliquary from 8th century Silla, [[Daegu National Museum]]]]
Silla succeeded in unifying the Korean peninsula by defeating the other kingdoms of Baekje and Koguryo in the late 7th century, partly thanks to assistance from China's [[Tang Dynasty]]. Shortly thereafter, in 689, Silla's King [[Sinmun of Silla|Sinmun]] considered moving the capital from [[Gyeongju]] to Daegu but was unable to do so.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 76 and Shin (1999).</ref>  This initiative is known only through a single line in the ''[[Samguk Sagi]]'', a most valued historical record of ancient Korea by Koryeo Dynasty historian Kim Bu-sik, but it is presumed that it indicates both an attempt by the Silla king to reinforce royal authority and the entrenched resistance of the Gyeongju political elites that was the likely cause of the move's failure.<ref>Lee (1984) and Shin (1999) both make this assumption.</ref> The city was given its current name in 757.

In the late 1990s archaeologists excavated a large scale fortified Silla site in Dongcheon-dong, Buk-gu.<ref>FPCP (Foundation for the Preservation of Cultural Properties). ''Daegu Chilgok Sam Taekji Munhwayejeok Balguljosa Bogoseo'' [Excavation Report of the Cultural Site at Localities 2 and 3, Building Area 3, Chilgok, Daegu]. 3 vols. Antiquities Research Report 62. FPCP, Gyeongju, 2000.</ref> The site at Locality 2 consists of the remains of 39 raised-floor buildings enclosed by a formidable ditch-and-palisade system. The excavators hypothesize that the fortified site was a permanent military encampment or barracks. Archaeologists also uncovered a large Silla village dating to the 6th to 7th centuries AD at Siji-dong.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Later Three Kingdoms and Goryeo===
During the [[Later Three Kingdoms period]], 892–936, Daegu was initially aligned with [[Hubaekje]]. In 927, northern Daegu was the site of the Battle of Gong Mountain between the forces of [[Goryeo]] under [[Wang Geon]] and those of Hubaekje under [[Gyeon Hwon]]. In this battle, the forces of Goryeo were crushed and Wang Geon himself was saved only by the heroic deed of his general [[Shin Sung-gyeom]]. However, it appears that the atrocities of the Hubaekje forces at this time changed local sympathizers to favor Wang Geon, who later became the king of [[Goryeo]].

Numerous place-names and local legends in the area still bear witness to the historic battle of 927. Among these are "[[Ansim Station|Ansim]]", which literally means "peace of mind", said to be the first place where Wang Geon dared to stop after escaping the battle, and "[[Banwol-dong, Ansan|Banwol]]", or half-moon, where he is said to have stopped and admired the moon before returning to Goryeo. A statue commemorating the battle now stands in northern Daegu, as does a memorial to Sin Sunggyeom.

In the [[Goryeo]] period, the first edition of the ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'' was stored in Daegu, at the temple of Buinsa.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 131.</ref>  However, this edition was destroyed when the temple was sacked in 1254, during the [[Mongol invasions of Korea]].<ref>Lee (1984), p. 149.</ref>

===Joseon===
[[File:Daegu dalseongdo.jpg|thumb|left|Daegu in the 18th century]]
Daegu served as an important transportation center during the Joseon Dynasty. She stands in the mid part of the [[Great Yeongnam Road]] which ran between Seoul and Busan. It lay at the junction of this arterial road and the roads to Gyeongju and [[Jinju]].

In 1601, Daegu became the administrative capital of the [[Gyeongsang-do]], which is current Daegu, [[Busan]], [[Ulsan]], [[Gyeongsangbuk-do]], and [[Gyeongsangnam-do]]. At about that time, the city began to grow into a major city. The status continued for nearly three hundred years. And the city has been transformed as the capital of Gyeongsangbuk-do since Gyeongsang-do was divided into two provinces, Gyeongsangbuk-do (northern Gyeongsang-province) and Gyeongsangnam-do (southern one) in 1896.

Daegu's first regular markets were established during the late Joseon period. The most famous of these is the [[Yangnyeongsi]] herbal medicine market. This became a center of herbal trade in Joseon, and even attracted buyers from neighboring countries. Traders from Japan, who were not permitted to leave the [[Nakdong River]] valley, hired messengers to visit the market on their behalf. [[Seomun Market]] which stood at the city's west gate at that time, was one of the top three markets in the Joseon period.

===Korean Empire and Colonial rule===
The Korean hermit kingdom finally opened herself to the outside world in the late 19th century. In 1895, Daegu became the site of one of the country's first modern [[post office]]s, as a part of the 'Gab-o' reforms introduced in the aftermath of the Sino-Japanese war.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 294.</ref>

Beginning in the late 1890s, increasing number of foreign merchants and workers started to visit Daegu, which emerged as a modern transportation center of the newly constructed [[Gyeongbu Line]] main railroad connecting Seoul and Busan.

In 1905, the old fortress wall was forcibly destroyed. The wall still survives only in the street names such as the streets [[Dongseongno]] and [[Bukseongno]], "east fortress street" and "north fortress street", which now run where the wall once stood.

[[Independence movement]]s against imperial aggressions were outstanding in Daegu. These began as early as 1898, when a branch of the [[Independence Club]] was opened in the town.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 302.</ref>  As the demise of the [[Korean Empire]] approached in 1907, local citizens led by [[Seo Sang-don]] organized the [[National Debt Repayment Movement]]. The movement spread nationwide, although it fell short of repaying the national debt through individual donations. Freedom fighting continued after the 1910 annexation, notably during the [[March 1st movement]] of 1919. At that time, four major demonstrations took place in Daegu, involving an estimated 23,000 peace-loving citizens.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 343.</ref>

===Partition===
Despite the glorious liberation in 1945, Daegu turned into a hotbed of unrest. In 1946, the [[Daegu October Incident]] took place, one of the most serious social disorder after the foundation of the Republic of Korea.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 377.</ref> An operation by the Korean national police to take control of rioters on October 1 resulted in the death of three student demonstrators and injuries to many others, sparking a massive counter-attack killing as many as 38 policemen.<ref>[http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/412/23267 Green Left – Features: HISTORICAL FEATURE: The Korean War – a war of counter-revolution<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It was also the site of major demonstrations on February 28, 1960, prior to the fraudulent [[South Korean presidential election of 1960|presidential election]] of that year.<ref>Lee (1984), p. 384.</ref>

Daegu and all of North Gyeongsang province saw heavy guerrilla activities in the late 1940s, as thousands of refugees shied away from the fighting in Jeolla province and sought shelters in Daegu.<ref>Cumings (1997), pp. 243–244.</ref>  In November 1948, a unit in Daegu joined the mutiny which had begun in [[Yeosu]] the previous month.<ref>Nahm (1996), p. 379.</ref>

During the [[Korean War]], much heavy fighting occurred nearby along the [[Nakdong River]]. Daegu sat inside the [[Pusan Perimeter]], however, and therefore remained in South Korean hands throughout the war. As in many other areas during the Korean War, [[political killing]]s of dissenters were widespread. A large series of engagements were fought around the city to prevent North Korean troops from crossing the Nakdong, the [[Battle of Taegu]].

In the second half of the twentieth century, the city underwent explosive growth, and the population has increased more than tenfold since the end of the Korean War. The city was politically favored during the 18-year-long rule of [[Park Chung-hee]], when it and the surrounding area served as his political base. Daegu champions conservative political ideas and movements today. Daegu is a political base for the ruling [[Saenuri Party]].

In the 1980s, Daegu separated from Gyeongsangbuk-do and became a separately administered provincial-level [[Special cities of South Korea|Directly Governed City]] (''Jikhalsi''), and was redesignated as a [[Special cities of South Korea|Metropolitan City]] (''Gwangyeoksi'') in 1995. Today, Daegu is the 3rd largest [[metropolitan area]] in Korea with respect to both population and commerce.

==Politics==
[[File:Daegu city hall context.jpg|thumb|right|Daegu City Hall]]
There are two local governments in the city, the Daegu Metropolitan Government in [[Jung District, Daegu|Jung District]] and Gyeongbuk Provincial Government in [[Buk District, Daegu|Buk District]]. The provincial government will be relocated to [[Andong]] in its proper province, Gyeongbuk. The mayor and heads of city's eight districts are directly elected by the citizens every four years. The city council has twenty nine members which consist of twenty six from the same number of electoral districts and three proportional representations. They are also directly elected every four years. Most of them are the members of the [[Saenuri Party]], the main [[Conservatism|conservative]] political party in South Korea. Daegu is the home to the party and has produced two Presidents of the Republic of Korea thus far: [[Roh Tae-woo]] and [[Park Geun-hye]]. As the capital of the Korean conservatives, the city has wielded strong political influence in [[Elections in South Korea|elections]].

===Administrative divisions===
[[File:00-daegu-en.svg|400px|thumb|Administrative divisions]]
{{Main|List of districts and county of Daegu}}
Daegu is divided into 7 districts (''Gu'') and 1 county (''Gun'')
*[[Jung District, Daegu|Jung District]] (중구, 中區) – ''means the central district.''
*[[Dong District, Daegu|Dong District]] (동구, 東區) – ''means the east district.''
*[[Seo District, Daegu|Seo District]] (서구, 西區) – ''means the west district.''
*[[Nam District, Daegu|Nam District]] (남구, 南區) – ''means the south district.''
*[[Buk District, Daegu|Buk District]] (북구, 北區) – ''means the north district.''

==Geography==

===Topography===
Daegu sits in a basin surrounded by low mountains. [[Palgongsan]] to the north, [[Biseulsan]] to the south, Waryongsan to the west, and a series of smaller hills in the east. The [[Geumho River]] flows along the northern and eastern edges of the city, emptying in the Nakdong River west of the city.

===Climate===
The mountains that comprise the basin trap hot and humid air. Similarly, in winter, cold air lies in the basin. The area receives little precipitation except during the rainy season of summer, and is sunny throughout much of the year. Data gathered since 1961 indicates that the mean temperature for January, the coldest month in Daegu, is {{convert|0.6|°C|0|abbr=on}} and that for August, the warmest month, is {{convert|26.4|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The City's lowest record temperature was {{convert|−20.2|°C|0|abbr=on}},<ref>[http://www.kma.go.kr/weather/climate/extreme_daily.jsp?type=min_temp&mm=1&x=21&y=1 기후자료극값 1월 일최저기온, 대구(143)]</ref> and the City's highest record temperature was {{convert|40.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://www.kma.go.kr/weather/climate/extreme_daily.jsp?type=max_temp&mm=8&x=10&y=5 기후자료극값 8월 일최고기온, 대구(143)]</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Daegu Metro Line 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Daegu Metro Line 3]].]]
Daegu is a manufacturing industry city. The major industries are [[textile]]s, [[metal]]s and [[machinery]]. In the year 2010, Daegu had a regional GDP of $45,387 million with 7.2% real GDP growth rate. The GDP per capita though is well below Korea national average. The quality of the [[apple]]s grown around the city is renowned around Korea . Many companies such as [[Daegu Bank]], [[Korea Delphi]], [[Hwasung corp.]], and [[TaeguTec]] are situated in this city, and [[Samsung]] and [[Kolon]] were founded here. Numerous factories are located in the industrial complexes situated in the west and north sides of the city including the Seongseo Industrial Complex, West Daegu Industrial Complex and the Daegu Dyeing Industrial Complex.

The city is the economic and industrial core of the [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk]] region, one of the major industrial areas in Korea. It accounted for as much as 94 percent of Korea's trade surplus in 2006.<ref>{{ko icon}} http://www.yeongnam.co.kr/Pdf/2007/03/17/120101-17032007999.pdf The Yeongnam Ilbo (2007-03-17)</ref> The electronics industries in [[Gumi, Gyeongsangbuk-do|Gumi]] and the steel industries in [[Pohang]] provided great services to that surplus. World-leading manufacturing facilities for [[Anycall]] ([[Samsung Mobile]]) and [[POSCO]]'s main factories are located near the city. Daegu and its neighbouring cities were designated for the [[Daegu-Gyeongbuk Free Economic Zone]] by the central government in 2008. It is specialized companies like Winitech software company in knowledge-based service and manufacturing industries.

Historically, Daegu has been the commercial center of the southern part of the [[Korean Peninsula]] with [[Seoul]] in the center and [[Pyongyang]] in the north (currently [[North Korea]]), because of its advantageous location. Some of the large, traditional markets like [[Seomun Market]] are still flourishing in the city.

Additionally, Daegu was considered the third major economic city in Korea, after Seoul and Busan. However, due to the decline of the textile industry, which is the heart of Daegu's economy, the overall economic growth of the city has also fallen.

Also, the city is the warmest region in South Korea due to the humid subtropical climate. This climate condition provides the region with high quality apples and oriental melons. The fruit industry is a crucial support for the local economy. Due to the stagnant economy, Daegu’s population began to decrease after 2003. Recently, the local government has begun focusing on working towards economic revival and concentrating on improving the city’s fashion industry.

===Fashion industry===
Beginning in the late 1990s, Daegu has been actively making efforts to promote its [[fashion]] industry based on its textile and [[clothing]] manufacturing industries under the 'Daegu: Fashion City'. The city opens many exhibitions related to the fashion and textile industries including the [http://www.fashiondaegu.com/eng/index.asp Daegu Fashion Fair] and [http://www.previewin.com/ Preview in Daegu] annually or semi-annually, and invites national institutes. A large new town specializing in the textile-fashion industries is currently under construction in Bongmu-dong, northeastern Daegu. The district, officially named Esiapolis, takes aim at the fashion hub of East Asia. Textile complexes, textile-fashion institutions, an international school, fashion malls as well as residential areas plan to be developed in the district.<ref>{{ko icon}} http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2009/11/24/2009112401092.html The Chosun Ilbo (2009-11-25)</ref>

==Culture and sightseeing==
Generally Daegu is known as a conservative city. As well as being the largest inland city in the country beside Seoul it has become one of the major metropolitan areas in the nation. Traditionally, [[Buddhism]] has been strong; today there are still many temples. [[Korean Confucianism|Confucianism]] is also popular in Daegu, with a large academy based in the city. Neon cross-topped spires of Christian churches can also be seen in the city.

===Sights===
The most well-known sight of the city is the stone Buddha called [[Gatbawi]] on the top of Gwanbong, [[Palgongsan]]. It is famous for its stone [[Gat (hat)|gat]] (Korean traditional hat). People from all over the country visit the place, because they believe that the Buddha will grant one's single desire. Administratively, the site itself is located in the neighboring city, [[Gyeongsan]], [[Gyeongbuk]].

[[File:Donghwasa Temple.jpg|thumb|left|Scenery of [[Donghwasa]]]]
On the outskirts of the city, mountains keep many traditional and renowned temples such as [[Donghwasa]], [[Pagyesa]], and [[Buinsa]] ("-''sa''" means temple). Donghwasa itself dates from the [[Silla]] period, and many artifacts of the period are found around the temple in northern Daegu. Some lecture halls or memorial halls such as Dodong-seowon (도동서원, 道東書院) and Nokdong-seowon (녹동서원, 鹿洞書院) are also located in the suburbs. Those places have served as resting places for the citizens mentally and physically. The old villages such as the [[Otgol village]] (''Gyeongju Choi'' clan's original residence area) and the Inheung village (''Nampyeong Mun'''s) rarely remain.

In the urban area, the [[Joseon Dynasty]]'s administrative or educational buildings including [[Gyeongsang-gamyeong]] (경상감영, 慶尙監營) and [[Daegu-hyanggyo]] (대구향교, 大邱鄕校) remain. The main gateway of the city in that period called [[Yeongnam-jeilmun]] (영남제일문, 嶺南第一門, means the first gateway in [[Yeongnam]]) is restored in Mangudang Park, east of Daegu.

Western style modern architectures like [[Gyesan Cathedral]] and the old building of Jeil Church are preserved in many places of the urban area. Gyesan Cathedral is the third oldest gothic church building in Korea<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tour.daegu.go.kr/best/best_list.php?mods=view&menu_mst_cd=0001&menu_slv_cd=0001&tour_mst_cd=000013&menu=01&page=1 |title=대구광역시 관광문화정보시스템 – 계산성당 |publisher=Daegu Metropolitan City |accessdate=2009-11-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> and the cathedral of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Daegu]] which is one of [[Roman Catholicism in South Korea|three archdioceses in South Korea]]. Several buildings, in the present [[Keisung Academy]] and the [[Kyungpook National University|KNU]] middle/high school, are famous too.

[[Yangnyeongsi]] (약령시, 藥令市) in Namseongno (often called Yakjeon-golmok) is the oldest market for Korean medicinal herbs in the country with a history of 350 years. Bongsan-dong which has some art galleries and studios is being developed as the artistic center of the city since the 1990s.

Nearby tourist attractions include [[Haeinsa]]—a [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] temple that houses the ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'' (a woodblock edition of the ''[[Tripitaka]]'' and one of the world's oldest extant complete collections of the Buddhist scriptures). Haeinsa is located in Gayasan National Park of [[Hapcheon]], [[Gyeongnam]]. The historic city of [[Gyeongju]], [[Gyeongbuk]], the capital of the ancient kingdom of [[Silla]] is located east of Daegu.

===Mountains and parks===
{{See also|List of parks in Daegu}}
[[File:Dalgubeol Grand Bell in Daegu.jpg|thumb|right|Dalgubeol-daejong, a city bell at the Gukchae Bosang Park]]
[[File:Daegu Botanical Garden Bridge.jpg|thumb|Daegu Botanical Garden bridge]]
Mt.Palgong, Mt.Biseul, and Mt.Ap are the representative mountains in Daegu. Apsan, just in the southern part of the city, is the closest mountain from the urban area among them. It has many trails, [[Korean Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples, a Korean War museum, and a gondola ride to the peak. Additionally, Waryongsan, Hamjisan, and Yongjibong are located in the city. These serve as neighborhood parks to the citizens.

In the urban area, several small mountains and hills play the same role. Dalseong Park, which sits inside a 1,500-year-old earth fortress, is a historic place of the city. It contains the city's only [[zoo]] and some monuments as well as the wall. [[Duryu Park]] or Duryusan is a large forest in the middle of the urban area. It has [[Daegu Tower]], [[Woobang Land]], Kolon Bandstand, Duryu Stadium, and many sports facilities. Daegu Tower, also called Woobang Tower or Duryu Tower, is the tallest contemporary structure (202 m) and a symbol of the city. Its observatory commands good views of the surroundings. Woobang Land is the largest amusement park out of the capital area. Many small gardens lie in the heart of the city, such as the National Debt Repayment Movement Memorial Park (Gukchae Bosang Park) and 2·28 Park. The former park includes Dalgubeol-daejong (달구벌대종, 達句伐大鐘, which means the Dalgubeol grand bell. The bell is struck every week and year. There is also a botanical garden with a variety of plants and flowers.

===Downtown and shopping===

[[Dongseongno]] (동성로, 東城路) is the downtown of Daegu lying from the [[Daegu Station]] to ''Jungang pachulso'' (central police station) near the Banwoldang subway station in the center of the city [[Jung-gu, Daegu|Jung-gu]]. It has the Jungangno subway station as the nearest station from its heart. Like its name meaning the street in the east fortress, the eastern part of [[Daegu-eupseong]] (대구읍성, 大邱邑城, means the Daegu-Principality Fortress) was situated along this street. The fortress, however, had been demolished in the early 20th century. Although Daegu is the nation's third or fourth largest city, the Dongseongno area form the largest and the broadest downtown area in the whole country except the capital city, [[Seoul]].  In most cases, famous brands open their branch shop first here out of the Greater Seoul area.<ref>{{ko icon}} http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20090210026021 The Seoul Shinmun (2009-02-10)</ref>

[[File:Seomun gate and traffic.jpg|thumb|right|The sign of the [[Seomun Market]]]]
Sub-downtowns in the city have its own commercial powers and colors. The area around the Seongseo Industrial Complex subway station in [[Dalseo-gu]] is a concentration of many amusement spots, and young people easily can be seen around [[Kyungpook National University]] in [[Buk-gu, Daegu|Buk-gu]]. ''Deuran-gil'' (means the street inside the field) in [[Suseong-gu]] is known for many restaurants.

The city has a number of department stores. Many of these belong to national or multinational chains, but the local [[Daegu Department Store]] also operates two branches, while another local chain, [[Donga Department Store]] operates four in the city proper. The six department stores among them gather at the downtown. The traditional markets such as [[Seomun Market]] and Chilseong Market sell all sorts of goods.

===Festivals===
Many traditional ceremonies and festivals in agrarian society disappeared in the process of modernization. A Confucian ritual ceremony called ''Seokjeondaeje'' is held at Daegu-hyanggyo every spring and autumn. The Yangnyeongsi herb medical festival and Otgol village festival are the contemporary festivals about traditional culture.

Lately in the city, enthusiasm about performing arts is growing and the local government is trying to meet its demand. [[Daegu International Opera Festival]] (DIOF) in October since 2003, [[Daegu International Musical Festival]] (DIMF), and [[Daegu International Bodypainting Festival]] (DIBF) are three of the most famous festivals on each field in Korea, although those have short histories.

Various festivals in various themes like the Colorful Daegu Festival, [[Dongseongno]] festival, [[Palgongsan]] maple festival, [[Biseulsan]] azalea festival, Korea in Motion Daegu, and so on, are held by the city, each ward, or the specific groups, all through the year.

On August 25 through August 31, 2008, Daegu hosted the first ever Asian Bodypainting Festival, a sister event of the [[World Bodypainting Festival]] in [[Seeboden]], [[Austria]].
