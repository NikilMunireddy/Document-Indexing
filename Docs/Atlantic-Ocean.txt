The '''Atlantic Ocean''' is the second largest of the world's [[ocean]]ic divisions, following the [[Pacific Ocean]]. With a total [[area]] of about {{convert|106,400,000|km2|sqmi}},<ref name="brit">"The New Encyclopædia Britannica", Volume 2, Encyclopædia Britannica, 1974. p. 294</ref> it covers approximately 20 percent of the [[Earth's surface]] and about 29 percent of its [[water]] surface area. Its name refers to [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] of [[Greek mythology]], making the Atlantic the "Sea of Atlas".

The oldest known mention of "Atlantic" is in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' of [[Herodotus]] around 450 BC (Hdt. 1.202.4): ''Atlantis thalassa'' (Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς θάλασσα; English: Sea of Atlas). The term Ethiopic Ocean, derived from [[Ethiopia]], was applied to the southern Atlantic as late as the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite book|author1=George Ripley|author2=Charles Anderson Dana|title=The American cyclopaedia: a popular dictionary of general knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ROQXAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA69|accessdate=15 April 2011|year=1873|publisher=Appleton|pages=69–}}</ref> Before Europeans discovered other oceans, their term "ocean" was synonymous with the waters beyond the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] that are now known as the Atlantic. The early Greeks believed this ocean to be a [[Oceanus|gigantic river encircling the world]].

The Atlantic Ocean occupies an elongated, S-shaped basin extending longitudinally between [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]] to the east, and the [[Americas]] to the west. As one component of the interconnected [[World Ocean|global ocean]], it is connected in the north to the [[Arctic Ocean]], to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the southwest, the [[Indian Ocean]] in the southeast, and the [[Southern Ocean]] in the south (other definitions describe the Atlantic as extending southward to [[Antarctica]]). The [[equator]] subdivides it into the '''North Atlantic Ocean''' and '''South Atlantic Ocean'''.

==Geography==
[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|250px|The Atlantic Ocean as seen from the western coast of [[Portugal]]|alt=Photo of surf breaking on rocky shore]]

The Atlantic Ocean is bounded on the west by North and South America. It connects to the Arctic Ocean through the [[Denmark Strait]], [[Greenland Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]] and [[Barents Sea]]. To the east, the boundaries of the ocean proper are [[Europe]]: the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (where it connects with the [[Mediterranean Sea]]–one of its [[marginal sea]]s–and, in turn, the [[Black Sea]], both of which also touch upon [[Asia]]) and Africa.

In the southeast, the Atlantic merges into the Indian Ocean. The [[20th meridian east|20° East meridian]], running south from [[Cape Agulhas]] to [[Antarctica]] defines its border. Some authorities show it extending south to Antarctica, while others show it bounded at the [[60th parallel south|60° parallel]] by the Southern Ocean.<ref>[http://iodeweb5.vliz.be/oceanteacher/index.php?module=contextview&action=contextdownload&id=gen11Srv32Nme37_366 ''Limits of Oceans and Seas'']. International Hydrographic Organization Special Publication No. 23, 1953.</ref>

In the southwest, the [[Drake Passage]] connects it to the Pacific Ocean. The [[wikt:man-made|man-made]] [[Panama Canal]] links the Atlantic and Pacific. Besides those mentioned, other large bodies of water that form part of the Atlantic are the [[Caribbean Sea]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Hudson Bay]], the Mediterranean Sea, the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic Sea]], and the [[Celtic Sea]].

Covering approximately 22% of Earth's surface, the Atlantic is second in size to the Pacific. With its adjacent seas, it occupies an area of about {{convert|106400000|km2|sqmi}};<ref name="brit" /> without them, it has an area of {{convert|82400000|km2|sqmi}}. The land that drains into the Atlantic covers four times that of either the Pacific or Indian oceans. The volume of the Atlantic with its adjacent seas is 354,700,000&nbsp;cubic kilometers (85,100,000&nbsp;[[cubic mile|cu mi]]) and without them 323,600,000&nbsp;cubic kilometres (77,640,000&nbsp;cu mi).

The average depth of the Atlantic with its adjacent seas, is {{convert|3339|m|fathom ft|lk=out}}; without them it is {{convert|3926|m|fathom ft}}.<ref>Amanda Briney, {{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/od/locateplacesworldwide/tp/fiveoceans.htm | title = Geography of the World's Oceans |publisher = About Education |accessdate=2015-05-22}}</ref> The greatest depth, [[Milwaukee Deep]] with {{convert|8380|m|fathom ft}}, is in the [[Puerto Rico Trench]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

[[File:Myrtle-Beach-SC-0799.jpg|thumb|right|[[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]] view of the Atlantic Ocean.]]
The Atlantic Ocean was named by the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] after either [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas the Titan]] or the [[Atlas Mountains]] named for him;<ref name="MWU">{{Citation | author = Merriam-Webster | authorlink = Merriam-Webster | title = Merriam-Webster Unabridged | publisher = Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}</ref><ref name="AHD5">{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |authorlink=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |edition=5th |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=http://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}</ref> both involve the concept of holding up the sky. [[Transatlantic crossing|Transatlantic travel]] played a major role in the expansion of Western civilization into the Americas. It is the Atlantic that separates the "[[Old World]]" from the "[[New World]]".

In [[modern history|modern times]], some [[idiom]]s refer to the ocean in a humorously diminutive way as '''the Pond''', describing both the geographical and cultural divide between North America and Europe, in particular between the English-speaking nations of both continents. Many Irish or British people refer to the United States and Canada as "across the pond", and vice versa.<ref>Example: BBC Click – Episode 4 April 2009</ref>

The "Black Atlantic" refers to the role of this ocean in shaping black people's history, especially through the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Irish migration to the US is meant when the term "The Green Atlantic" is used. The term "Red Atlantic" has been used in reference to the Marxian concept of an Atlantic working class, as well as to the Atlantic experience of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous Americans]].

==Ocean floor==
[[File:Atlantic bathymetry.jpg|thumb|Atlantic [[bathymetry]]|[[False color]] map of ocean depth in the Atlantic basin]]
The principal feature of the [[bathymetry]] (bottom [[topography]]) is a [[Mid-ocean ridge|submarine mountain range]] called the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Kenneth J. Hsü| title = The Challenger at Sea: A Ship That Revolutionized Earth Science| year = 1992| isbn = 978-0-691-08735-1| page = 57 }}</ref> It extends from [[Iceland]] in the north to approximately [[58th parallel south|58° South latitude]], reaching a maximum width of about {{convert|860|nmi|km mi|-1}}. A great [[rift valley]] also extends along the ridge over most of its length. The depth of water at the apex of the ridge is less than {{convert|2700|m|fathom ft}} in most places, while the bottom of the ridge is three times as deep. Several peaks rise above the water and form islands.<ref>{{cite book| author = Kenneth J. Hsü| title = The Mediterranean Was a Desert: A Voyage of the Glomar Challenger| year = 1987| isbn = 978-0-691-02406-6}}</ref> The South Atlantic Ocean has an additional submarine ridge, the [[Walvis Ridge]].<ref>National Geographic Atlas of the World: Revised Sixth Edition, National Geographic Society, 1992</ref>

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge separates the Atlantic Ocean into two large [[trough (geology)|troughs]] with depths from {{convert|3700|-|5500|m|fathom ft}}. Transverse ridges running between the continents and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge divide the ocean floor into numerous basins. Some of the larger basins are the [[Blake Basin|Blake]], Guiana, North American, Cape Verde, and Canaries basins in the North Atlantic. The largest South Atlantic basins are the Angola, Cape, Argentina, and Brazil basins.

The deep ocean floor is thought to be fairly flat with occasional deeps, [[abyssal plains]], [[oceanic trench|trenches]], [[seamount]]s, [[Oceanic basin|basins]], [[Oceanic plateau|plateaus]], [[Submarine canyon|canyons]], and some [[guyot]]s. Various shelves along the margins of the continents constitute about 11% of the bottom topography with few deep channels cut across the continental rise.

Ocean floor trenches and seamounts:
* [[Puerto Rico Trench]], in the North Atlantic, is the deepest trench at {{convert|8605|m|fathom ft}}<ref>[http://www.sea-seek.com/site/Milwaukee_Deep Milwaukee Deep]. sea-seek.com</ref>
* [[Laurentian Abyss]] is found off the eastern coast of [[Canada]]
* [[South Sandwich Trench]] reaches a depth of {{convert|8428|m|fathom ft}}
* [[Romanche Trench]] is located near the [[equator]] and reaches a depth of about {{convert|7454|m|fathom ft}}.

Ocean [[sediment]]s are composed of:
* [[Terrigenous]] deposits with land origins, consisting of sand, mud, and rock particles formed by [[erosion]], [[weathering]], and volcanic activity on land washed to sea. These materials are found mostly on the [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and are thickest near large river mouths or off desert coasts.
* [[Pelagic]] deposits, which contain the remains of organisms that sink to the ocean floor, include red clays and [[Globigerina]], [[pteropod]], and siliceous oozes. Covering most of the ocean floor and ranging in thickness from {{convert|60|-|3300|m|fathom ft}} they are thickest in the convergence belts, notably at the [[Hamilton Ridge]] and in upwelling zones.
* [[Authigenic]] deposits consist of such materials as [[manganese nodule]]s. They occur where sedimentation proceeds slowly or where currents sort the deposits, such as in the [[Hewett Curve]].

==Water characteristics==

[[File:Circulacion termohalina.jpg|Path of the [[thermohaline circulation]]. Purple paths represent deep-water currents, while blue paths represent surface currents.|thumb|alt=Map displaying a looping line with arrows indicating that water flows eastward in the far Southern ocean, angling north east of Australia, turning sough after passing Alaska, then crossing the mid-Pacific to flow north of Australia, continuing west below Africa, then turning northwest until reaching eastern Canada, then angling east to southern Europe, then finally turning south just below Greenland and flowing down the Americas' eastern coast, and resuming its flow eastward to complete the circle]]

The second is between eastern Australia and western South America. The third is between Japan and western North America. Of the two in the Atlantic, one is in hemisphere.]]
On average, the Atlantic is the saltiest major ocean; surface water [[salinity]] in the open ocean ranges from 33 to 37 parts per thousand (3.3 – 3.7%) by mass and varies with latitude and season. Evaporation, precipitation, river inflow and [[sea ice]] melting influence surface salinity values. Although the lowest salinity values are just north of the equator (because of heavy tropical rainfall), in general the lowest values are in the high latitudes and along coasts where large rivers enter. Maximum salinity values occur at about [[25th parallel north|25° north]] and [[25th parallel south|south]], in [[subtropical]] regions with low rainfall and high evaporation.

Surface water temperatures, which vary with latitude, current systems, and season and reflect the latitudinal distribution of solar energy, range from below {{convert|-2|C|F}} to over {{convert|30|C|F}}. Maximum temperatures occur north of the equator, and minimum values are found in the polar regions. In the middle latitudes, the area of maximum temperature variations, values may vary by {{convert|7|–|8|C-change|F-change}}.

The Atlantic Ocean consists of four major water masses. The North and South Atlantic central waters make up the surface. The sub-Antarctic intermediate water extends to depths of {{convert|1000|m|fathom ft}}. The [[North Atlantic Deep Water]] reaches depths of as much as {{convert|4000|m|fathom ft}}. The [[Antarctic Bottom Water]] occupies ocean basins at depths greater than 4,000 meters.

Within the North Atlantic, ocean currents isolate the [[Sargasso Sea]], a large elongated body of water, with above average salinity. The Sargasso Sea contains large amounts of [[seaweed]] and is also the spawning ground for both the [[European eel]] and the [[American eel]].

The [[Coriolis effect]] circulates North Atlantic water in a clockwise direction, whereas South Atlantic water circulates counter-clockwise. The south [[tide]]s in the Atlantic Ocean are semi-diurnal; that is, two high tides occur during each 24 lunar hours. In latitudes above [[40th parallel north|40° North]] some east-west oscillation occurs.

==Climate==
[[File:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|thumb|right|Waves in the [[trade winds]] in the Atlantic Ocean—areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the atmosphere that may lead to the formation of hurricanes.|alt=Map of Caribbean showing seven approximately parallel westward-pointing arrows that extend from east of the Virgin Islands to Cuba. The southern arrows bend northward just east of the Dominican Republic before straightening out again.]]

Climate is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as winds. Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.

The oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.

The [[Gulf Stream]] and its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], for example, warms the atmosphere of the British Isles and north-western Europe and influences weather and climate as far south as the northern Mediterranean. The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] area) and Africa's north-western coast. In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas. [[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] develop in the southern part of the North Atlantic Ocean. More local particular weather examples could be found in examples such as the [[Azores High]], [[Benguela Current]], and [[Nor'easter]].

==History==
{{main category|History of the Atlantic Ocean}}
[[File:Pangea animation 03.gif|thumb|Animation showing the separation of [[Pangaea]], which formed the Atlantic Ocean known today|alt=Animation showing the continents separating from a single mass, making creating the Atlantic in the process]]
The Atlantic Ocean appears to be the second youngest of the five oceans. It did not exist prior to 130 million years ago, when the continents that formed from the breakup of the ancestral super continent [[Pangaea]] were drifting apart.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The Atlantic has been extensively explored since the earliest settlements along its shores.

The [[Norsemen]], the [[Portuguese Discoveries|Portuguese]] and the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] were the first to explore and to cross it systematically, from Europe to the Americas, as well as to its islands and archipelagos, and from the North Atlantic to the South Atlantic. It was after the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|voyages]] of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1492, at the service of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] (later Spain), that the Americas became well known in Europe and European exploration rapidly accelerated, leading to many new trade routes and the [[colonization of the Americas]].

As a result, the Atlantic became and remains the major artery between Europe and the [[Americas]] (known as transatlantic trade). Scientific explorations include the [[Challenger expedition]], the [[German Meteor expedition]], [[Columbia University]]'s [[Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory]] and the [[United States Navy Hydrographic Office]].

===Notable crossings===
[[File:RaII.InMuseum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ra II]], a ship built from [[papyrus]], was successfully sailed across the Atlantic by [[Thor Heyerdahl]] proving that it was possible to cross the Atlantic from Africa using such boats in early epochs of history.]]
*Around 600 - 400 BC, [[Hanno the Navigator]] explored West Africa and possibly reached and crossed the Gulf of Guinea and the [[Equator]].         
*Around 980 – 982, [[Erik the Red]]  discovered [[Greenland]], geographically and geologically a part of the Americas.
* In the year 1000, the [[Iceland]]er [[Leif Ericson]] was the first European to set foot on North American soil, corresponding to today's Eastern coast of Canada, i.e., the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], including the area of land named "[[Vinland]]" by Ericson. The [[Vikings|Norse]] discovery was documented in the 13th century [[Icelandic Sagas]] and was corroborated by recent [[L'Anse aux Meadows|L'Anse aux Meadows archeological evidence]].
* Around 1010, [[Thorfinn Karlsefni|Thorfinnr Karlsefni]] led an attempted [[Norsemen]] settlement in North America with 160 settlers, but was later driven off by the natives. His son [[Snorri Thorfinnsson]] was the first American born (somewhere between 1010 and 1013) to European (Icelandic) immigrant parents.
* In 1419 and 1427, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese navigators]] reached [[Madeira]] and [[Azores]], respectively.
* From 1415 to 1488, Portuguese navigators explored the Western African coast, crossed the Equator, and reached the '''South Atlantic''', the [[Southern Hemisphere]], and the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in the southern tip of Africa, entering the Indian Ocean.
* In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] crossed the Atlantic Ocean and landed on the [[Bahamas]], [[Cuba]] and [[Hispaniola]]. He made three additional voyages over the next few years, during which he explored the [[Caribbean]] coast from [[Honduras]] to [[Venezuela]] as well as numerous Caribbean islands. These explorations, along with Columbus's attempts to establish a permanent settlement on [[Hispaniola]], led to the European colonization of the Americas and a period of [[Columbian Exchange]] that permanently altered human cultures and the environment on both sides of the Atlantic. The establishment of the [[Spanish treasure fleet|first transatlantic trade route]] provided a significant source of revenue to the [[Crown of Castile]], leading to the development of the [[Spanish Empire]]. [[Communicable diseases]], unintentionally brought from the [[Old World]] to the [[New World]] by Europeans, devastated the [[Amerindian]] populations, causing the deaths of an estimated 80-95% of the native population of the Americas within 150 years of Columbus's arrival.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nunn|first1=Nathan|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|title=The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=2010|volume=24|issue=2|pages=163–188|doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.163|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25703506?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents}}</ref> Columbus also hoped to enslave the native residents of Hispaniola and transport them to Europe;<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zinn|first1=Howard|title=The Zinn Reader: Writings on Disobedience and Democracy|date=2011|publisher=Seven Stories Press|location=New York|isbn=9781583229460|page=516}}</ref> although unsuccessful in this endeavor, his efforts marked the beginning of the [[transatlantic slave trade]] that displaced an estimated 11-20 million people from Africa to the Americas over the next several centuries.<ref>{{cite web|last1=M’bokolo|first1=Elikia|title=The impact of the slave trade on Africa|url=http://mondediplo.com/1998/04/02africa|website=Le Monde diplomatique}}</ref>

==Economy==
The Atlantic has contributed significantly to the development and economy of surrounding countries. Besides major transatlantic transportation and communication routes, the Atlantic offers abundant [[petroleum]] deposits in the [[sedimentary rock]]s of the continental shelves. The Atlantic hosts the world's richest [[fishing]] resources, especially in the waters covering the shelves. The major fish are [[cod]], [[haddock]], [[hake]], [[herring]], and [[mackerel]].

The most productive areas include the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]], the [[Nova Scotia]] shelf, [[Georges Bank]] off [[Cape Cod]], the [[Bahama Banks]], the waters around Iceland, the [[Irish Sea]], the [[Dogger Bank]] of the North Sea, and the Falkland Banks. [[Eel]], [[lobster]], and [[whale]]s appear in great quantities. Various international treaties attempt to reduce pollution caused by environmental threats such as oil spills, [[marine debris]], and the [[incineration]] of toxic wastes at sea. <!-- This would be good if it were in an infobox

'''Climate:'''
Tropical cyclones ([[hurricane]]s) develop anywhere from off the coast of Africa near [[Cape Verde]] to the [[Windward Islands]] and move westward into the Caribbean Sea or up the east coast of [[North America]]; hurricanes can occur from May to December but are most frequent from late July to early November. Storms are common in the North Atlantic during northern winters, making ocean crossings more difficult and dangerous.

==Terrain==
From October to June the surface is usually covered with sea ice in the [[Labrador Sea]], [[Denmark Strait]], and Baltic Sea. A clockwise warm-water [[gyre]] occupies the northern Atlantic, and a counter-clockwise warm-water gyre appears in the southern Atlantic. The [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin, first discovered by the [[Challenger Expedition]] dominates the ocean floor. This was formed by the vulcanism that also formed the ocean floor and the islands rising from it.

The Atlantic has irregular coasts indented by numerous bays, gulfs, and seas. These include the [[Norwegian Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]], [[North Sea]], [[Labrador Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], [[Bay of Fundy]], [[Gulf of Maine]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], and [[Caribbean Sea]].

[[List of islands in the Atlantic Ocean|Islands]] include [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (including hundreds of surrounding islands), [[Greenland]], [[Iceland]], [[Faroe Islands]], [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Rockall]], [[Sable Island]], [[Azores]], [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]], [[Madeira]], [[Bermuda]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Caribbean Islands]] (including [[Greater Antilles]], [[Leeward Islands]], [[Windward Islands]], [[Leeward Antilles]]), [[Cape Verde]], [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], [[Annobón Province]], [[Fernando de Noronha]], [[Rocas Atoll]], [[Ascension Island]], [[Saint Helena]], [[Trindade and Martim Vaz]], [[Tristan da Cunha]], [[Gough Island]] (Also known as Diego Alvarez), [[Falkland Islands]], [[Tierra del Fuego]], [[South Georgia Island]], [[South Sandwich Islands]], and [[Bouvet Island]].

===Natural resources===
The Atlantic harbors [[petroleum]] and [[gas]] fields, [[fish]], [[marine mammal]]s ([[Pinniped|seals]] and whales), [[sand]] and [[gravel]] aggregates, [[placer deposit]]s, [[polymetallic nodules]], and precious stones.

Gold deposits are a mile or two under water on the ocean floor, however the deposits are also encased in rock that must be mined through. Currently, there is no cost-effective way to mine or extract gold from the ocean to make a profit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/gold.html|title=Is there gold in the ocean?|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>

===Natural hazards===
[[File:Iceberg A22A, South Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|Iceberg A22A in the South Atlantic Ocean|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg with surrounding clouds|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg]]
[[Iceberg]]s are common from February to August in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as [[Bermuda]] and [[Madeira]]. Ships are subject to [[Superstructure (ship)|superstructure]] [[icing (nautical)|icing]] in the extreme north from October to May. Persistent fog can be a maritime hazard from May to September, as can hurricanes north of the equator (May to December).

The United States' southeast coast has a long history of shipwrecks due to its many shoals and reefs. The Virginia and North Carolina coasts were particularly dangerous.

The [[Bermuda Triangle]] is popularly believed to be the site of numerous aviation and shipping incidents because of unexplained and supposedly mysterious causes, but [[Coast Guard]] records do not support this belief.

[[Hurricanes]] are also a natural hazard in the Atlantic, but mainly in the northern part of the ocean, rarely [[tropical cyclones]] form in the southern parts. Hurricanes usually form between 1 June and 30 November of every year.

==Current environmental issues==
Endangered marine species include the [[manatee]], [[Pinniped|seals]], [[sea lion]]s, [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s. [[Drift net]] fishing can kill [[dolphin]]s, [[albatross]]es and other seabirds ([[petrel]]s, [[auk]]s), hastening the fish stock decline and contributing to international disputes.<ref>[http://www.animallaw.info/articles/arus12bcenvtlafflrev473.htm Problems and Prospects for the Pelagic Driftnet]. animallaw.info. Retrieved on 27 October 2011.</ref> Municipal pollution comes from the eastern United States, southern Brazil, and eastern Argentina; [[oil pollution]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]], [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], and [[North Sea]]; and industrial waste and municipal sewage pollution in the Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea.

In 2005, there was some concern that warm northern European currents were slowing down.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5033329 Atlantic Ocean's 'Heat Engine' Chills Down] by Christopher Joyce. All Things Considered, National Public Radio, 30 November 2005.</ref>

On 7 June 2006, Florida's wildlife commission voted to take the manatee off the state's endangered species list. Some environmentalists worry that this could erode safeguards for the popular sea creature.

===Marine pollution===
{{Main|Marine pollution}}
{{See also|Environmental impact of shipping}}
Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture [[fertilizer]] chemicals as well as [[livestock]] and [[human]] waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]] and the creation of a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].<ref>Sebastian A. Gerlach "Marine Pollution", Springer, Berlin (1975)</ref>

[[Marine debris]], which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of [[Oceanic gyres|gyres]] and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.
