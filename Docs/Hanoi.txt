Its population in 2009 was estimated at 2.6 million for urban districts<ref>[http://www.gso.gov.vn/default.aspx?tabid=387&idmid=3&ItemID=9860 General Statítcs Office ò Vietnam]</ref> and 7 million for the metropolitan jurisdiction.<ref name="balita.ph">{{cite web|url = http://www.gso.gov.vn/|title = Government of Vietnam|publisher = General Statistics office of Vietnam}}</ref> The number of population in 2015 was estimated at 7.7 million people. From 1010 until 1802, it was the most important political centre of Vietnam. It was eclipsed by [[Huế]], the imperial capital of Vietnam during the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]] (1802–1945), but Hanoi served as the capital of [[French Indochina]] from 1902 to 1954. From 1954 to 1976, it was the capital of [[North Vietnam]], and it became the capital of a reunified Vietnam in 1976, after the North's victory in the [[Vietnam War]].

The city lies on the right bank of the [[Red River (Vietnam)|Red River]]. Hanoi is {{convert|1760|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Ho Chi Minh City]] and {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Hai Phong]] city.

==Names==
Hanoi  ({{linktext|河|內}}, "River within/inside") has had many names throughout history. During the Chinese occupation of Vietnam, it was known first as '''Long Biên''', then '''Tống Bình''' ({{linktext|宋|平}}, "[[Liu Song Dynasty|Song]] Peace") and '''Long Đỗ''' ({{linktext|龍|肚}}, "Dragonbelly"). In 866, it was turned into a citadel and named '''Đại La''' ({{linktext|大|羅}}, "Big Net"). During the [[Lê dynasty]], Hanoi was known as Đông Kinh ({{linktext|東|京|}}, "Eastern Capital"); this gave the name to [[Tonkin]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Hanoi}}

=== Pre-Thăng Long period ===
Hanoi has been inhabited since at least 3000 BC. The [[Cổ Loa Citadel]] in [[Dong Anh]] district<ref>{{Citation |publisher=Lonely Planet |title=Vietnam |last=Ray |first=Nick |author2-last=Balasingamchow |author2-first=Yu-Mei |display-authors=1 |date=2010 |isbn=9781742203898 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZqOLmYD-0l4C&pg=PA123 |contribution=Co Loa Citadel |p=123 |ref={{harvid|Ray|2010}} }}.</ref> served as the capital of the [[Âu Lạc]] kingdom founded by the [[Shu (state)|Shu]] emigrant [[Thục Phán]] after his 258&nbsp;BC conquest of the native [[Văn Lang]].

In 197 BC, [[Âu Lạc]] Kingdom was annexed by [[Nanyue]], which ushered in more than a millennium of  Chinese domination. By the middle of the 5th century, in the center of ancient Hanoi, the [[Liu Song]] Dynasty set up a new district (縣) called Songping (Tong Binh), which later became a [[commandery (China)|commandery]] (郡), including two districts Yihuai (義懷) and Suining (綏寧) in the south of the Red River (now [[Từ Liêm District|Từ Liêm]] and [[Hoài Đức District|Hoài Đức]] districts) with a metropolis (the domination centre) in the present inner Hanoi. By the year 679, the [[Tang dynasty]] changed the region's name into [[Annam (Chinese province)|Annan]] (Pacified South), with Songping as its capital.<ref name="en.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn">{{cite web|url=http://en.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn/Home/Historical-stages-of-Thang-Long-Hanoi/20099/89.vnplus |title=Historical stages of Thang Long- Hanoi - 1000 Years Thang Long (VietNamPlus) |publisher=En.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn |date= |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>

In order to defeat the people’s uprisings, in the later half of the 8th century, Zhang Boyi (張伯儀), a Tang dynasty viceroy, built Luocheng (羅城, La Thanh or La citadel, from Thu Le to Quan Ngua in present-day Ba Dinh precinct). In the earlier half of the 9th century, it was further built up and called Jincheng (金城, Kim Thanh or Kim Citadel). In 866, [[Gao Pian]], the Chinese [[Jiedushi]], consolidated and named it Daluocheng (大羅城, [[Dai La citadel]], running from Quan Ngua to Bach Thao), the then-largest citadel of ancient Hanoi.<ref name="en.hanoi.vietnamplus.vn"/>

=== Thăng Long, Đông Đô, Đông Quan, Đông Kinh ===
In 1010, [[Lý Thái Tổ]], the first ruler of the [[Lý Dynasty]], moved the capital of [[Đại Việt]] to the site of the Đại La Citadel. Claiming to have seen a dragon ascending the Red River, he renamed the site '''Thăng Long''' ({{linktext|昇|龍}}, "Soaring Dragon") - a name still used poetically to this day. Thăng Long remained the capital of Đại Việt until 1397, when it was moved to [[Thanh Hóa]], then known as Tây Đô ({{linktext|西|都}}), the "Western Capital". Thăng Long then became '''Đông Đô''' ({{linktext|東|都}}), the "Eastern Capital."

In 1408, the Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]] attacked and occupied Vietnam, changing Đông Đô's name to '''Dongguan''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|東|關}}}}, ''Eastern Gateway''), or ''Đông Quan'' in Sino-Vietnamese. In 1428, the Vietnamese overthrew the Chinese under the leadership of [[Lê Lợi]],<ref name="roughguides.com">http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/asia/vietnam/hanoi-and-around/</ref> who later founded the [[Lê Dynasty]] and renamed Đông Quan '''Đông Kinh''' ({{linktext|東|京}}, "Eastern Capital") or [[Tonkin]]. Right after the end of the [[Tây Sơn Dynasty]], it was named '''Bắc Thành''' ({{linktext|北|城}}, "Northern Citadel").

=== During Nguyễn Dynasty and the French colonial period ===
[[File:TongDoc Hanoi 14-07-1884.jpg|right|thumb|People in Ha Noi, 1884]]
[[File:Vietnam1973.JPEG|right|thumb|Ha Noi, New Year 1973]]
In 1802, when the [[Nguyễn Dynasty]] was established and moved the capital to [[Huế]], the old name Thăng Long was modified to become '''Thăng Long''' ({{linktext|昇|'''龍'''}}, "Soaring Dragon"). In 1831, the Nguyễn emperor [[Minh Mạng]] renamed it Hà Nội ({{linktext|河|内}}, "Between Rivers" or "River Interior"). Hanoi was occupied by the [[French Third Republic|French]] in 1873 and passed to them ten years later. As '''Hanoï''', it became the capital of [[French Indochina]] after 1887.<ref name="roughguides.com"/>

=== During two wars ===
The city was occupied by the Imperial Japanese in 1940 and liberated in 1945, when it briefly became the seat of the [[Viet Minh]] government after [[Ho Chi Minh]] proclaimed the independence of Vietnam. However, the French returned and reoccupied the city in 1946. After nine years of fighting between the French and Viet Minh forces, Hanoi became the capital of an independent [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam|North Vietnam]] in 1954.

During the [[Vietnam War]], Hanoi's transportation facilities were disrupted by the bombing of bridges and railways. These were all, however, promptly repaired. Following the end of the war, Hanoi became the capital of a reunified Vietnam when North and [[South Vietnam]] were reunited on July 2, 1976.

=== Modern Hanoi ===
On May 29, 2008, it was decided that [[Hà Tây Province]], [[Vĩnh Phúc Province]]'s [[Mê Linh District]] and 4 communes of [[Lương Sơn District]], [[Hòa Bình Province]] be merged into the metropolitan area of Hanoi from August 1, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |work=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency |title=Country files (GNS) |accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref> Hanoi's total area then increased to 334,470 hectares in 29 subdivisions<ref name="dantri.com.vn">{{cite web

Hanoi has experienced a rapid construction boom recently. Skyscrapers, popping up in new urban areas, have dramatically changed the cityscape and have formed a modern skyline outside the old city. In 2015, Hanoi is ranked # 39 by [[Emporis]] in the list of world cities with most skyscrapers over 100 m; its two tallest buildings are [[Hanoi Landmark 72 Tower]] (336m, tallest in Vietnam and second tallest in south-east Asia after Malaysia's [[Petronas Twin Towers]]) and [[Hanoi Lotte Center]] (272m, also second tallest in Vietnam).

== Geography ==

=== Location, topography ===
[[File:Vvbb.jpg|thumb|New Residential blocks]]
Hanoi is located in northern region of Vietnam, situated in the Vietnam’s Red River delta, nearly {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} away from the coastal area. Hanoi contains three basic kind of terrain, which are the delta area, the midland area and mountainous zone. In general, the terrain is gradually lower from the north to the south and from the west to the east, with the average height ranging from 5 to 20 meters above the sea level. The hills and mountainous zones are located in the northern and western part of the city. The highest peak is at Ba Vi with 1281 m, located in the western part of the region.

==Administrative divisions==
Hà Nội is divided into 12 urban districts, 1 district-leveled town and 17 rural districts. When [[Ha Tay]] was merged into Hanoi in 2008, [[Hà Đông]] was transformed into an urban district while [[Sơn Tây]] degraded to a district-leveled town. They are further subdivided into 22 commune-level towns (or townlets), 399 communes, and 145 wards.

==Demographics==
[[File:ao dai APEC.jpg|thumb|Hanoian women wearing traditional costume [[Áo dài]] during [[APEC]] Summit 2006]]
Hanoi's population is constantly growing (about 3.5% per year), a reflection of the fact that the city is both a major metropolitan area of Northern Vietnam, and also the country's political centre. This population growth also puts a lot of pressure on the [[infrastructure]], some of which is antiquated and dates back to the early 20th century.

The number of Hanoians who have settled down for more than three generations is likely to be very small when compared to the overall population of the city. Even in the Old Quarter, where commerce started hundreds of years ago and consisted mostly of family businesses, many of the street-front stores nowadays are owned by merchants and retailers from other provinces. The original owner family may have either rented out the store and moved into the adjoining house or moved out of the neighbourhood altogether. The pace of change has especially escalated after the abandonment of central-planning economic policies and relaxing of the district-based household registrar system. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Hanoi's telephone numbers have been increased to 8 digits to cope with demand (October 2008). Subscribers' telephone numbers have been changed in a haphazard way; however, mobile phones and [[Subscriber identity module|SIM cards]] are readily available in Vietnam, with [[Prepaid mobile phone|pre-paid mobile phone credit]] available in all areas of Hanoi.

==Economy==
[[File:Keangnam-hanoi-landmark-tower-6.jpg|thumb|Keangnam Hanoi Landmark]]
Hanoi has the highest [[Human Development Index]] among the cities in Vietnam. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}According to a recent ranking by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], Hanoi will be the fastest growing city in the world in terms of GDP growth from 2008 to 2025.<ref>{{cite web
|url = http://www.bbgv.org/download/businessnewsfiles/december/2009_11_10_PwC_Hanoi%20&%20HCMC_top%20positions_economic%20growth_08-25_Final_EN_.pdf
|title = Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are topping the world's highest economic growth cities in 2008-2025
|publisher = PricewaterhouseCoopers
|date=2009-11-10}}</ref> In the year 2013, Hanoi contributed 12.6% to GDP, exported 7.5% of total exports, contributed 17% to the national budget and attracted 22% investment capital of Vietnam. The city's nominal GDP at current prices reached 451,213 billion VND (21.48 billion USD) in 2013, which made per capita GDP stand at 63.3 million VND (3,000 USD).<ref>http://thongkehanoi.gov.vn/uploads/files/source/NGTK%202013%20-TKQG%20%20Ngan%20sach%20ngan%20hang.pdf</ref>
Industrial production in the city has experienced a rapid boom since the 1990s, with average annual growth of 19.1 percent from 1991–95, 15.9 percent from 1996–2000, and 20.9 percent during 2001–2003. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In addition to eight existing industrial parks, Hanoi is building five new large-scale industrial parks and 16 small- and medium-sized industrial clusters. The non-state economic sector is expanding fast, with more than 48,000 businesses currently operating under the Enterprise Law (as of 3/2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vnexpress.net/Vietnam/Kinh-doanh/2007/04/3B9F5334/|title='Tram hoa' doanh nghiep dua no|publisher=VnExpress}}<!--Bot-generated title--></ref>
[[File:West Hanoi.jpg|thumb|West Hanoi]]
Trade is another strong sector of the city. In 2003, Hanoi had 2,000 businesses engaged in foreign trade, having established ties with 161 countries and territories. The city's export value grew by an average 11.6 percent each year from 1996–2000 and 9.1 percent during 2001–2003. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The economic structure also underwent important shifts, with tourism, finance, and banking now playing an increasingly important role. Hanoi's business districts are traditionally [[Hoàn Kiếm District|Hoàn Kiếm]], [[Đống Đa District]] and the neighborhood; and a newly developing [[Cầu Giấy District|Cầu Giấy]] and [[Từ Liêm District|Từ Liêm]] in the western part.

Similar to [[Ho Chi Minh City]], Hanoi enjoys a rapidly developing [[real estate]] market.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nld.com.vn/tintuc/kinh-te/215457.asp|title= NLĐO - Bat dong san Ha Noi soi dong ~ Bất động sản Hà Nội sôi động - KINH TẾ - TIÊU DÙNG}}</ref> The current most notable new urban areas are central Trung Hoa Nhan Chinh, [[Mỹ Đình]], the luxurious zones of [[The Manor (Hanoi)|The Manor]], [[Ciputra Tây hồ District(Hanoi)|Ciputra]] and [[Times City (Hai Bà Trưng District)|Times City]].

Agriculture, previously a pillar in Hanoi's economy, has striven to reform itself, introducing new high-yield plant varieties and livestock, and applying modern farming techniques. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Together with economic growth, Hanoi's appearance has also changed significantly, especially in recent years. Infrastructure is constantly being upgraded, with new roads and an improved public transportation system. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Landmarks==
[[File:Hanoi citadel 2.jpg|thumb|North gate of [[Hanoi Citadel]] from inside (19th century)]]
As the capital of Vietnam for almost a thousand years, Hanoi is considered one of the main cultural centres of Vietnam, where most Vietnamese dynasties have left their imprint. Even though some relics have not survived through wars and time, the city still has many interesting cultural and historic monuments for visitors and residents alike. Even when the nation's capital moved to Huế under the Nguyễn Dynasty in 1802, the city of Hanoi continued to flourish, especially after the French took control in 1888 and modeled the city's architecture to their tastes, lending an important aesthetic to the city's rich stylistic heritage. The city hosts more cultural sites than any other city in Vietnam,<ref>{{cite web

=== Old Quarter ===
The Old Quarter, near Hoàn Kiếm Lake, has the original street layout and architecture of old Hanoi. At the beginning of the 20th century the city consisted of only about 36 streets, most of which are now part of the old quarter. Each street then had merchants and households specializing in a particular trade, such as silk or jewelry.  The street names nowadays still reflect these specializations, although few of them remain exclusively in their original commerce.<ref>'A Scholar's Memoirs of the 36 Streets', in: Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David: ''Vietnam Past and Present: The North'' (History and culture of Hanoi and Tonkin). Chiang Mai. Cognoscenti Books, 2012. ASIN: B006DCCM9Q.</ref> The area is famous for its small artisans and merchants, including many silk shops. Local cuisine specialties as well as several clubs and bars can be found here also. A night market (near [[Đồng Xuân Market]]) in the heart of the district opens for business every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evening with a variety of clothing, souvenirs and food.

Some other prominent places are: The [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]] (''Văn Miếu''), site of the oldest university in Vietnam 1010; [[One Pillar Pagoda]] (''Chùa Một Cột''); [[Flag Tower of Hanoi]] (''Cột cờ Hà Nội''). In 2004, a massive part of the 900-year-old [[Hanoi Citadel]] was discovered in central Hanoi, near the site of [[Ba Đình Square]].<ref>{{cite news

=== Lakes ===
A city between rivers built from low land, Hanoi has many scenic lakes and is sometimes called "city of lakes." Among its lakes, the most famous are [[Hoàn Kiếm Lake]], [[West Lake (Hanoi)|West Lake]],  and Bay Mau Lake (inside Thongnhat Park). Hoan Kiem Lake, also known as Sword Lake, is the historical and cultural center of Hanoi, and is linked to the legend of the [[Thuận Thiên (sword)|magic sword]]. West Lake (Hồ Tây) is a popular place for people to spend time. It is the largest lake in Hanoi and there are many temples in the area.  The lakeside road in the Nghi Tam - Quang Ba area is perfect for bicycling, jogging and viewing the cityscape or enjoying lotus ponds in the summer. The best way to see the majestic beauty of a Westlake sunset is to view it from one of the many bars around the lake, especially the Sofitel Plaza rooftop bar.

=== Colonial Hanoi ===
[[File:Hanoi residence.JPG|thumb|Hotel Metropole in colonial Hanoi]]
Under French rule, as an administrative centre for the French colony of Indochina, the French colonial architecture style became dominant,  and many examples remain today: the tree-lined boulevards (e.g. Phan Dinh Phung street) and its many villas and mansions, [[Hanoi Opera House|Grand Opera House]], [[State Bank of Vietnam]] (formerly The Bank of Indochina), [[Presidential Palace, Hanoi|Presidential Palace]] (formerly the Palace of the Governor-General of French Indochina), [[St. Joseph's Cathedral, Hanoi|St. Joseph's Cathedral]], and the historic [[Sofitel Metropole|Hotel Metropole]]. Many of the colonial structures are an eclectic mixture of French and traditional Vietnamese architectural styles, such as the National Museum of Vietnamese History, the Vietnam National Museum of Fine Arts and the old Indochina Medical College. Gouveneur-Général [[Paul Doumer]] (1898-1902) played a crucial role in colonial Hanoi's urban planning. Under his tenure there was a major construction boom.<ref>Michael G. Vann, “Building Whiteness on the Red River: Race, Power, and Urbanism in Paul Doumer’s Hanoi, 1897-1902," ''Historical Reflections/Réflexions Historiques'', 2007</ref>

Critical historians of empire have noted that French colonial rule imposed a system of white supremacy on the city. Vietnamese subjects supplied labor and tax revenue, but the privileges and comforts of the city went to the white population. French efforts at rat eradication revealed some of the colonial city's racial double-standards.<ref>Michael G. Vann, "Of Rats, Rice, and Race: The Great Hanoi Rat Massacre, an Episode in French Colonial History," French Colonial History, May, 2003</ref>
[[File:Njdjkajs.jpg|thumb|Trung Hoa Nhan Chinh Area]]

===Museums===
[[File:Ssfddf.jpg|thumb|New City Trung Hoa]]
Hanoi is home to a number of museums:
* [[National Museum of Vietnamese History]]
* [[Vietnam National Museum of Fine Arts]]
* [[Vietnam Museum of Ethnology]]
* [[Vietnam Museum of Revolution]]
* [[Hỏa Lò Prison]] (Hanoi Hilton)
* [[Ho Chi Minh Museum]]
* [[Hanoi Contemporary Arts Centre]]
* [[Vietnam Military History Museum]]
* [[Hanoi Museum]]

==Tourism==
Hanoi is a very picturesque city, the metropolis sometimes dubbed the [[Paris of the East]]. With its tree-fringed boulevards, more than two dozen lakes and thousands of French colonial-era buildings, Hanoi is a popular tourist attraction.

In 2015, Hanoi ranks #4 in TripAdvisor's list of the World's Best Destinations (Travellers' Choice).

And Hanoi is the most affordable international destination in TripAdvisor's annual TripIndex report. Created to help travelers plan and budget their summer holiday, the TripIndex looks at the average cost of a three-night trip in 60 key tourist cities around the world.

==Entertainment==
[[File:Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre 2.jpg|thumb|Performance of the water puppet theatre ''Thăng Long'']]
A variety of options for entertainment in Hanoi can be found throughout the city. Modern and traditional theaters, cinemas, karaoke bars, dance clubs, bowling alleys, and an abundance of opportunities for shopping provide leisure activity for both locals and tourists. Hanoi has been named one of the top 10 cities for shopping in Asia by Water Puppet Tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterpuppettours.com/ |title=Detailed results and winners of the online Smart Travel Asia Best in Travel Poll 2009|publisher=Smarttravelasia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref> The number of art galleries exhibiting Vietnamese art has dramatically increased in recent years, now including galleries such as "Nhat Huy" of [[Huynh Thong Nhat]].

A popular traditional form of entertainment is [[Water puppetry]], which is shown, for example, at the ''Thăng Long Water Puppet Theatre.''

===Shopping===
[[File:Trang Tien Plaza.jpg|thumb|Trang Tien Plaza
]]
With rapid economic growth and extremely high population density, many modern shopping centers and megamalls have been opened in Hanoi.

Major malls are:
* [[Trang Tien Plaza]], High-end Mall on Trang Tien street (right next to Hoàn Kiếm Lake), [[Hoàn Kiếm District]]
* [[Vincom Center]], a modern mall with hi-end CGV cineplex, Ba Trieu Street (just 2&nbsp;km from Hoan Kiem lake), [[Hai Bà Trưng District]]

==Cuisine==
Hanoi has rich culinary traditions. Many of Vietnam's most famous dishes, such as [[phở]], [[chả cá]], [[bánh cuốn]] and [[cốm]] are believed to have originated in Hanoi. Perhaps most widely known is Phở—a simple rice noodle soup often eaten as breakfast at home or at street-side cafes, but also served in restaurants as a meal. Two varieties dominate the Hanoi scene: Phở Bò, containing beef, and Phở Gà, containing chicken.

Vietnam's national dish [[phở]] has been named as one of the Top 5 streetfoods in the world by globalpost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/food/100114/best-street-food-vendors |title=Best Street Food &#124; Vietnamese Pho &#124; Peruvian Food |publisher=Globalpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref>

Hanoi has a number of restaurants whose menus specifically offer dishes containing dog, snake<ref>{{cite web|title=Nguyen Van Duc Snake Restaurant|url=http://tnhvietnam.xemzi.com/vi/spot/3110/nguyen-van-duc-snake-restaurant-hanoi|work=TNH Hanoi|publisher=TNH|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Culinary Adventures in Hanoi|url=http://www.willchase.com/hanoi_snake.html|work=Will Chase Arts|publisher=Will Chase|accessdate=4 November 2012|author=Will Chase|year=2005}}</ref> and various species of insects.

==Education==
[[File:DHYDuoc.jpg|thumb|Indochina Medical College in the early 20th century, today the [[Hanoi Medical University]]]]
Hanoi, as the capital of French Indochina, was home to the first Western-style universities in Indochina, including: ''Indochina Medical College'' (1902) - now [[Hanoi Medical University]], ''Indochina University'' (1904) - now [[Vietnam National University, Hanoi|Hanoi National University]] (the largest), and ''École Supérieure des Beaux-Arts de l'Indochine'' (1925) - now [[Hanoi College of Fine Arts|Hanoi University of Fine Art]].

After the Communist Party took control over Hanoi in 1954 with support from the Soviet Union, many new universities were built, among them, [[Hanoi University of Technology]], still the largest technical university in Vietnam. Recently ULIS ([[University of Languages and International Studies]]) was rated as one of the top universities in south-east Asia for languages and language studies at the undergraduate level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/universities/vietnam-national-university-hanoi/undergrad |title=Vietnam National University, Hanoi |publisher=Top Universities |date=2012-12-08 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}</ref>  Other universities that are not part of Vietnam National University or Hanoi University include Hanoi School for Public Health and Hanoi School of Agriculture.

Hanoi is the largest center of education in Vietnam. It is estimated that 62% of the scientists in the whole country are living and working in Hanoi.<ref>{{cite web

|work=Hanoi City People's Committee
|title=Hanoi - The capital of Vietnam: Preface
}}</ref> Admissions to undergraduate study are through entrance examinations, which are conducted annually and open for everyone (who has successfully completed his/her secondary education) in the country. The majority of universities in Hanoi are public, although in recent years a number of private universities have begun operation. [[Thăng Long University]], founded in 1988, by some Vietnamese mathematics professors in Hanoi and France<ref>{{cite web|author=Viet Nam News |url=http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/showarticle.php?num=01INN290106 |title=Viet Nam News |publisher=Vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn |date=1998-04-09 |accessdate=2010-06-18}}</ref> is the first private university in Vietnam. Because many of Vietnam's major universities are located in Hanoi, students from other provinces (especially in the northern part of the country) wishing to enter university often travel to Hanoi for the annual entrance examination. Such events usually take place in June and July, during which a large number of students and their families converge on the city for several weeks around this intense examination period. In recent years, these entrance exams have been centrally coordinated by the Ministry of Education, but passing marks are decided independently by each university.

Although there are state owned [[kindergarten]]s, there are also many private ventures that serve both local and international needs. Pre-tertiary (elementary and secondary) schools in Hanoi are generally state run, but there are also some independent schools. Education is equivalent to the K–12 system in the U.S., with [[Primary education|elementary school]] between grades 1 and 5, [[middle school]] (or junior high) between grades 6 and 9, and [[high school]] from grades 10 to 12.

==Transport{{anchor|Transportation}}==
[[File:Fggg.jpg|thumb|Inside International Terminal]]
Hanoi is served by [[Noi Bai International Airport]], located in the Soc Son District, approximately {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Hanoi. The new international terminal (T2), designed and built by Japanese contractors, opened in January 2015 and is a big facelift for Noibai International Airport. In addition, a new highway and the new Nhat Tan cable-stay bridge connecting the airport and the city center opened at the same time, offering much more convenience than the old road (via Thanglong bridge). Taxis are plentiful and usually have trip meters, although it is also common to agree on the trip price before taking a taxi from the airport to the city centre.
 
Hanoi is also the origin or departure point for many [[Vietnam Railways]] train routes in the country. The [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|Reunification Express]] (tàu Thống Nhất) runs from Hanoi to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] from Hanoi station (formerly Hang Co station), with stops at cities and provinces along the line. Trains also depart Hanoi frequently for Hai Phong and other northern cities. The Reunification Express line was established during French colonial rule and was completed over a period of nearly forty years, from 1899 to 1936.<ref>{{cite web|title=Socialist Republic of Viet Nam: Greater Mekong Subregion Kunming–Hai Phong Transport Corridor:  Yen Vien–Lao Cai Railway Upgrading Project|url=http://www2.adb.org/Documents/RRPs/VIE/39175-VIE-RRP.pdf|work=Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Project Number: 39175: Asian Development Bank|publisher=Asian Development Bank|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=November 2006}}</ref> The Reunification Express between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City covers a distance of {{convert|1726|km|0|abbr=on}} and takes approximately 33 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=A fast, vast steel spine|url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/a-fast-vast-steel-spine-20120518-1yuq9.html|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 November 2012|author=Mark Smith|date=19 May 2012}}</ref> As of 2005, there were 278 stations on the Vietnamese railway network, of which 191 were located along the North-South line.
[[File:Ban do.jpg|thumb|Hanoi Metro Map]]
The main means of transport within Hanoi city are motorbikes, buses, taxis, and a rising number of cars.  In recent decades, motorbikes have overtaken bicycles as the main form of transportation. The increased number of motorcycles can cause gridlock. To minimize this and the negative consequences for the environment and health, the local government is trying to increase public transportation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Imminent gridlock |author1=Hans-Heinrich Bass |author2=Thanh Trung Nguyen |publisher=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/vietnam-needs-tackle-urban-traffic-congestion}}</ref> Public buses run on many routes and fares can be purchased on the bus, with very cheap prices (30 cents for a journey where a taxi might cost $10).

There are 2 metro lines under construction in Hanoi now.<ref>http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/dde43a4a-c0de-11e5-a8c6-deeeb63d6d4b.html</ref> The first one is expected to be operational in 2016, the second in 2018.

Persons on their own or traveling in a pair who wish to make a fast trip around Hanoi to avoid traffic jams or to travel at an irregular time or by way of an irregular route often use "xe ôm" (literally, "hug bike"). Motorbikes can also be rented from agents within the Old Quarter of Hanoi.<ref>{{cite web|title=Getting Around Hanoi|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/hanoi/0197020156.html|work=Frommer's|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref>

==Sports==
[[File:my dinh stadium.jpg|thumb|Mỹ Đình National Stadium]]There are several gymnasiums and stadiums throughout the city of Hanoi. The biggest ones are [[Mỹ Đình National Stadium]] (Lê Đức Thọ Boulevard), [[Quan Ngua Sporting Palace]] (Văn Cao Avenue), [[Hanoi Aquatics Sports Complex]] and [[Mỹ Đình Indoor Athletics Gymnasium]]. The others include [[Hàng Đẫy Stadium|Hà Nội Stadium]] (as known as Hàng Đẫy stadium). [[2009 Asian Indoor Games|The third Asian Indoor Games]] were held in Hanoi in 2009. The others are [[Hai Bà Trưng Gymnasium]], [[Trịnh Hoài Đức Gymnasium]], [[Vạn Bảo Sports Complex]].

==Health care and other facilities==
[[File:Benh vien.jpg|thumb|Vinmec Hospital]]
Some medical facilities in Hanoi:
*[[Bạch Mai Hospital]]
*[[Viet Duc Hospital]]
*[[Saint Paul Hospital]]
*[[Hospital 108]]
*[[Hôpital Français de Hanoi]]
*[[International SOS]]
*[[Hanoi Medical University Hospital]]
