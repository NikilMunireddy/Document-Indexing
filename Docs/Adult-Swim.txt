'''Adult Swim''' (stylized as '''[adult swim]''' or '''[as]''') is an American [[cable network]] that operates every night from 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00&nbsp;a.m., [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] and [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]], on [[Cartoon Network]]. Both networks are owned by [[Time Warner]] through the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] subsidiary. It is programmed by [[Williams Street|Williams Street Productions]], a subsidiary of Turner, which also developed two prior television programming blocks seen on Cartoon Network: [[Toonami]] (which later became a block on Adult Swim in 2012) and [[Miguzi]]. The name comes from a phrase used by public swimming pools to label designated times when children are restricted from using the facilities in favor of adults.

Debuting as a programming block on Cartoon Network in 2001, Adult Swim was established as alternative programming during the late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience, children and teenagers between the ages of 7–15, would normally be sleeping. Much of Adult Swim's general content is known for its risqué, unorthodox and often bizarre presentation, while many of the series features are developed in stark contrast with traditional American television programs. The network was granted its own [[Nielsen ratings]] report due to differing target demographics, and broadcasts in countries such as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].<ref name=as_split/> The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series mainly consisting of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated programming, [[short film]]s, [[Original video animation|OVAs]], and Japanese [[anime]], generally with minimal or no editing for content.

In the United States, Adult Swim has frequently aired recent or older [[adult animation]] features, Japanese [[anime]], [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]], [[sketch comedy]], [[Television pilot|pilots]], [[live-action]], and their subsequent short-lived series and spin-offs. Shows may have sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. While the network features comedies and dramas of all types, many of its programs are aesthetically [[experimental]], transgressive, improvised, and [[Surrealism|surreal]] in nature. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in [[absurdity|absurd]] and [[shock value|shock]] comedy.<ref>[http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking Adult Swim Expands Primetime as Cartoon Network Develops Originals for Web]</ref>

In February 2015, Adult Swim was available to approximately 96,390,000 pay television households (82.8% of households with television) in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/22/list-of-how-many-homes-each-cable-network-is-in-as-of-february-2015/366230/|title=List of how many homes each cable network is in as of February 2015|last=Seidman|first=Robert|work=TV by the Numbers|publisher=Zap2it|date=February 22, 2015|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref>

== History ==

===Creation and development===
{{see also|Space Ghost Coast to Coast}}
[[Cartoon Network]]'s original head programmer [[Mike Lazzo]] conceived<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs - Fred Seibert's Blog - Dinner at [adult swim].|publisher=|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref> (and continues to operate) Adult Swim. The network grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 p.m. (ET). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows like ''[[ToonHeads]]'' and ''[[Late Night Black and White]]'', both of which presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts. ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', one of Cartoon Network's first forays into original programming, was created in 1994 specifically for late night audiences. The series was created by [[Mike Lazzo]]'s Ghost Planet Industries, which eventually became [[Williams Street|Williams Street Studios]], the eventual producers and programmers of Adult Swim.

During early mornings in December 2000 (while ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' was on hiatus), several new Williams Street series made unannounced "stealth" premieres. ''[[Sealab 2021]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'', ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'' and ''[[The Brak Show]]'' all premiered unannounced;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lustforlunch.com/dgp/oldnews.htm#stealth |title=The Daily Ghost Planet : The Past! |publisher=Lustforlunch.com |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lustforlunch.com/dgp/oldnews.htm#morestealth |title=The Daily Ghost Planet : The Past! |publisher=Lustforlunch.com |date= |accessdate=January 22, 2011}}</ref> the official schedules listed the shows as "Special Programming".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Cricket|title=[adult swim]: A (not so) Brief History|url=http://geeknation.com/adult-swim-a-brief-history/|work=[[Geek Nation]]|accessdate=21 April 2014}}</ref>

===Early years and revived series: 2001–07===

From left to right: [[Keith Crofford]], [[Seth Green]], [[Matthew Senreich]], [[Scott Adsit]], [[Dino Stamatopoulos]], [[Tommy Blacha]], [[Brendon Small]], [[Jackson Publick]] and [[Doc Hammer]].]]
Adult Swim officially launched on September 2, 2001 with the debut airing of the ''[[Home Movies (TV series)|Home Movies]]'' episode "Director's Cut",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/1190|title=1st Show Aired, a bump broadcast on Adult Swim on November 23, 2008||website=bumpworthy.com|access-date=August 10, 2011}}</ref> which was shelved before airing on its original network, [[UPN]]. The first [[anime]] broadcast on Adult Swim also aired on the night of its launch, ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2001-08-02/cowboy-bebop-confirmed-for-adult-swim |title=Cowboy Bebop Confirmed for Adult Swim |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=August 2, 2001 |website= |publisher= Anime News Network |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2001-06-27|title=Interview: CN re: Cowboy Bebop and Adult Swim|publisher=Anime News Network|date=June 27, 2001}}</ref> The block initially aired on Sunday nights, with a repeat of the same block on Thursday nights.

On March 28, 2005, [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]-based [[Turner Broadcasting System]] split Adult Swim from Cartoon Network to allow [[Nielsen Media Research]] to treat it as a separate channel for ratings purposes.<ref name=as_split /> Adult Swim operates similarly to [[Nick at Nite]], as that channel also shares channel space with another cable channel (in their case, [[Nickelodeon]]) and is treated as a separate service by Nielsen due to differences in [[target demographic]]s. Promotions for Adult Swim are targeted towards the college age and those in their twenties and thirties, constituting the majority of their viewers. According to a September 1, 2004 article in ''Promo'' magazine, representatives travel to 30 universities across the U.S. to promote the Adult Swim lineup, including handing out posters for students' dorm rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chiefmarketer.com/sampling/marketing_college_try|title=College Try|last=Parry|first=Tim|date=November 1, 2004|work=Promo|publisher=Penton Media Inc.|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}</ref>

It would become increasingly common for Adult Swim to [[Burning off|burn off]] episodes of shows that never finished airing on its original network, ''[[Mission Hill]]'', ''[[Baby Blues (U.S. TV series)|Baby Blues]]'', ''[[The Oblongs]]'', and the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[When You Wish Upon a Weinstein]]". Adult Swim also had a direct and important role in the revival of two popular animated series: the aforementioned ''Family Guy'' and ''[[Futurama]]''. ''Family Guy'' premiered in reruns on Adult Swim on April 20, 2003, and immediately became the block's top-rated program, dominating late night viewing in its time period vs. cable and broadcast competition and boosting viewership by 239 percent.<ref name="history">{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1049746,00.html|title=A Brief History of the ''Family Guy''|author=Tim Stack|date=April 18, 2005|publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name="herald">{{cite news|url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/033004/ent_20040330013.shtml|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080830015955/http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/033004/ent_20040330013.shtml|archivedate=August 30, 2008|title=Family Guy returns with 22 new episodes to premiere in early 2005|date=March 29, 2004|publisher=''[[Athens Banner-Herald]]''|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref> On March 29, 2004, less than one year later, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] announced it would be renewing ''Family Guy'' for a fourth season and reviving it from cancellation.<ref name="history"/> Shortly after the announcement, [[Jim Samples]], then-general manager and executive vice president of Cartoon Network, commented, "Bringing ''Family Guy'' to the Adult Swim lineup last April really helped turn the block into a [[cultural phenomenon]] with young adults."<ref name="herald"/>

''Futurama'' was also revived in 2007 by [[Comedy Central]] for similar reasons: impressive viewership in syndication as well as high DVD sales.<ref name="futurama">{{cite news|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/06/19/what-revived-futurama-some-lessons-for-fans/54694|title=What Revived ‘Futurama’?: Some Lessons For Fans|author=Bill Gorman|date=June 19, 2010|publisher=TV By the Numbers|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref> Adult Swim obtained ''Futurama'''s exclusive cable syndication rights in March 2002 for a reported $10 million,<ref name="DailyVariety">{{cite news| url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92028223.html| title = Toon Net Gets 'Futurama'| work = [[Daily Variety]]| date = September 9, 2001| accessdate = May 28, 2008}}</ref> and the series first aired on the network in January 2002.<ref name="businesswire">{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Twentieth+Television+Continues+Successful+Off-Network+Run+of+FUTURAMA...-a092809237|title=Twentieth Television Continues Successful Off-Network Run of FUTURAMA on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim|date=September 27, 2002|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}</ref> In 2006, [[Twentieth Television]] struck a deal to produce four [[direct-to-video]] animated features based on ''Futurama'', and, in 2009, the series was revived in normal half-hour installments beginning in 2010 on [[Comedy Central]].<ref name="futurama"/> In a 2006 interview, ''Futurama'' creator [[Matt Groening]] explained "There's a long, regal history of misunderstood TV shows, and to Fox's credit, the studio looked at the ratings on the Cartoon Network and how the show does overseas, and saw that there was more money to be made."<ref name="avclub">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/|title=Interview - Matt Groening|author=Nathan Rabin|date=April 26, 2006|publisher=''[[The A.V.

=== 2007 Boston bomb scare ===
{{main|2007 Boston Mooninite panic}}

On Wednesday, January 31, 2007, both the Boston Police Department and the Boston Fire Department mistakenly identified battery-powered LED placards resembling two characters from the Adult Swim animated television series ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' as improvised explosive devices. These devices were in fact part of a guerrilla marketing advertising campaign.

The next day, Boston authorities arrested two men involved with the incident. Peter Berdovsky, 27, a freelance video artist from [[Arlington, Massachusetts]], and Sean Stevens, 28, were facing charges of placing a hoax device to incite panic, as well as one count of disorderly conduct, according to [[CNN]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/01/31/boston.bombscare/index.html| title=Two held after ad campaign triggers Boston bomb scare|publisher=CNN.com}}</ref> (which is also owned by Turner Broadcasting System).

On February 5, Turner Broadcasting and marketer Interference, Inc. announced that they would pay $2 million in [[wikt:amends|amends]]: one million to the city of Boston, and one million in goodwill funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/02/05/boston.turner/index.html|title=Turner, contractor to pay $2M in Boston bomb scare|publisher=CNN|access-date=April 29, 2007}}</ref> Four days later, on February 9, Jim Samples, general manager and Executive Vice President of Cartoon Network since 2001, resigned.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Andrew|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/02/cartoon_network.html|title=Cartoon Network head resigns after Boston bomb scares|publisher=The Boston Globe|website=boston.com|date=February 9, 2007|access-date=April 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211180153/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/02/cartoon_network.html|archive-date=February 11, 2007}}</ref>

Turner Broadcasting later issued an apology for the ad campaign that caused the bomb scares. A statement emailed to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' from Turner Broadcasting said:

<blockquote>"The 'packages' in question are magnetic lights that pose no danger. They are part of an outdoor marketing campaign in 10 cities in support of Adult Swim's animated television show ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force''. They had been in place for two to three weeks in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Houston, Texas|Houston]], [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], and [[Philadelphia]]. Parent company Turner Broadcasting is in contact with local and federal law enforcement on the exact locations of the billboards. We regret that they were mistakenly thought to pose any danger."</blockquote>

===Later years and expansion: 2007–present===
In 2007, Adult Swim announced it would expand to seven nights a week starting that July. Up until then, it was only on Saturdays-Thursdays, with Cartoon Network airing 24 hours on Friday. On July 6 of that year, Adult Swim had its first broadcast on a Friday with an all-night marathon of ''Family Guy'' with one episode, ''[[Peter's Two Dads]]'', rerunning the April Fools gag of that year, running the first half-hour of ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters'' in a small square on the bottom left hand corner.

[[Angus Oblong]], creator of ''The Oblongs'', said new episodes of the series will return to Adult Swim.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ohanesian|first1=Liz|title=LA People 2009: Angus Oblong - This Clown's Life|url=http://www.laweekly.com/la-life/la-people-2009-angus-oblong-this-clowns-life-2159337|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=1 March 2016|date=April 22, 2009}}</ref> Adult Swim stated on July 4, 2010 that they asked studios to produce new episodes and "some said yes, some said no".<ref name=statement>{{cite web|title=Oblongs Revival Question|url=http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/3228|publisher=bump worthy|date=July 4, 2010|accessdate=October 2010}}</ref>

On December 27, 2010, Adult Swim's [[sign-on]] time was moved one hour earlier, from its longtime start time of 10:00&nbsp;p.m. ET to 9:00&nbsp;p.m. ET, extending the network's daily schedule to nine hours.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/television/adult-swim-preps-deeper-dive-prime-114737|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100217063000/http://www.mediaweek.com/mw/content_display/news/cable-tv/e3i82693d9fec5d7f3494e7df82fbe4c0b1 |archivedate=February 17, 2010 |title=Adult Swim Preps for Deeper Dive Into Prime |deadurl=no |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, on March 31, 2014, Adult Swim's [[sign-on]] time was moved to 8:00&nbsp;p.m. ET, further extending the network's daily schedule to ten hours and effectively matching the airtime of most nights that [[Nick at Nite]] has.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/business/media/adult-swim-no-1-with-younger-adults-is-expanding.html |title=Adult Swim, No. 1 With Younger Adults, Is Expanding |first=Bill |last=Carter |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 4, 2014 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref>

=== Stylistic history ===
[[File:Old Adult Swim Logo.png|thumb|left|200px|Original Adult Swim channel logo, used from September 2, 2001 until May 25, 2003.]]
Adult Swim's original [[Bumper (broadcasting)|bumpers]] shown in-between shows featured footage of [[old age|elderly people]] swimming in public pools, eating, exercising, and doing other pool-related activities. Some of these bumpers were narrated by a [[lifeguard]] who spoke through a [[megaphone]]. The logo was the words "Adult Swim" in all capital letters, shown after a freeze frame of the footage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/974|title=2001 Pool #20|website=Bumpworthy.com}}</ref> When the Saturday night block debuted on February 23, 2002, it featured clips from the various anime programs displayed on the block. The original theme music for Adult Swim, titled "D-Code," was a remix of "Mambo Gallego" done by the [[Melbourne]] musician Dust Devil, originally played by Latin jazz musician [[Tito Puente|Tito Puente, Sr.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://adtunes.com/archives/2006/04/19/adult_swims_mambo.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060504094747/http://adtunes.com/archives/2006/04/19/adult_swims_mambo.html|archivedate=May 4, 2006|title=Adult Swim's Mambo|work=Adtunes}}</ref>

On January 12, 2003, the senior citizens were replaced by animated safety manuals featuring Adult Swim characters. The logo changed to the words "adult swim" in red and a black circle with a [[yellow]] [[umbra|penumbra]]. The current bumps debuted on May 25, 2003 and feature black [[intertitle]] "cards" in white Helvetica Neue Condensed Bold type.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boards.adultswim.com/t5/Bumps/Bump-Font/m-p/50169811 |title=Bump Font - Adult Swim Message Boards |publisher=Boards.adultswim.com |date=June 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref> The cards discuss everything from programming news to personal staff opinions on unrelated subjects. In addition, the bumpers for the action shows include [[Tilt-shift miniature faking|tilt-shift miniature]] and other abstract photos of Japan, often accompanied by clips of various [[Madlib#Yesterdays New Quintet|Yesterdays New Quintet]] songs. The most recent bumper cards have the "[adult swim]" caption somewhere within photographs of places – often with roads or road signs throughout the world.

The bumps occasionally pay tribute to a recent death, in which there is no music or sound effects, but only a fade in, showing the person's name, along with the year of their birth and the year of their death, followed by a fade out. This has been done for many celebrities, including [[Vincent Schiavelli]], [[Macho Man Randy Savage]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Alex Toth]], [[Harry Goz]], [[Frank Buckles]] and [[Andy Griffith]], [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[John Ritter]], [[Farrah Fawcett]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Gary Coleman]], [[Richard Dunn (actor)|Richard Dunn]], [[Steve Jobs]], and [[Yogi Berra]].

At certain times during the evening, the bumps will give a programming lineup for an upcoming date. When this format is given, certain shows will be given a specified color (indicating a premiere), with a caption at the bottom that reads "All Times and Music Eastern". The music in the background has a decidedly Indian flair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/2135|title=Saturday Schedule Building - Saturday Schedule|website=bumpworthy.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/2136|title=Sunday Schedule Sunrise - Sunday Schedule|website=Bumpworthy.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/2329|website=Bumpworthy.com|title=Sunday Schedule Tower - Sunday Schedule}}</ref>

In 2009, ''[[King of the Hill]]'' featured unique bumpers which only air when the program is being shown. They include the fictional restaurants, shops, organizations, and local services seen within the show itself and act as sponsors during the bump followed by an actual sponsor (such as "''King of the Hill'' is brought to you by [[Strickland Propane]], and by the [[United States Air Force]]" and "Tonight's ''King of the Hill'' episode is brought to you by The Arlen Barn. The best meatloaf in the county, and now serving sandwiches").<ref>[http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/1270 Bumpworthy.com] KOTH Sponsor 9</ref><ref>[http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/1269 Bumpworthy.com] KOTH Sponsor 8</ref><ref>[http://www.bumpworthy.com/bumps/1268 Bumpworthy.com] KOTH Sponsor 7</ref> On December 25, 2009, the network began to air "Promos of the Decade", a special bump that showed some of the best promos since Adult Swim's debut in 2001. The air times in many of the promos were crossed out in yellow.

On March 31, 2014, adult swim re-branded their bumpers. From 8pm to 11pm (ET/PT) on their first day and from 8pm to 12am (ET/PT) from their second day onwards, the new bumpers include live action pans of landscapes, signs, objects, and animals with the Adult Swim logo embossed in them, sometimes hidden. Also the advisory sign-on bumper has changed from the traditional black and white bumper to a live shot as well.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-PaRiRV8aw Adult Swim March 31, 2014, New bumpers</ref> The content warning message is "''[adult swim] may contain mature material some viewers may not find suitable''". Adult Swim still airs the traditional black and white bumpers and advisory bumpers nightly from 12am to 6am (ET/PT), during the overnight hours.

Adult Swim has an annual tradition of celebrating [[April Fools' Day]] by tricking and fooling their audience by altering programs or airing different and obscure programs.

* In 2006, Adult Swim aired old re-runs of ''[[Mister T (TV series)|Mr. T]]'' and ''[[Chuck Norris: Karate Kommandos]]'', and then aired episodes of ''[[Fullmetal Alchemist]]'' and ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' with fart noises added to the dialog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tviv.org/Adult_Swim#April_Fool.27s_Day |title=Adult Swim |publisher=The Tv Iv |date= |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20101224201819/http://tviv.org/Adult_Swim| archivedate= December 24, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG3UhUFbabU</ref>

Technically, they made good on their promise by showing the first two minutes (which had long been available on the movie's website) full-screen and the entire rest of the film in a very small [[picture-in-picture]] window with its sound played over SAP.<ref name="web.archive.org"/>
* In 2008, Adult Swim aired a night of unfinished sneak peeks of future upcoming shows in place of their typical programing.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
* In 2009, Adult Swim aired ''[[The Room (film)|The Room]]'', with [[sex scene]]s obscured with black boxes.
* In 2010, Adult Swim re-aired ''The Room'' for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring [[Tommy Wiseau]] being interviewed on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''. Sex scenes remained censored, but the [[TV Parental Guidelines|parental rating]] was raised to TV-MA.
* In 2011, ''The Room'' was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled ''Earth Ghost'', a CGI version of the ''Lowe Country'' pilot shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] in 2007.
* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with [[Toonami]], a former programming block from [[Cartoon Network]]. After first playing the opening sequence of ''The Room'', the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of ''[[Bleach (manga)|Bleach]]''. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring ''[[Dragon Ball|Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo! Ryo-Ohki]]'', ''[[Outlaw Star]]'', ''[[The Big O]]'' season 1, ''[[YuYu Hakusho]]'', ''[[Blue Submarine No. 6]]'', ''[[Trigun]]'', ''[[Astro Boy (1963 TV series)|Astro Boy]]'', and ''[[Gigantor]]''. T.O.M. also presented a review of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured. Subsequently, on May 16, 2012, Adult Swim announced via [[Twitter]] and later by a press release that Toonami would return to Adult Swim on May 26, 2012 as a regular weekly Saturday night programming block.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toonami returns May 26 on Adult Swim|url=http://video.adultswim.com/toonami/|accessdate=May 25, 2012}}</ref>
* In 2013, Adult Swim featured images of cats throughout much of its programming. All of the bumps contained videos and images of cats, while the episodes of the live action shows aired that night had cat faces covering up the faces of the actors. The [adult swim] logo was replaced with "[meow meow]".<ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjcpPcgoi2s</ref>
*In 2014, Adult Swim premiered an eighth episode of ''[[Perfect Hair Forever]]'', seven years following the series finale. This was followed by an unannounced ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast'' marathon featuring creator-chosen episodes (including the full version of "Fire Ant", which has rarely been shown on TV). During the marathon, bumps were included between episodes showing outtakes and commentary from the writers and staff.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJWzXggJoyg Adult swim 2014 April fools</ref> The entire stunt was replayed all day the following day without advertisements on the network's live feed webcam.
*In 2015, Adult Swim aired a marathon of ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', featuring a version of the "Coin Hunt" game from Adult Swim's online ''Fish Center'' program.
*In 2016, advertisements were shown for the April Fools broadcast, recapping their 12-year history of pranks and hyping up that year's prank. When midnight did occur, regular programming played, with the implication being that the prank for 2016 was that there was no prank.

===Online video streaming===
Beginning in 2006, Adult Swim Video (originally named Adult Swim Fix upon launch) offered a free online [[video on demand]] service for recent and older episodes of a selection of its shows. In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1–3 days after broadcast. In late 2012, the service was rebranded as "adultswimtv.com". However, now the service has no name.

In August 2011, Adult Swim introduced Adult Swim Gold, a [[paywall]] available for cable and satellite subscribers with [[TV Everywhere]] authentication to see full episodes of Adult Swim programs. The selection of full episodes available on Adult Swim Video for public viewing without using Adult Swim Gold was greatly reduced from the prior offering.<ref>[http://video.adultswim.com/gold Adult Swim Gold Episodes] (accessed June 25, 2014)</ref> As of June 2014, the service has been combined with "Watch [adult swim]" (see also "Live Stream in the United States") with the latest episodes available only to subscribers.<ref>[http://video.adultswim.com/watch/ Watch Adult Swim] (accessed July 2, 2014)</ref>

As of December 2013, over 30 online-exclusive shows are available on the website.

In 2014, Adult Swim began posting every episode of select shows online for permanent free viewing. However, some of the shows that had all their episodes available for free (Such as Sealab 2021, Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law, and Moral Orel) have been removed as [[Hulu]] gained the rights to the shows, exclusively for Plus users.<ref>[http://video.adultswim.com/promos/dream-team-stream-team.html Dream team Stream Team]. Retrieved May 11, 2014.</ref> Around the same time, Adult Swim added a [[24/7 service|24/7]] live [[webcam]] to their official website that streams [[Marathon (television)|marathons]] of different shows all day long on a loop. Nowadays, there are multiple marathon streams; for Tim & Eric shows, ''Venture Bros.'' and ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''.

=== Video games ===
Adult Swim partnered with [[Midway Games]] in 2005 to begin development on [[video game]]s based on ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'', ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''The Brak Show'' and ''[[Sealab 2021]]''. The game based on ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'', ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Zombie Ninja Pro-Am]],'' was released on November 5, 2007 for [[PlayStation 2]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=3971|title=&#91;Midway bags Adult Swim license&#93;|last=Scalzo |first=John|date=January 15, 2005|publisher=Gaming Target, Inc.|accessdate=March 16, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050218091916/http://www.gamingtarget.com/article.php?artid=3971|archivedate=February 18, 2005}}</ref> The game is a golf game with fighting and racing levels.

In December 2012, the [[Valve Corporation]] announced costumes for the online first person shooter ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' based on Adult Swim characters.

=== Music ===
{{see also|Williams Street Records}}
Adult Swim has partnerships with several independent music labels, and has co-produced and released compilation albums with [[Stones Throw Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/9520/Stones-Throw-Records-Chrome-Children/ |title=Stones Throw Records - Chrome Children (album review ) |publisher=Sputnikmusic |date= |accessdate=2014-06-17}}</ref> [[Ghostly International]], [[Definitive Jux]], and [[Chocolate Industries]] through their own label, Williams Street Records. Many of Adult Swim's bumps and packaging make use of instrumental and electronic music. Various music is also often borrowed from artists signed onto a wide array of different labels, including [[Warp Records]] and [[Ninja Tune Records]].

=== Video on demand ===
In mid-2004, Adult Swim launched a [[video on demand]] service on cable television providers, branded as "Adult Swim Video".{{citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=Timing is important to the history of VOD}} The comedy section features several episodes from various Adult Swim original series, while the action section shows anime series and movies licensed by [[Bandai|Bandai Entertainment]], [[Geneon Entertainment]], and [[Viz Media]], some of which were never broadcast. The anime series ''[[s-CRY-ed]]'' initially premiered on demand before debuting on the regular block in May 2005.

Several Adult Swim shows are also available for purchase on [[iTunes]]. Furthermore, as of November 22, 2006, some Adult Swim shows can be bought and accessed from the Xbox Live Video Marketplace, PlayStation Video Store, and the Amazon Video on Demand Store.

In October 2013, Turner Broadcasting in partnership with MCM Media and Movideo launched a [[video on demand]] service Adult Swim Australia.<ref name="mcmmedia.com.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.mcmmedia.com.au/news/turner-broadcasting-brings-adult-swim-to-australia-in-partnership-with-mcm-media-and-movideo |title= turner-broadcasting-brings-adult-swim-to-australia-in-partnership-with-mcm-media-and-movideo |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}</ref> The site features a library of 1500 Adult Swim episodes and short video clips from various Adult Swim series.

=== Podcast and Adult Swim Mobile ===
Adult Swim offered a video [[podcast]] on [[iTunes]] from March 21 to September 19, 2006. The podcasts featured behind-the-scenes segments of shows and exclusive content; such as an interview with ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'''s [[Dennis Haskins]] and a look at [[Brendon Small]] and [[Tommy Blacha]]'s ''Metalocalypse''. The podcast reached number two in iTunes' ranking of most downloaded podcasts.

=== Live Stream in the United States ===
Beginning on September 25, 2013 Turner Broadcasting System's The Cartoon Network Inc. began the live streaming of the Adult Swim channel through the Watch Adult Swim mobile app<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adult-swim/id417871100?mt=8|title=Adult Swim|author=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.|date=February 17, 2011|work=App Store|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adultswim.videoapp.android&hl=en|title=[adult swim] - Android Apps on Google Play|author=[adult swim] games|publisher=|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref> and on the Adultswim.com Video on Demand service known as "AS LIVE".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwtv/article/Adult-Swim-to-Live-Stream-From-All-Android-and-iOS-Devices-20130925|title=Adult Swim to Live Stream From All Android and iOS Devices|author=TV News Desk|publisher=|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://brief.promaxbda.org/content/adult-swim-live-streaming|title=Adult Swim Launches Live Streaming - PromaxBDA Brief|publisher=|accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref> To access the live stream the user must be a subscriber to and log-in through their cable or satellite provider service account. Once authenticated the user can then select either the East or West Coast feeds to view the live feed which is optimized to play on both on a wireless Internet and cell data (i.e. 3G/4G) services.

Currently the Watch Adult Swim service is available to subscribers of approximately 100 different cable and satellite providers including [[AT&T U-verse]], [[Cablevision]], [[Charter Communications|Charter]], [[Comcast|Comcast Xfinity]], [[Cox Communications|Cox]], [[DirecTV]], [[Suddenlink]] and [[Verizon FiOS]], and new cable providers are added frequently as needed.

Unlike its traditional broadcast counterpart, the AS Live internet stream does not show the same commercials.  This is primarily due to a contractual agreement between most American broadcast networks, including Turner owned properties, and the union [[SAG-AFTRA]] which represents television and radio performers and [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] which acts on behalf of music composers and performers for royalty payments. Under this agreement {{citation needed|date=October 2013}} broadcast networks are required to pay a certain royalty fee to performers for commercials that they appeared in, provided voice-over or musical performance in. To usurp this Adult Swim broadcasts either a still card with a picture of an owl and the words "Please Stand-By Commercial Break" or Adult Swim program promos.

As of September 2015, the Adult Swim live stream now contains seven channels:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adultswim.com/videos/streams |title=Adult Swim Streams |publisher=Adultswim.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref>
*  ''[[FishCenter Live]]'': a live feed of the aquarium at the Adult Swim offices with a fish-themed call-in show that takes place weekdays at 4pm EST with re-runs starting at 7pm EST.
*  Marathon: 24-hour marathons of select Adult Swim shows, changing (usually) every day. Most of the time, however, the daily marathons are actually just 3 hours of programming on loop.
*  ''[[Toonami]]'' Marathon: Weekly marathons of select Toonami programming of past and present, changing every week. Toonami Pre-Flight, a talk show about and for Toonami, airs every day at 5pm EST, with new episodes once every week. The daily marathons here are also just 3 hours of programming on loop, with different episodes every day. On Sundays, the stream repeats the Toonami block from the day before.
*  ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'': A marathon of ''Off the Air'', containing short films from the internet
*  ''Tim & Eric'': a 24/7 marathon stream consisting of ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'', ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'', ''[[Check It Out with Dr. Steve Brule]]'', and ''[[Tim and Eric's Bedtime Stories]]''.
*  ''The Venture Bros.'': A 24/7 marathon stream of every episode of ''The Venture Bros''.
*  ''Lunchtime Games'': A live feed of Williams Street staff playing video games while eating lunch. Has call-ins like FishCenter and re-runs constantly.
*  ''Ghost Planet'': A special Space Ghost: Coast to Coast stream released in chapters, each chapter contains a few episodes and some extra features (some from the DVDs) edited together into a program about an hour long. Currently, there are 5 chapters.

[[File:Mapa Adult Swim.jpg|thumb|international channel availability]]
Adult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005. As with the United States, the block airs in [[Canada]], New Zealand, Australia, [[Russia]], [[Brazil]] and the rest of Latin America. Other Cartoon Network markets choose not to air it due to local market conditions, licensing programs to other broadcasters or government content restrictions or regulations – such as [[Ofcom]] in the United Kingdom. In those markets, where regulation issues arise, the block is licensed to other networks or television stations instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/broadcasting/broadcast-codes/broadcast-code/ |title=The Ofcom Broadcasting Code |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |date=July 25, 2005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.ofcom.org.uk/search?q=cache:CB4yiX-KVxYJ:www.ofcom.org.uk/accessibility/rtfs/bulletins/archive07/bb81.rtf+Adult+Swim&access=p&output=xml_no_dtd&site=AllofOfcom&ie=UTF-8&client=default_frontend&proxystylesheet=default_frontend&oe=UTF-8 |title=OFcom Bulletin |accessdate=June 26, 2008 |date=March 4, 2007 }}</ref>

To date, the Adult Swim lineup on The Comedy Channel has grown considerably with the block now airing every Saturday from 12 to 2 a.m. AEST and 6:30 to 7:30&nbsp;p.m. AEST to keep with the late night tradition of the former block. The new incarnation also premiered a lot of other Adult Swim shows including ''[[Moral Orel]]'', ''[[Titan Maximum]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken: Star Wars]]'', ''[[Frisky Dingo]]'', ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job]]'' and ''[[Childrens Hospital (TV Series)|Childrens Hospital]]'' (airing uncensored with profanity intact), along with the latest additions but aired at a different time, ''[[Metalocalypse]]'' and ''[[The Venture Bros]]'', the latter making it the third show with ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'' and ''Harvey Birdman'' to have been aired on both the old and the new block.

Some series that aired on Adult Swim have been released to [[DVD region code|Region 4]] DVD by [[Madman Entertainment]], including shows that have never been shown on Australian television before. Madman Entertainment has also released R4 exclusive DVDs not available in the USA, including Volume 2 and 3 of ''Moral Orel'' and complete collections of ''[[Minoriteam]]'' and ''[[Assy McGee]]''.

The ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters]]'' has also been quietly released to DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://burn.com.au/Aqua-Teen-Hunger-Force-Colon-Movie-Film-for-Theatres-DVD/693986.html |title=Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters DVD |publisher=Burn.com.au |date=April 2, 2008 |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref> After moving to The Comedy Channel, Adult Swim does not currently air in New Zealand.

=== Canada ===
{{Main|Adult Swim (Canada)|Teletoon at Night}}
[[Teletoon (Canadian TV channel)|Teletoon]]'s English-language service in Canada has an adult-oriented block called "[[Teletoon at Night]]" (previously known as "The Detour") that airs programming similar to Adult Swim every night. Adult Swim programs that have aired in the past include ''[[12 oz. Mouse]]'', ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'', ''Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law'', ''Metalocalypse'', ''Robot Chicken'', ''Squidbillies'', ''[[Stroker and Hoop]]'', ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'', ''The Venture Bros.'', ''[[Home Movies (TV series)|Home Movies]]'', ''[[Tom Goes to the Mayor]]'' and ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''.

''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' aired on [[Bell Media]]'s [[The Comedy Network]]. Since July 2007, 7 of the 14 Adult Swim programs airing on The Detour left the block and made way for Canadian-made adult cartoon series. ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' was the final Adult Swim series on the block. Teletoon's [[Télétoon (Canadian TV channel)|French-language service]] also has an adult-oriented block called "Télétoon la Nuit" that airs shows like ''[[The Boondocks (TV series)|The Boondocks]]'', ''Family Guy'', ''Home Movies'', ''Robot Chicken'', ''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]''.

Meanwhile, [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] aired anime series that premiered on Adult Swim in its ''[[Bionix]]'' block.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ytv.com/programming/bionix/  |title=Bionix - Anime TV shows on Saturday Night |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=August 22, 2008 |accessdate=January 20, 2011 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080822141114/http://www.ytv.com/programming/bionix/ |archivedate = August 22, 2008}}</ref> As well, [[G4 Canada|G4]]'s [[Anime Current]] block, Razer's (now [[MTV2 (Canada)|MTV2]]) Kamikaze block, the defunct Scream (later [[Dusk (TV channel)|Dusk]]) and [[Super Channel (Canada)|Super Channel]] have all aired various anime titles.

In June 2009, [[G4 Canada]] Canada launched ''[Adult Digital Distraction]]'', a programing block featuring many Adult Swim shows. In late 2011, the block was discontinued due to pressure from the CRTC on account of the channel deviating from its original format (which was to air technology-related programming). The block had briefly been relaunched featuring ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'', ''[[Eagleheart (TV series)|Eagleheart]]'', ''[[NTSF:SD:SUV::]]'', ''[[Delocated]]'', ''[[Metalocalypse]]'', ''Aqua Teen Hunger Force'', ''[[Superjail!]]'', and ''The Venture Bros.'' but was once again discontinued in 2012.

On February 2, 2012, TELETOON Canada Inc. announced that it would be launching a Canadian version of Adult Swim, sharing channel space the Canadian version of [[Cartoon Network (Canada)|Cartoon Network]] as one [[speciality channel]]. The block launched on July 4, 2012.<ref name="CN-Teletoon"/> By September 2015, all of Adult Swim's original series moved to the block.

In December 2013, [[Much (TV channel)|Much]] began airing ''[[Childrens Hospital (TV Series)|Childrens Hospital]]'' and, later, its spinoff, ''[[Newsreaders]]''. It also includes the short-lived series ''[[The Jack and Triumph Show]]''.
