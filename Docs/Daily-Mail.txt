On this date it also absorbed the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'', which had been published as a tabloid by the same company. The publisher of the ''Mail'', the [[Daily Mail and General Trust]], is currently a [[FTSE 250 Index|FTSE 250]] company and the paper has a circulation of around two million which is the fourth-largest [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of any English language daily newspaper in the world.<ref name="12inworld">{{Cite journal|year=2005|url=http://www.wan-press.org/article2825.html|title=World's 100 Largest Newspapers|publisher=World Association of Newspapers|accessdate=12 April 2008}} <!-- changed this from "twelfth highest" to "one of the highest" because the positions are now likely to have changed somewhat --></ref>

==History==

===Early history===
The ''Daily Mail'', devised by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Alfred Harmsworth]] (later [[Lord Northcliffe]]) and his brother Harold (later [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]]), was first published on 4 May 1896. It was an immediate success. It cost a halfpenny at a time when other London dailies cost one penny, and was more populist in tone and more concise in its coverage than its rivals. The planned issue was 100,000 copies but the print run on the first day was 397,215 and additional printing facilities had to be acquired to sustain a circulation which rose to 500,000 in 1899. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], 19th-century [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], dismissed the ''Daily Mail'' as "a newspaper produced by office boys for office boys."<ref name="Victorians">{{Cite book|last = Wilson|first = A. N.|authorlink = A. N. Wilson|title = The Victorians|publisher=W. W. Norton|year = 2003|location = New York|page = 590|url =|isbn = 978-0-393-04974-9}}
</ref> By 1902, at the end of the [[Boer War]]s, the circulation was over a million, making it the largest in the world.<ref name="Griffiths2006">{{Cite book|title=Fleet Street: Five Hundred Years of the Press|first=Dennis |last=Griffiths|publisher=The British Library |pages=132–3|isbn=0-7123-0697-8|year=2006}}</ref><ref name="Paul2001a">{{Cite book|title=News and News Sources|page=83|author=Paul Manning|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yddZAAAAMAAJ|isbn=978-0-7619-5796-6|year=2001| publisher=Sage Publications}}</ref>

With Harold running the business side of the operation and Alfred as Editor, the ''Mail'' from the start adopted an [[Imperialism|imperialist]] political stance, taking a patriotic line in the [[Second Boer War]], leading to claims that it was not reporting the issues of the day objectively.<ref name="Ref_a">Gardiner, The Times, The Atlantic Monthly, January 1917 page 113</ref> From the beginning, the ''Mail'' also set out to entertain its readers with human interest stories, serials, features and competitions (which were also the main means by which the Harmsworths promoted the paper).

In 1900 the ''Daily Mail'' began printing simultaneously in both Manchester and London, the first national newspaper to do so (in 1899, the ''Daily Mail'' had organised special trains to bring the London-printed papers north). The same production method was adopted in 1909 by the ''[[Daily Sketch]]'', in 1927 by the ''[[Daily Express]]'' and eventually by virtually all the other national newspapers. Printing of the ''Scottish Daily Mail'' was switched from Edinburgh to the Deansgate plant in Manchester in 1968 and, for a while, ''[[The People]]'' was also printed on the ''Mail'' presses in Deansgate. In 1987, printing at Deansgate ended and the northern editions were thereafter printed at other Associated Newspapers plants.

In 1906 the paper offered £1,000 for the first flight across the [[English Channel]] and £10,000 for the first flight from London to [[Manchester]]. ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine thought the idea preposterous and offered £10,000 for the first flight to [[Mars]], but by 1910 both the ''Mail''{{-'}}s prizes had been won. (For full list see [[Daily Mail aviation prizes|''Daily Mail'' aviation prizes]].)

[[File:Daily Mail Zeppelin Fund WWI.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement by the ''Daily Mail'' for insurance against [[Zeppelin]] attacks during the [[First World War]]]]
The paper was accused of warmongering before the outbreak of [[World War I]], when it reported that Germany was planning to crush the [[British Empire]]. Northcliffe created controversy by advocating [[conscription]] when the war broke out.<ref name="Ref_c">New York Times Current History 1917, New York Times Company, 1917 p. 211</ref> On 21 May 1915 Northcliffe wrote a blistering attack on [[Horatio Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]], the [[Secretary of State for War]]. Kitchener was considered a national hero, and overnight the paper's circulation dropped from 1,386,000 to 238,000. Fifteen hundred members of the [[London Stock Exchange]] ceremonially burned the unsold copies and launched a boycott against the Harmsworth Press. Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] accused the paper of being disloyal to the country.

When Kitchener died, the ''Mail'' reported it as a great stroke of luck for the British Empire{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}. The paper then campaigned against Asquith, who resigned on 5 December 1916.<ref name="Jocelyn2003">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dr_JtG9-4DMC|page=368|title=Britain, 1846–1919|author=Jocelyn Hunt|isbn=978-0-415-25707-7|year=2003|publisher=Routledge}}</ref> His successor [[David Lloyd George]] asked Northcliffe to be in his cabinet, hoping it would prevent him from criticising the government.

===Inter-war period===

====Before 1930====
As Lord Northcliffe aged, his grip on the paper slackened and he might have nothing to do with it for months at a time. But light-hearted stunts might enliven him, such as the Hat campaign in the winter of 1920. This was a contest with a prize of £100 for a new design of hat—a subject in which Northcliffe took a particular interest. There were 40,000 entries and the winner was a cross between a top hat and a bowler christened the ''Daily Mail Sandringham Hat''. The paper subsequently promoted the wearing of it but without much success.<ref name="Paul1972">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xlJUM8gkNe0C|page=232|title=The house of Northcliffe|first=Paul|last=Ferris|isbn=978-0-529-04553-9|year=1972|publisher=Garland Science}}</ref> In 1922, when Lord Northcliffe died, [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]] took full control of the paper.

In 1919 [[Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown|Alcock and Brown]] made the first flight across the Atlantic, winning a prize of £10,000 from the ''Daily Mail''. In 1930 the ''Mail'' made a great story of another aviation stunt, awarding another prize of £10,000 to [[Amy Johnson]] for making the first solo flight from England to Australia.<ref name="Charles1968">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3dgOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA239|page=239|title=Britain between the wars, 1918–1940|first=Charles Loch|last=Mowat|isbn=978-0-416-29510-8|year=1968|publisher=Methuen}}</ref>

The ''Daily Mail'' had begun the [[Ideal Home Exhibition]] in 1908. At first, Northcliffe had disdained this as a publicity stunt to sell advertising and he refused to attend. But his wife exerted pressure upon him and he changed his view, becoming more supportive. By 1922 the editorial side of the paper was fully engaged in promoting the benefits of modern appliances and technology to free its female readers from the drudgery of housework.<ref name="Adrian2004">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nNBoXi8sXMwC&pg=PA97 |title=Gender, modernity, and the popular press in inter-war Britain|author=Adrian Bingham|isbn=978-0-19-927247-1|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> The ''Mail'' maintained the event until selling it to Media 10 in 2009.<ref name="marketingweek">{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingweek.co.uk/media-10-buys-ideal-home-show/3003923.article|title=Media 10 buys Ideal Home Show|first=Branwell|last=Johnson|work=Marketing Week|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=1 June 2010}}</ref>

On 25 October 1924 the ''Daily Mail'' published the forged [[Zinoviev letter]], which indicated that British Communists were planning violent revolution. This was thought by some a significant factor in the defeat of [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1924|1924 general election]], held four days later.<ref name="Nicholson2009">{{Cite book|title=Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, the End of Civilization|author=Nicholson Baker|year=2009|page=12|isbn=1-4165-6784-4}}</ref>

From 1923 Lord Rothermere and the ''Daily Mail'' formed an alliance with the other great press baron, [[Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]]. Their opponent was the Conservative Party politician and leader [[Stanley Baldwin]]. By 1929 [[George Ward Price]] was writing in the ''Mail'' that Baldwin should be deposed and Beaverbrook elected as leader. In early 1930 the two Lords launched the [[United Empire Party]] which the ''Daily Mail'' supported enthusiastically.
[[File:SAM 0307.jpg|thumb|left|A page from the ''Daily Mail'' Silver Jubilee Issue, 1935]]

The rise of the new party dominated the newspaper and, even though Beaverbrook soon withdrew, Rothermere continued to campaign. Vice Admiral [[Ernest Augustus Taylor]] fought the first by-election for the [[United Empire Party]] in October, defeating the official Conservative candidate by 941 votes. Baldwin's position was now in doubt, but in 1931 [[Duff Cooper]] won the key [[Westminster St George's by-election, 1931|by-election at St George's, Westminster]], beating the United Empire Party candidate, Sir [[Ernest Petter]], supported by Rothermere, and this broke the political power of the press barons.<ref name="Dennis2006">{{Cite book|title=Fleet Street|chapter=13.

In 1927, the celebrated picture of the year ''[[:File:Proctor-Morning.jpg|Morning]]'' by [[Dod Procter]] was bought by the ''Daily Mail'' for the [[Tate Gallery]].<ref name="Company2003">{{Cite book|title=The Houghton Mifflin dictionary of biography|page=1241|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QfesntdNnbwC|isbn=978-0-618-25210-7|year=2003|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}</ref>

====Support of fascism====

''[[The Spectator]]'' condemned Rothermere's article commenting that, "...the Blackshirts, like the Daily Mail, appeal to people unaccustomed to thinking.

===Post-war history===
On 5 May 1946 the ''Daily Mail'' celebrated its Golden Jubilee. [[Winston Churchill]] was the chief guest at the banquet and toasted it with a speech:<ref name=FS311/>

{{quote box|I remember lunching at [[Londonderry House]] on the day when the ''Daily Mail'' first came out, and Alfred Harmsworth sat as the guest of honour at a very small party—a very remarkable man, a man of great influence and independence. In a free country where enterprise can make its way, he was able to create this enormous, lasting, persuasive and attractive newspaper which had its influence in our daily lives and with which we have walked along the road for 50 years.}}

In reply, [[Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere]] had something to say about the newsprint shortages at that time for, while the ''Mail'' of 1896 was eight pages, the ''Mail'' of 1946 was reduced to just four.<ref name=FS311>{{Cite book|title=Fleet Street|author=Dennis Griffiths|publisher=The British Library|page=311|isbn=0-7123-0697-8}}</ref>

The ''Daily Mail'' was transformed by its editor during the 1970s and 1980s, <!-- Not knighted until 1982, mentioned later. -->[[David English (editor)|David English]]. He had been editor of the ''[[Daily Sketch]]''  from 1969 to 1971, when it closed. Part of the same group from 1953, the ''Sketch'' was absorbed by its sister title, and English became editor of  the ''Mail'', a post in which he remained for more than 20 years.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Dennis|title=The Encyclopedia of the British Press, 1422–1992|publisher=Macmillan|location=London & Basingstoke|year=1992|pages=182, 187}}</ref> English transformed it from a struggling newspaper selling half as many copies as its mid-market rival, the ''[[Daily Express]]'', to a formidable publication, whose circulation rose to surpass that of the ''Express'' by the mid-1980s.<ref name="Lancaster">{{cite news|last=Lancaster|first=Terence|url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-sir-david-english-1164350.html|title= Obituary: Sir David English|work=The Independent|date= 12 June 1998|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>  English was knighted in 1982.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ibrahim|first=Youssef M.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/12/business/sir-david-english-a-top-editor-on-fleet-street-is-dead-at-67.html|title=Sir David English, a Top Editor On Fleet Street, Is Dead at 67|work=New York Times|date=12 June 1998|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>

The paper enjoyed a period of journalistic success in the 1980s, employing some of the most inventive writers in old [[Fleet Street]] including the gossip columnist [[Nigel Dempster]], [[Lynda Lee-Potter]] and sportswriter [[Ian Wooldridge]] (who unlike some of his colleagues—the paper generally did not support [[Sporting boycott of South Africa during the Apartheid era|sporting boycotts of white-minority-ruled South Africa]]—strongly opposed [[apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]]).

===''Irish Daily Mail''===
{{main|Irish Daily Mail}}
The ''Daily Mail'' officially entered the Irish market with the launch of a local version of the paper on 6 February 2006; free copies of the paper were distributed on that day in some locations to publicise the launch. Its masthead differed from that of UK versions by having a green rectangle with the word "IRISH", instead of the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|Royal Arms]], but this was later changed, with "Irish Daily Mail" displayed instead. The Irish version includes stories of Irish interest alongside content from the UK version. According to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, the Irish edition had a circulation of 63,511 for July 2007,<ref name="abc-ireland">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc-ireland.ie/|title=Audit Bureau of Circulations|publisher=ABC|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref> falling to an average of 49,090 for the second half of 2009.<ref name="Ref_2010">{{cite news|title=Fall in circulation for all of Republic's daily newspapers|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2010/0219/1224264797737.html|date=19 February 2010|accessdate=17 July 2010|newspaper=The Irish Times }}</ref> Since 24 September 2006 ''[[Ireland on Sunday]]'', the Irish Sunday newspaper acquired by Associated in 2001, was replaced by an Irish edition of the ''Mail on Sunday'' (the ''Irish Mail on Sunday''), to tie in with the weekday newspaper.

===''Continental'' and ''Overseas Daily Mail''===
Two foreign editions were begun in 1904 and 1905; the former titled the ''Overseas Daily Mail'', covering the world, and the latter titled the ''Continental Daily Mail'', covering Europe and North Africa.<ref name=OCDM>{{Cite journal |first=Frederick Arthur|last=MacKenzie |title=The Mystery of the Daily Mail: 1896–1921 |publisher=Associated Newspapers |location=London| year=1921|pages=55–58}}</ref>

===''Mail Today''===
{{main|Mail Today}}
The newspaper entered India on 16 November 2007 with the launch of ''Mail Today'',<ref name="mailtoday">{{cite web|url=http://www.mailtoday.in/|title=''Mail Today''|publisher=Mailtoday|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref> a 48-page compact size newspaper printed in Delhi, Gurgaon and Noida with a print run of 110,000 copies. Based around a subscription model, the newspaper has the same fonts and feel as the ''Daily Mail'' and was set up with investment from Associated Newspapers and editorial assistance from the ''Daily Mail'' newsroom.<ref name="thomascrampton">{{cite web|url=http://www.thomascrampton.com/media/thomas-jacob-mail-todays-india-newspaper-ifra/|title=Associated Newspapers launches Mail Today in India|publisher=Thomas Crampton|date=3 April 2008|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>

==Editorial stance==

In the late 1960s, the paper went through a phase of being liberal on social issues like corporal punishment,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} but soon returned to a conservative line. The ''Mail'' has traditionally been a supporter of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and has endorsed this party in all recent general elections. While the paper retained its support for the Conservative Party at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]], the paper urged conservatively inclined voters to support [[UKIP]] in the constituencies of [[Heywood and Middleton]], [[Dudley North (UK Parliament constituency)|Dudley North]] and [[Great Grimsby (UK Parliament constituency)|Great Grimsby]] where UKIP was the main challenger to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref>Urges conservatively inclined voters to support UKIP in Heywood and Middleton, Dudley North and Great Grimsby</ref>

The paper is generally critical of the [[BBC]], which it says is biased to the left.<ref name="Ref_n">Douglas, Torin (18 June 2007). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6764779.stm Does the BBC have a bias problem?]. [[BBC News]].</ref> The ''Mail'' has also opposed the growing of [[genetically modified crops]] in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blythman|first=Joanna|title=Vandals! No, not protesters trashing crops but the GM lobby still trying to force increasingly discredited Frankenstein Food down our throats|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2151380/GM-lobby-trying-force-increasingly-discredited-Frankenstein-Food-throats.html|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=28 May 2012|location=London}}</ref>

On international affairs, the ''Mail'' broke with the establishment media consensus over the [[Russia–Georgia war|2008 South Ossetia war]] between Russia and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. The ''Mail'' accused the British government of dragging Britain into an unnecessary confrontation with Russia and of hypocrisy regarding its protests over Russian recognition of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]]'s independence, citing the British government's own recognition of [[Kosovo]]'s independence from Russia's ally [[Serbia]].<ref name="Ref_2008">{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1050075/MAIL-COMMENT-Is-Miliband-talking-war.html|title=Mail comment: Is Miliband talking us into another war?|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=28 August 2008|accessdate=29 August 2008 |location=London}}</ref>

[[Melanie Phillips]], once known for her journalism at ''[[The Guardian]]'', moved to the right in the 1990s and wrote for the ''Daily Mail'', covering political and social issues from a [[Social conservatism|conservative]] perspective. She has defined herself as a [[classical liberalism|liberal]] who has "been mugged by reality".<ref name="Beckett">Andy Beckett [http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/mar/07/dailymail.pressandpublishing/print "The changing face of Melanie Phillips"], ''The Guardian'', 7 March 2003</ref> Phillips' Monday column in the ''Mail'' ended in September 2013.<ref>William Turvill [http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/melanie-phillips-bows-out-after-12-years-mail-columnist-dominic-lawson-tipped-replace-her "Melanie Phillips bows out after 12 years as Mail columnist, Dominic Lawson tipped to replace her"], ''Press Gazette'', 12 September 2013</ref>

The Mail's science journalism often follows a strategy of attention-grabbing headlines, often reporting on small studies of limited value for research.<ref name="Bad science">{{cite book|last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben|title=Bad science|date=2008|publisher=Fourth Estate|location=London|isbn=9780007240197}}</ref> In 2010, physician [[Ben Goldacre]] commented that its health reporting was an "ongoing project to divide all the inanimate objects in the world into ones that either cause or prevent cancer."<ref name="The Daily Mail cancer story that torpedoes itself in paragraph 19">{{cite web|last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben|title=The Daily Mail cancer story that torpedoes itself in paragraph 19|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/oct/16/ben-goldacre-bad-science-daily-mail-cancer|website=The Guardian|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref>

==Notable stories==

===Holes in the road===
On 17 January 1967, the ''Mail'' published a story, "The holes in our roads", about [[pothole]]s, giving the examples of [[Blackburn]] where it said there were 4,000 holes. This detail was then immortalised by [[John Lennon]] in [[The Beatles]] song "[[A Day in the Life]]", along with an account of the death of 21-year-old [[socialite]] [[Tara Browne]] in a car crash on 18 December 1966, which also appeared in the same issue.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Origins of "A Day In The Life"|publisher=Apple Corps|work=The Beatles: Selected Items from my Personal Memorabilia Collection}}</ref>

===Unification Church===
In 1981, the ''Daily Mail'' ran an investigation into the [[Unification Church]], nicknamed the Moonies, and branded them a church that ends marriages in an article which also accused them of brainwashing converts.<ref name="Lancaster"/> The Unification Church, which always denied brainwashing, sued for libel and lost heavily. A jury awarded the ''Mail'' a record-breaking £750,000—then the biggest libel payout. In 1983 the paper won a special [[British Press Awards|British Press Award]] for a "relentless campaign against the malignant practices of the Unification Church."<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?&dat=19810401&id=RbdAAAAAIBAJ&pg=2933,27383 "£750,000 in costs as Moonies lose marathon libel action", ''Glasgow Herald'', 1 April 1981. p. 3]</ref>

===Gay gene controversy===

===Stephen Lawrence===
The ''Mail'' campaigned on the case of [[Murder of Stephen Lawrence|Stephen Lawrence]], a black teenager who was murdered in a racially motivated attack in [[Eltham, London]] in April 1993. On 14 February 1997, the ''Mail'' led its front page with a picture of the five men accused of Lawrence's murder and the headline "MURDERERS", stating that it believed that the men had murdered Lawrence and adding "if we are wrong, let them sue us".<ref name="Ref_p">May, Margaret; Page, Robert M.; Brunsdon, Edward (2001).

===Jan Moir===
A 16 October 2009 [[Jan Moir]] article which criticised aspects of the life and death of [[Stephen Gately]], published six days after his death and before his funeral, the content and/or timing of which many people felt was inaccurate, insensitive, and [[Homophobia|homophobic]], generated over 25,000 complaints, the highest number of complaints for a newspaper article in the history of the [[Press Complaints Commission]].<ref>{{Cite news|title = Daily Mail column on Stephen Gately death provokes record complaints|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/oct/16/stephen-gately-boyzone|location=UK|first=Robert|last=Booth|date=16 October 2009|accessdate=30 April 2010|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Irish Daily Mail disowns Jan Moir|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/20/jan-moir-irish-daily-mail|location=UK|first=Stephen|last=Brook|date=20 October 2009|accessdate=30 April 2010|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> Major advertisers such as [[Marks & Spencer]] responded to the criticism by asking for their own adverts to be removed from the ''Mail Online'' webpage around Moir's article.
