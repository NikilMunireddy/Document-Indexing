'''Anastasia Ivanovna Rodionova''' ({{lang-ru|Анастасия Ивановна Родионова}}; born 12 May 1982 in [[Tambov]]) is a Russian-born Australian professional [[tennis]] player.

Rodionova has won nine doubles titles on the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tour, as well as eight singles and thirteen doubles titles on the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] tour in her career. On 16 August 2010, she reached her best singles ranking of world number 62. On 8 September 2014, she peaked at world number 15 in the doubles rankings.

Rodionova's greatest career achievements have come in doubles, having reached the finals of the Mixed Doubles event at the [[2003 Wimbledon Championships]] with [[Andy Ram]] and the semifinals of the Women's Doubles event at the [[2010 US Open (tennis)|2010 US Open]] with [[Cara Black]].

Rodionova's younger sister [[Arina Rodionova|Arina]] is also a tennis professional, and the two sisters have intermittently contested doubles tournaments with modest success. Their most notable achievements as a team came at the [[2010 Malaysian Open]] and [[2015 Monterrey Open]], succumbing in the super tie-break in the finals of both tournaments.

==Biography==
Rodionova started to play tennis at age 7, but she was introduced to tennis much earlier.  Her father Ivan was an amateur player so instead of toys, Rodionova had tennis balls in her pram. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}  He coached her until 18 years old when she left Tambov, Russia and moved to Germany to practice for 3 years before returning to Moscow to live in 2003. She has resided in Melbourne, Australia since 2005. Rodionova's sister [[Arina Rodionova|Arina]] has also been a professional tennis player since 2004.

==Career==
[[File:Anastassia Rodionova.jpg|thumb|Rodionova at 2004 US Open]]

===2006–2007===
In 2006, after reaching the 2nd round in the 2nd tier tournament in Los Angeles, Rodionova entered the Top 100 WTA rankings for the first time in her career. At the US Open she became one of the leading players after making it to the 3rd round (her best result in singles at a Grand Slam tournament to date). This catapulted Rodionova to 81 in the world. In doubles with Elena Vesnina she also reached the WTA tournament final in Bangalore, India and she captured her 11th ITF title in Italy in partnership with her sister Arina Rodionova. 
In 2007 Rodionova played a whopping 28 WTA tournaments. At the Australian Open Grand Slam she reached the 2nd round but lost to world number 2 and eventual finalist, [[Maria Sharapova]]. In Miami's Tier 1 tournament Rodionova took more games off the eventual tournament champion [[Serena Williams]] in her 2nd round defeat than any other person in that tournament. In the Estoril Open, Portugal, Rodionova won her 2nd title in doubles with [[Andreea Ehritt-Vanc]] from Romania. Together they also made the finals in Morocco. In the 1st tier tournament in Los Angeles Rodionova made the semi-finals, partnering with [[Tatiana Poutchek]]. In Guangzhou, China Rodionova reached the singles semi-final but was unable to finish the match due to heat stroke. At the Tashkent Open, Rodionova once again teamed up with Tatiana Poutchek making the final, but lost in 3 sets to [[Ekaterina Dzehalevich]] and [[Anastasiya Yakimova]]. Rodionova ended the year ranked 78th place in singles.

===2008===
Rodionova started the new 2008 season in New Zealand, but it began unsuccessfully as she was forced to retire in the opening round due to eye problems, where she was experiencing double vision. After a short-course of treatment in Melbourne,  Rodionova began preparations for the Australian Open. There she played under the Australian flag for the first time and reached the 2nd round, losing to Katarina Srebotnik. ((cn)) In the next few tournaments of Pattaya, Doha and Dubai Rodionova struggled with her vision with three 1st round defeats in singles, but made a doubles semi-final with Arina at the Pattaya Open. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Then success increased remarkably, resulting in her gaining several considerable victories over the multiple top 30 players. In India she defeated the number 20 in the world Sybille Bammer from Austria on the way to the quarter-final, where she went down to Serena Williams. She carried that confidence through the USA series, passing qualification in Miami and reaching the 2nd round and making the 3rd round in Charleston, losing to [[Jelena Janković]].

May 2008 saw the beginning of a spate of injuries that significantly hampered the rest of her year, taking 1st round honours in tournaments that she would have otherwise performed much more brightly. Movement did not restrict her as much in doubles and she made quarter finals in a Moscow ITF, semi-finals in New Haven, 3rd round in the US Open, and semi-final in Guangzhou. However, it was clear that without major hip surgery, Rodionova's career would forever be handicapped so in September she underwent a specialised operation in Melbourne and spent the remainder of the year in rehabilitation. {{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Rodionova underwent major hip surgery in September 2008 in Melbourne<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/sport/tennis/injured-rodionova-on-the-mend-for-open/2008/09/29/1222650989796.html "Injured Rodionova on the mend for Open"]</ref> to treat an injury that she had carried since Wimbledon 2003.

===2009===
Results were restricted significantly for the first half of the year while Rodionova strengthened her hip and built on-court fitness following the major hip operation in September 2008.  She sustained a badly sprained ankle during  1st round singles at Los Angeles in July and was forced to retire.  Rodionova represented Australia at the US Open and equalled her career best 3rd round in singles before returning home to Melbourne to receive intensive treatment on a heavily injured ankle and torn leg muscle.  She withdrew from the tournament in Seoul to complete treatment and rejoined the WTA Tour in Tokyo, Japan.  Rodionova's final tournament for 2009 was in Poiters, France and she ended her season ranked back inside the Top 100 at 97.

===2014===
While in singles she continued playing in the style of the previous season, Rodionova showed progressive results in doubles, when partnering with [[Alla Kudryavtseva]] the duo claimed three out of four tournaments. They also reached semifinals of [[2014 China Open – Women's Doubles|Beijing]] and [[2014 Western & Southern Open – Women's Doubles|Cincinnati]], and quarterfinals of [[2014 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles|Wimbledon]], [[2014 Sony Open Tennis – Women's Doubles|Miami]], [[2014 Qatar Total Open – Doubles|Doha]] and [[2014 Wuhan Open – Doubles|Wuhan]]. That gave the pair a ticket to the [[2014 WTA Finals|Championships]] in Singapore, where they beat in the quarterfinals fourth seeded [[Ekaterina Makarova|Makarova]]/[[Elena Vesnina|Vesnina]], 4–6, 6–2, [10–6]. In the semifinals they were defeated by title defenders Su-wei/Shuai, 1–6, 4–6.

Her best singles result came at the [[2014 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], where she qualified and defeated [[Camila Giorgi]] before losing a close match to No.13 seed [[Sara Errani]] in round 2, 4-6, 6-7.
