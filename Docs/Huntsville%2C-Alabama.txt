'''Huntsville''' is a city located primarily in [[Madison County, Alabama|Madison County]] in the central part of the far northern region of the [[U.S. State]] of [[Alabama]]. Huntsville is the [[county seat]] of Madison County.<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=June 7, 2011|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> The city extends west into neighboring [[Limestone County, Alabama|Limestone County]].<ref>[http://www.huntsvilleal.gov/about/index.php "About Huntsville"].

==History==

===First settlers===
The first settlers of the area were [[Muscogee people|Muscogee-speaking people]].<ref>http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/early_indian_east.jpg</ref>  The [[Chickasaw]] traditionally claim to have settled around 1300 after coming east across the Mississippi.  A combination of factors, including depopulation due to disease, land disputes between the Choctaw and Cherokee, and pressures from the United States government had largely depopulated the area prior to [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] veteran John Hunt's arrival and settlement in the land around the [[Big Spring Park (Huntsville, Alabama)|Big Spring]] in 1805. The [[Chickasaw#Treaties|1805 Treaty with the Chickasaws]] and the [[Cherokee treaties|Cherokee Treaty of Washington of 1806]] ceded native claims to the United States Government.  The area was subsequently purchased by [[LeRoy Pope]], who named the area [[Twickenham]] after the home village of his distant kinsman [[Alexander Pope]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/huntsville/hsv_history.html |title=Notes on the History of Huntsville |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:BigSpring.jpg|thumb|left|The Big Spring, basis of street plan in Twickenham (renamed "Huntsville" in 1812)]]

Twickenham was carefully planned, with streets laid out on the northeast to southwest direction based on the Big Spring. However, due to anti-British sentiment during this period, the name was changed to "Huntsville" to honor John Hunt, who had been forced to move to other land south of the new city.<ref>Record, James, and John McCormick; "Huntsville, Alabama: Rocket City, U.S.A.", pamphlet published in 1953 by Strode Publishers</ref>

Both John Hunt and LeRoy Pope were [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and charter members of [[Helion Lodge|Helion Lodge #1]].<ref name=helion>{{cite web|author=Toby Norris |url=http://www.helionlodge.org/ |title=Helion Lodge #1, Huntsville, Alabama |publisher=Helionlodge.org |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>

===Incorporation===
In 1811, Huntsville became the first incorporated town in Alabama. However, the recognized "birth" year of the city is 1805, the year of John Hunt's arrival. The city's [[sesquicentennial]] anniversary was held in 1955, and the [[wikt:bicentennial|bicentennial]] was celebrated in 2005.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Emerging industries===
Huntsville's quick growth was from wealth generated by the [[cotton]] and [[railroad]] industries. Many wealthy planters moved into the area from [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[the Carolinas]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 1819, Huntsville hosted a constitutional convention in Walker Allen's large cabinetmaking shop. The 44 delegates meeting there wrote a constitution for the new state of [[Alabama]]. In accordance with the new state constitution, Huntsville became Alabama's first capital when the state was admitted to the Union. This was a temporary designation for one legislative session only, and the capital was then moved to [[Cahaba, Alabama|Cahawba]], then to [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], and finally to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1855, the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]] was constructed through Huntsville, becoming the first railway to link the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic seacoast]] with the lower [[Mississippi River]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Civil War===
[[File:Huntsville AL USA 1871 Birds Eye View.jpg|thumb|left|Bird's eye view of 1871 Huntsville, Alabama]]

Huntsville initially opposed [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in 1861, but provided many men for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy's]] efforts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The 4th Alabama Infantry Regiment, led by Col. Egbert J. Jones of Huntsville, distinguished itself at the [[First Battle of Bull Run|Battle of Manassas/Bull Run]], the first major encounter of the [[American Civil War]]. The Fourth Alabama Infantry, which contained two Huntsville companies, were the first Alabama troops to fight in the war and were present when [[Robert E. Lee|Lee]] surrendered to [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] at [[Old Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]] in April 1865. Eight generals of the war were born in or near Huntsville, evenly split with four on each side.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

On the morning of April 11, 1862, [[Union Army|Union]] troops led by General [[Ormsby M. Mitchel]] seized Huntsville in order to sever the Confederacy's rail communications and gain access to the Memphis & Charleston Railroad. Huntsville was the control point for the Western Division of the Memphis &Charleston,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Alabama Railroads|last=Cline|first=Wayne|publisher=The University of Alabama Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Tuscaloosa|pages=4}}</ref> and by controlling this railroad the Union had a direct connection to Charleston South Carolina.

During the first occupation, the Union officers occupied many of the larger homes in the city while the other men camped on the outskirts.  In the initial occupation, the Union troops searched for both Confederate troops hiding in the town and weapons.  After they had established themselves, the occupying federals did not burn or pillage the city of Huntsville, though towns around it were sometimes targeted.  Treatment toward the town was actually civil.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Incidents of the War: the Civil War Journal of Mary Jane Chadick|last=Chadick|first=Mary Jane|publisher=Silver Threads Publishing|year=2005|isbn=|editor-last=Rohr|editor-first=Nancy|location=Huntsville|pages=}}</ref>

The Union troops were forced to retreat some months later, but returned to Huntsville in the fall of 1863 and thereafter used the city as a base of operations for the remainder of the war. While many homes and villages in the surrounding countryside were burned in retaliation for the active [[guerrilla warfare]] in the area, Huntsville itself was spared because it housed elements of the Union Army.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===After the Civil War===
[[File:Child workers in Huntsville, Alabama.jpg|thumb|[[child labour|Child workers]] at Merrimac Mills in Huntsville, November 1910, photographed by [[Lewis Hine]]]]

After the Civil War, Huntsville became a center for [[cotton]] [[textile mill]]s, such as Lincoln, [[Dallas Mill|Dallas]] and Merrimack. Each mill had its own housing community that included everything the mill workers needed (schools, churches, grocery stores, theatres, and hardware stores, all within walking distance of the mill).{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Dairy cow [[Lily Flagg]] broke the world record for [[butter]] production in 1892, spawning an elaborate party wherein her Huntsville-resident owner General Samuel H. Moore painted his house butter yellow and arranged for electric lights for the dance floor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cookbookoftheday.blogspot.com/2010/04/huntsville-heritage-cookbook.html |title=Huntsville Heritage Cookbook |author=Lucinda |date=April 17, 2010 |work=Cookbook of the Day |publisher=Blogspot |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref> An area south of Huntsville was named Lily Flagg before 1906.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xxUlAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA29&dq=%22lily+flagg%22#v=onepage&q=%22lily%20flagg%22&f=false |title=Bulletin - United States Geological Survey, Volume 274 |author=United States Geological Society |year=1906 |accessdate=August 15, 2010}}</ref><ref name="sccc">{{cite web |url=http://www.springcity.org/history.stm |title=Early History of the Spring City Cycling Club |author=James Record |date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=November 18, 2011}}</ref> This area was later annexed into the city.

===Great Depression 1930s===
During the 1930s, industry declined in Huntsville due to the [[Great Depression]]. Huntsville became known as the [[Watercress]] Capital of the World<ref name="MSFC">{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/huntsville/hsv_history.html |title=NASA MSFC Notes on the History of Huntsville |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref> because of its abundant harvest in the area. Madison County led Alabama in cotton production during this time.<ref name=MSFC />

===World War II===
By 1940, Huntsville was still a small, quiet town with a population of about 13,000 inhabitants. This quickly changed in early 1941 when {{convert|35000|acre|km2}} of land adjoining the southwest area of the city was selected by the U.S. Army for building three [[chemical munitions]] facilities: the [[Huntsville Arsenal]], the Redstone Ordnance Plant (soon redesignated [[Redstone Arsenal]]), and the Gulf Chemical Warfare Depot. These operated throughout World War II, with combined personnel approaching 20,000.<ref>Baker, Michael; ''Redstone Arsenal: Yesterday and Today'', U.S. Government Printing Office, 1993-758-626/80050</ref>

===Missile development===
At the end of the war in 1945, the munitions facilities were no longer needed. They were combined with the designation Redstone Arsenal (RSA), and a considerable political and business effort was made in attempts to attract new tenants. One significant start involved manufacturing the [[Keller (automobile)|Keller automobile]], but this closed with only 18 vehicles built. With the encouragement of Senator [[John Sparkman]], the [[U.S. Army Air Force]] considered it for a major testing facility, but then selected another site. Redstone Arsenal was then prepared for disposal, but, again with assistance from Senator Sparkman, it was selected for the Army's rocket and missile development.<ref name="Baker, Op.Cet.">Baker, ''Op.Cet.''</ref>

[[File:Medaris vonBraun and Toftoy 01.jpg|thumb|right|RSA commander Maj. Gen. [[John Medaris]], [[Wernher von Braun]], and RSA deputy commander Brig. Gen. [[Holger Toftoy]] (l−r:) in the 1950s]]

In 1950, about 1,000 personnel were transferred from [[Fort Bliss]], Texas, to Redstone Arsenal to form the Ordnance Guided Missile Center (OGMC). Central to this was a group of German scientists and engineers led by [[Wernher von Braun]] that had originally been brought to America by Colonel [[Holger Toftoy]] under [[Operation Paperclip]]. As the [[Korean War]] started, the OGMC was given the mission to develop what eventually became the [[PGM-11 Redstone|Redstone Rocket]]. This rocket set the stage for America's space program, as well as major Army missile programs, to be centered in Huntsville. Toftoy, then a brigadier general, commanded OGMC and the overall Redstone Arsenal. In early 1956, the Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) under Major General [[John Bruce Medaris|John Medaris]] was formed.<ref name="Baker, Op.Cet."/>

===Space flight===
[[File:USSRC Rocket Park.JPG|thumb|left|Historic rockets in [[Rocket Park]] of the [[U.S. Space & Rocket Center|US Space and Rocket Center]], Huntsville, Alabama]]

The city is nicknamed "The Rocket City" for its close association with U.S. space missions. On January 31, 1958, ABMA placed America's first satellite, [[Explorer 1]], into orbit using a [[Jupiter-C]] launch vehicle, a descendant of the Redstone. This brought national attention to Redstone Arsenal and Huntsville, with widespread recognition of this being a major center for high technology.

On July 1, 1960, 4,670 civilian employees, associated buildings and equipment, and {{convert|1840|acre|km2}} of land transferred from ABMA to form NASA's [[George C. Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC). Wernher von Braun was MSFC's initial director. On September 8, President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] formally dedicated the MSFC.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/marshall/formation-msfc.html |title=Notes on Formation of the Marshall Center |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}</ref>

During the 1960s, the major mission of MSFC was in developing the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn boosters]] used by [[NASA]] in the [[Apollo program|Apollo Lunar Landing Program]]. For this, MSFC greatly increased its employees, and many new companies joined the Huntsville industrial community. The [[Cummings Research Park]] was developed just north of Redstone Arsenal to partially accommodate this industrial growth, and has now became the second largest research park of this type in America.

Huntsville's economy was nearly crippled and growth almost came to a standstill in the 1970s following the closure of the Apollo program. However, the emergence of the [[Space Shuttle]], the [[International Space Station]], and a wide variety of advanced research in space sciences led to a resurgence in NASA-related activities that has continued into the 21st century. In addition, new Army organizations have emerged at Redstone Arsenal, particularly in the ever-expanding field of [[missile defense]].

===Biotechnology===
There are over 25 biotechnology firms in Huntsville due to the Huntsville Biotech Initiative.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.huntsvilleal.gov/news/Mayor_Tommy_Battle_Announces_Huntsville_Biotech_Initiative_9_26_2014.php |title= Mayor Tommy Battle Announces Huntsville Biotech Initiative |work= HuntsvilleAL.gov |date = September 26, 2014}}</ref> The HudsonAlpha Institute is the centerpiece of the 150-acre Cummings Research Park Biotech Campus, part of the 4,000-acre [[Cummings Research Park]] which is second only to the North Carolina’s [[Research Triangle Park]] in land area.  The non-profit HudsonAlpha Institute has contributed [[genomics]] and [[genetics]] work to the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ([[ENCODE]]).  For-profit business ventures within the Biotech Campus focus on areas like infectious disease diagnostics, immune responses to disease and cancer, [[protein crystallization]], lab-on-a-chip technologies and improved agricultural technologies.<ref>{{cite web |author= Jeff Hansen |url= http://www.madeinalabama.com/2013/03/hudsonalpha-institute-builds-biotech-base/ |title= HudsonAlpha Institute builds base in Huntsville for biotech research |publisher= Alabama Department of Commerce |date= March 13, 2013}}</ref>

Situated in the [[Tennessee River]] valley, several [[plateau]]s and large hills partially surround Huntsville. These plateaus are associated with the [[Cumberland Plateau]], and are locally called "mountains". [[Monte Sano Mountain]] (Spanish for "Mountain of Health") is the most notable, and is east of the city along with Round Top (Burritt), Chapman, Huntsville, and Green mountains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monte Sano State Park|url=http://www.alapark.com/monte-sano-state-park|website=Alabama State Parks|publisher=Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources|accessdate=11 April 2016}}</ref> Others are Wade Mountain to the north, Rainbow Mountain to the west, and Weeden and Madkin mountains on [[Redstone Arsenal]] in the south. [[Brindley Mountain]] is visible in the south across the Tennessee River.

As with other areas along the Cumberland Plateau, the land around Huntsville is [[karst]] in nature. The city was founded around the Big Spring, which is a typical karst spring, and many [[cave]]s perforate the [[limestone]] bedrock underneath the surface, as is common in karst areas. The headquarters of the [[National Speleological Society]] are located in Huntsville.

===Climate===
[[File:Huntsville from Overlook.jpg|thumb|right|upright=2|A view of South Huntsville from atop [[Monte Sano Mountain]] ]]

Huntsville has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). It experiences hot, humid summers and generally mild winters, with average high temperatures ranging from near {{convert|90|°F|1|abbr=on}} in the summer to {{convert|49|°F|1|abbr=on}} during winter.

Huntsville is near the center of a large area of the U.S. mid-South that has maximum precipitation in the winter and spring, not summer. Average yearly precipitation is over 54 inches. On average, the wettest single month is December, but Huntsville experiences a prolonged slightly wetter season from November to May. The relatively drier months are from August to October.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}  Much of Huntsville's precipitation is delivered by [[thunderstorm]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Thunderstorms are most frequent during the summer but the most severe storms occur during the spring and late fall.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} These storms can deliver large [[hail]], damaging straight line winds and [[tornadoes]]. Huntsville lies in a region colloquially known as [[Dixie Alley]], an area more prone to violent, long track tornadoes than most other parts of the US.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rice|first=Doyle|title=Dixie Alley may see more tornado action than even Tornado Alley|url=http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/tornadoes/2011-04-25-tornado-dixie-alley.htm|accessdate=January 24, 2012|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=April 25, 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64wmEodru|archivedate=January 24, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Dixie Alley">{{cite web| last = Gerard| first = Alan|author2=John Gagan |author3=John Gordon | title = A Comparison of Tornado Statistics from Tornado Alley and Dixie Alley| publisher = National Weather Service| accessdate = January 24, 2012| date = October 17, 2005| url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/media/jan/tor_stats/DixieAlley_17Oct2005pm.ppt|format=PPT|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64wmNJ8u6|archivedate=January 24, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref>

On April 27, 2011, the largest tornado outbreak on record, the [[2011 Super Outbreak]], affected northern Alabama. During this event, an [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5]] tornado that tracked near the [[Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant]] destroyed many transmission towers and caused a multi-day power outage for the majority of [[North Alabama]]. Significant damage from that same tornado was also taken in the Anderson Hills subdivision and in [[Harvest, Alabama]]. In total, nine people were killed in [[Madison County, Alabama|Madison County]] alone and many others injured.<ref>{{cite web|author=Challen Stephens, The Huntsville Times |url=http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/04/friay_morning.html |title=Tornadoes now responsible for 9 deaths in Madison County, officials say|publisher=Blog.al.com |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref>  Other significant tornado events include the [[1974 Super Outbreak|Super Outbreak in April 1974]], the [[November 1989 Tornado Outbreak]] that killed 21 and injured almost 500, and the [[Anderson Hills Tornado]] that killed one and caused extensive damage in 1995.<ref name="tn740326">{{cite news|agency=The Associated Press|newspaper=''[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|The Times-News]]''|location=Hendersonville, NC|page=19|title=42 Persons Dead in Severe Storms, Tornadoes in Alabama|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=NfUZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QSQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6088,2888015&dq=national-weather-service+radio+huntsville&hl=en|date=March 25, 1974|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref><ref name="td040403">{{cite news|first=Dennis |last=Sherer|newspaper=''[[TimesDaily]]''|location=Florence, AL|page=B1 |title=Night of April 3, 1974, marked change in severe weather alerts, preparedness |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g_shAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qKMFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1409,304037|date=April 3, 2004|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}</ref> On January 21, 2010, Huntsville experienced a rare mid-winter tornado.

Since Huntsville is nearly {{convert|300|mi|km}} inland, [[hurricane]]s are rarely experienced with their full force; however, many weakened tropical storms cross the area after a [[U.S. Gulf Coast]] landfall. While most winters have some measurable snow, heavy snow is rare in Huntsville.  However, there have been some unusually heavy snowstorms, like the New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm, when {{convert|17|in|cm|0|abbr=on}} fell within 24 hours. Likewise, the [[Blizzard of 1993]] and the [[Groundhog Day]] snowstorm in February 1996 were substantial winter events for Huntsville. On Christmas Day 2010 Huntsville recorded over {{convert|4|in|cm}} of snow, and on January 9–10, 2011 it received from {{convert|8.9|in|cm}} at the airport to over {{convert|10|in|cm}} in the suburbs.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://blog.al.com/breaking/2011/01/snowfall_most_since_1988_in_hu.html|title = Snowfall most since 1988 in Huntsville, third-biggest on record|first = Steve|last = Doyle|date = January 10, 2011|publisher = [[The Huntsville Times]]|accessdate = October 4, 2011}}</ref>

==Politics and government==
[[File:Huntsville city hall.jpg|thumb|Huntsville's Administration Building, also known as City Hall]]

The current mayor of Huntsville is [[Tommy Battle]], who was first elected in 2008 and then re-elected in 2012. The City Administrator is John Hamilton, who replaced Rex Reynolds on January 1, 2014 when Reynolds retired.<ref>http://blog.al.com/breaking/2013/07/huntsville_city_administrator.html</ref> The city has a five-member/district City Council. The current members are:
*'''District 1''' (Northwest): Richard Showers, Sr.
*'''District 2''' (East): Mark Russell (President)
*'''District 3''' (Southeast): Dr. Jennie Robinson
*'''District 4''' (Southwest): Bill Kling, Jr.
*'''District 5''' (West): Will Culver

Council elections are "staggered", meaning that Districts 2, 3, and 4 had elections in August 2014, while Districts 1 and 5 will have elections simultaneously with mayoral elections in 2016.

The city has boards and commissions which control everything from schools and planning to museums and downtown development.

In July 2007 then Senator Barack Obama held the first fund raiser in Alabama for his Presidential campaign in Huntsville. Obama ended up winning the Alabama Democratic Primary and Madison County by large margins in 2008.  However, in the general election, John McCain carried Madison County with 57% of the vote.

====Public transit====
Public transit in Huntsville is run by the city's Department of Parking and Public Transit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsvcity.com/PublicTran/public_trans.php |title=Department of Parking and Public Transit |publisher=Hsvcity.com |accessdate=November 8, 2011}}</ref> The [[Huntsville Shuttle Bus|Huntsville Shuttle]] runs 11 fixed routes throughout the city, mainly around downtown and major shopping areas like [[Memorial Parkway (Huntsville)|Memorial Parkway]] and [[University Drive (Huntsville)|University Drive]] and has recently expanded some of the buses to include bike racks on the front for a trial program. A trolley makes stops at tourist attractions and shopping centers. The city runs HandiRide, a demand-response transit system for the handicapped, and RideShare, a county-wide carpooling program.

====Railroads====
Huntsville has two active commercial rail lines. The mainline is run by [[Norfolk Southern]], which runs from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The original depot for this rail line, the [[Huntsville Depot]], still exists as a [[railroad museum]], though it no longer offers passenger service.

Another rail line, formerly part of the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad|Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&N)]], successor to the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (NC&StL)]], is being operated by the [[Huntsville and Madison County Railroad Authority|Huntsville and Madison County Railroad Authority (HMCRA)]]. The line connects to the Norfolk Southern line downtown and runs {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} south, passing near Ditto Landing on the [[Tennessee River]], and terminating at Norton Switch, near Hobbs Island. This service, in continuous operation since 1894, presently hauls freight and provides [[transloading]] facilities at its downtown depot location. Until the mid-1950s, the L&N provided freight and passenger service to Guntersville and points South. The rail cars were loaded onto barges at Hobbs Island. The barge tows were taken upstream through the Guntersville Dam & Locks and discharged at Port Guntersville. Remnants of the track supporting piers still remain in the river just upstream from Hobbs Island. The service ran twice daily. L&N abandoned the line in 1984, at which time it was acquired by the newly created HMCRA, a state agency.

A third line, the Mercury and Chase Railroad, runs {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} weekend tourist rides on part of another former NC&StL and L&N line from the [[North Alabama Railroad Museum]]'s Chase Depot, located in the community of [[Chase, Alabama]]. The rail line originally connected Huntsville to NC&StL's Nashville-to-Chattanooga mainline in [[Decherd, Tennessee]]. The depot was once the smallest [[union station]] in the United States when it served the NC&StL and [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]], the predecessor to the Norfolk Southern.<ref>{{cite web
