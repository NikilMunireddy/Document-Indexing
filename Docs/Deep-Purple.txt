Deep Purple have had several line-up changes and an eight-year hiatus (1976–1984). The 1968–1976 line-ups are commonly labelled Mark I, II, III and IV.<ref>[http://www.ram.org/music/reviews/deep_purple.html Deep Purple reviews<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref><ref>[http://www.rock.co.za/files/marki.html Deep Purple Mark I & Mark II<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> Their second and most commercially successful line-up featured [[Ian Gillan]] (vocals), [[Jon Lord]] (organ), [[Roger Glover]] (bass), [[Ian Paice]] (drums), and [[Ritchie Blackmore]] (guitar). This line-up was active from 1969 to 1973, and was revived from 1984 to 1989, and again from 1992 to 1993. The band achieved more modest success in the intervening periods between 1968 and 1969 with the line-up including [[Rod Evans]] (vocals) and [[Nick Simper]] (bass, backing vocals), between 1974 and 1976 ([[Tommy Bolin]] replacing Blackmore in 1975) with the line-up including [[David Coverdale]] (vocals) and [[Glenn Hughes]] (bass, vocals), and between 1989 and 1992 with the line-up including [[Joe Lynn Turner]] (vocals). The band's line-up (currently featuring Ian Gillan, and guitarist [[Steve Morse]] from 1994) has been much more stable in recent years, although organist Jon Lord's retirement from the band in 2002 (being succeeded by [[Don Airey]]) left Ian Paice as the only original Deep Purple member still in the band.

==History==

===Beginnings (1967–68)===
In 1967 former [[The Searchers (band)|Searchers]] drummer [[Chris Curtis]] contacted London businessman Tony Edwards, in the hope that he would manage a new group he was putting together, to be called Roundabout.  Curtis' vision was a "supergroup" where the band members would get on and off, like a musical roundabout. Impressed with the plan, Edwards agreed to finance the venture with two business partners: [[John Coletta]] and Ron Hire, all of Hire-Edwards-Coletta (HEC) Enterprises.<ref name="Thompson">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Dave |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzzCw6xs9roC&pg=PA27 |title=Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story |accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref>

The first recruit to the band was the classically trained [[Hammond organ]] player [[Jon Lord]], Curtis' flatmate who had most notably played with the Artwoods (led by [[Art Wood]], brother of future Rolling Stones guitarist [[Ronnie Wood]], and featuring [[Keef Hartley]]).<ref>Eder, Bruce. [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p15491/biography The Artwoods] Allmusic. Retrieved 12 December 2011</ref> He was followed by guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]], who was persuaded to return from [[Hamburg]] to audition for the new group. Blackmore was making a name for himself as a studio session guitarist, and had also been a member of [[The Outlaws (UK band)|the Outlaws]], [[Screaming Lord Sutch]], and [[Neil Christian]]. Curtis' erratic behaviour and lifestyle, fueled by LSD use, caused a sudden disinterest in the project he had started, forcing HEC to dismiss him from Roundabout. But HEC was now intrigued with the possibilities Lord and Blackmore brought, while Lord and Blackmore were also keen to continue. The two carried on with recruiting additional members, keeping Tony Edwards as their manager.<ref name="Curtis">Thompson, Dave.

For the bass guitar, Lord suggested his old friend [[Nick Simper]], with whom he had played in a backing band for the vocal group [[The Flower Pot Men (band)|The Flower Pot Men]] (formerly known as [[The Ivy League (band)|the Ivy League]]) in 1967. Simper had previously been in [[Johnny Kidd and the Pirates]] and survived the car crash that killed Kidd. Simper had also known Blackmore since the early 1960s when his first band, the Renegades, debuted around the same time as one of Blackmore's early bands, the Dominators.<ref>Thompson, Dave (2004). "Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story" p.5. ECW Press</ref> [[Bobby Woodman]] was the initial choice for the drums, but during the auditions for a singer, [[Rod Evans]] of the Maze came in with his drummer, [[Ian Paice]]. Blackmore had seen Paice on tour with the Maze in Germany in 1966, and had been impressed by the 18-year-old's drumming. While Woodman was out for cigarettes, Blackmore quickly arranged an audition for Paice. Both Paice and Evans won their respective jobs, and the line-up was complete.<ref name="autogenerated1983">Welch, Chris. "The Story of Deep Purple."

In May 1968, the band moved into Pye Studios in London's [[Marble Arch]] to record their debut album, ''[[Shades of Deep Purple]]'', which was released in July by American label [[Tetragrammaton Records|Tetragammaton]], and in September by UK label [[EMI]].<ref name="Thompson2004">Thompson, Dave (2004).

Early in 1969, the band recorded a single called "Emmaretta", named after Emmaretta Marks, then a cast member of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', whom Evans was trying to seduce.<ref>Thompson, Dave (2004). "Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story" p.324. ECW Press</ref> By March of that year, the band had completed recording for their third album, ''[[Deep Purple (album)|Deep Purple]]''. The album contained strings and woodwind on one track ("April"), showcasing Lord's classical antecedents such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], and several other influences were in evidence, notably [[Vanilla Fudge]]. (Lord and Blackmore had even claimed the group wanted to be a "Vanilla Fudge clone".)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehighwaystar.com/interviews/blackmore/rb199102xx.html |title=Ritchie Blackmore, Interviews |publisher=Thehighwaystar.com |date= |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> This would be the last recording by the original line-up.

Deep Purple's troubled North American record label, Tetragrammaton, delayed production of the ''Deep Purple'' album until after the band's 1969 American tour ended.  This, as well as lackluster promotion by the nearly broke label, caused the album to sell poorly, finishing well out of the ''Billboard'' Top 100. Soon after the third album's eventual release, Tetragrammaton went out of business, leaving the band with no money and an uncertain future. (Tetragrammaton's assets were assumed by [[Warner Bros. Records]], who would release Deep Purple's records in the US throughout the 1970s.) During the 1969 American tour, Lord and Blackmore met with Paice to discuss their desire to take the band in a heavier direction.  Feeling that Evans and Simper would not fit well with a heavy rock style, both were replaced that summer.<ref>Joel Whitburn (2007). "The Billboard Albums: Includes Every Album That Made the Billboard 200 Chart". p.227. Record Research Inc., 2007</ref> Paice stated, "A change had to come. If they hadn't left, the band would have totally disintegrated." Both Simper and Blackmore noted that Rod Evans already had one foot out the door. Simper said that Evans had met a girl in Hollywood and had eyes on being an actor, while Blackmore explained, "Rod just wanted to go to America and live in America."<ref name="Rosen Interview 1">[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-xzGcPwjw Steve Rosen Interview with Ritchie Blackmore, 1974] Retrieved from YouTube "Ritchie Blackmore, Guitar God|Part 1/5" on 14 January 2014.</ref>

[[File:Deep Purple, Ritchie Blackmore 1970.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ritchie Blackmore]] in Hannover, Germany, 1970]]
In search of a replacement vocalist, Blackmore set his own sights on 19-year-old singer [[Terry Reid]]. Though he found the offer "flattering", Reid was still bound by the exclusive recording contract with his producer [[Mickie Most]] and more interested in his solo career.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interview-singer-and-guitarist-terry-reid-455709.html |work=The Independent |location=London |title=Interview: Singer and guitarist Terry Reid |date=7 March 2007 |accessdate=23 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502125422/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/interview-singer-and-guitarist-terry-reid-455709.html |archivedate=2 May 2008 }}</ref> Blackmore had no other choice but to look elsewhere. The band hunted down singer [[Ian Gillan]] from [[Episode Six]], a band that had released several singles in the UK without achieving their big break for commercial success. Gillan had at one time been approached by Nick Simper when Deep Purple was first forming, but Gillan had reportedly told Simper that the Roundabout project would not go anywhere, while he felt Episode Six was poised to make it big.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=4459&type=1&lang=EN|title=Rockpages.gr interview with Nick Simper |last=Anasontzis |first=George |publisher=[[Rockpages]] |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref> Six's drummer [[Mick Underwood]] – an old comrade of Blackmore's from his days in [[The Outlaws (UK band)|the Outlaws]] – introduced the band to Gillan and bassist [[Roger Glover]]. This effectively killed Episode Six and gave Underwood a guilt complex that lasted nearly a decade, until Gillan recruited him for [[Gillan (band)|his new post-Purple band]] in the late 1970s. According to Blackmore, Deep Purple was only interested in Gillan and not Glover, but Roger was retained on the advice of Ian Paice.

{{Quote box|width=28%|align=right|quote="He turned up for the session...he was their [Episode Six's] bass player.  We weren't originally going to take him until Paicey said, 'he's a good bass player, let's keep him.' So I said okay."|source =— Ritchie Blackmore on the hiring of Roger Glover.<ref name="Rosen Interview 1"/>}}

This created the Deep Purple Mark II line-up, whose first release was a [[Roger Greenaway|Greenaway]]-[[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Cook]] tune titled "Hallelujah".<ref name="Hallelujah"/> At the time of its recording, Nick Simper still thought he was in the band, and had called the studio to inquire about the recording dates for the song. It was then he found that the song had already been recorded with Glover on bass. The remaining original members of Deep Purple then instructed management to inform Simper that he had been officially replaced.

Despite television appearances to promote the "Hallelujah" single in the UK, the song flopped.<ref name="Hallelujah"/> Blackmore had told the British weekly music newspaper ''[[Record Mirror]]'' they "need to have a commercial record in Britain", and described the song as "an in-between sort of thing"—a median between what the band would normally make but with an added commercial motive.<ref name="Hallelujah">Bloom, Jerry (2008). "Black Knight: Ritchie Blackmore" p.128. Omnibus Press, 2008</ref>

The band gained some much-needed publicity in September 1969, with the ''[[Concerto for Group and Orchestra]]'', a three-movement epic composed by Lord as a solo project and performed by the band at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London with the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Malcolm Arnold]].<ref name="Miles"/> Together with ''[[Days of Future Passed]]'' by [[the Moody Blues]] and ''[[Five Bridges]]'' by [[the Nice]], it was one of the first collaborations between a rock band and an orchestra.

Lord acknowledged that while the band members were not keen on the project going in, at the end of the performance "you could put the five smiles together, and it would have spanned the Thames." Lord would also write the ''[[Gemini Suite Live|Gemini Suite]]'', another orchestra/group collaboration in the same vein, for the band in late 1970. In 1975, Blackmore stated that he thought the ''Concerto for Group and Orchestra'' wasn't bad but the ''Gemini Suite'' was horrible and very disjointed.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steven Rosen |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |work=Guitar International |year=1975 |title=Ritchie Blackmore Interview: Deep Purple, Rainbow and Dio}}</ref> Roger Glover later claimed Jon Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band in the early years.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Highway Star: Deep Purple's Roger Glover Interviewed |work=The Quietus |date=20 January 2011 |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/05569-deep-purple-interview}}</ref>

Their first studio album of this period, released in mid-1970, was ''[[Deep Purple in Rock|In Rock]]'' (a name supported by the album's [[Mount Rushmore]]-inspired cover), which contained the then-concert staples "[[Speed King]]", "Into The Fire" and "[[Child in Time]]".

Within weeks of ''Fireball'''s release, the band were already performing songs planned for the next album. One song (which later became "[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]") was performed at the first gig of the ''Fireball'' tour, having been written on the bus to a show in Portsmouth, in answer to a journalist's question: "How do you go about writing songs?" Three months later, in December 1971, the band travelled to Switzerland to record ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]''. The album was due to be recorded at the [[Montreux Casino]], using the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]], but a fire during a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[the Mothers of Invention]] gig, caused by a man firing a flare gun into the ceiling, burned down the Casino. This incident famously inspired the song "[[Smoke on the Water]]". The album was later recorded in a corridor at the nearby empty Grand Hotel.<ref>(DVD) Classic Albums – Deep Purple – Machine Head, Eagle Rock Entertainment, 2002</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC.

[[File:David Coverdale.jpeg|thumb|right|upright|David Coverdale was the band's vocalist between August 1973 and March 1976]]
The band first hired Midlands bassist/vocalist [[Glenn Hughes]], formerly of [[Trapeze (band)|Trapeze]]. According to Ian Paice, Glover had told him and Lord a few months before his official resignation that he wanted to leave the band, so they had already started to drop in on Trapeze shows.

They settled on [[David Coverdale]], an unknown singer from [[Saltburn-by-the-Sea|Saltburn]] in Northeast England, primarily because Blackmore liked his masculine, blues-tinged voice.<ref name="vanderlee" />

Portions of the show were telecast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Television in the US, exposing the band to a wider audience. This line-up's first album, titled ''[[Burn (Deep Purple album)|Burn]]'', was a highly successful release, reaching No. 3 in the UK, No. 9 in the US, and was followed by another world tour.<ref name="OCC"/> The title track "Burn", which opens the album, was a conscious effort by the band to embrace the progressive rock movement that was popularised at the time by bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|ELP]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Gentle Giant]], etc. "Burn" was a complex arrangement which showcased all the band members' musical virtuosity and particularly Blackmore's classically influenced guitar prowess. The album also featured Hughes and Coverdale providing vocal harmonies and elements of funk and blues, respectively, to the band's music, a sound that was even more apparent on the late 1974 release ''[[Stormbringer (album)|Stormbringer]]''.<ref name="vanderlee" /> Besides the title track, the ''Stormbringer'' album had a number of songs that received much radio play, such as "Lady Double Dealer", "The Gypsy" and "Soldier of Fortune", and the album reached No. 6 in the UK and No. 20 on the US ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name="OCC"/> However, Blackmore publicly disliked the album and the funky soul elements, even calling it "shoeshine music".<ref>"History" track on the "Deep Purple: History and Hits" DVD.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Deep Purple – Stormbringer |work=Coffeerooms on Music |url=http://www.coffeerooms.com/onmusic/2009/04/deep-purple-stormbringer.html |date=1 April 2009 |author=Mike Jefferson}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Ritchie Blackmore Interview |work=Guitar International |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/09/14/ritchie-blackmore-the-rainbow-interview/ |author=Steven Rosen |year=1975}}</ref> As a result, he left the band on 21 June 1975 to form his own band with [[Ronnie James Dio]] of [[Elf (band)|Elf]], called Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, later shortened to [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] after one album.<ref>Dafydd Rees, Luke Crampton (1991).

With Blackmore's departure, Deep Purple was left to fill one of the biggest band member vacancies in rock music. In spite of this, the rest of the band refused to stop, and announced a replacement for Blackmore: American [[Tommy Bolin]]. Before Bolin was recruited, [[Clem Clempson]] (Colosseum, Humble Pie), [[Zal Cleminson]] (The Sensational Alex Harvey Band), [[Mick Ronson]] (David Bowie & The Spiders From Mars) and [[Rory Gallagher]] were considered for the part.<ref>Thompson, Dave (2004). ''Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story'', pp.179–180.</ref>

There are at least two versions about the recruitment of Bolin: Coverdale claims to have been the one who suggested auditioning Bolin.<ref>liner notes in the ''Deep Purple'' 4-CD boxed set.</ref> "He walked in, thin as a rake, his hair coloured green, yellow and blue with feathers in it. Slinking along beside him was this stunning Hawaiian girl in a crochet dress with nothing on underneath. He plugged into four [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] 100-watt stacks and...the job was his". But in an interview originally published by Melody Maker in June 1975, Bolin himself claimed that he came to the audition following a recommendation from Blackmore.<ref>{{cite web |author=Deep Purple Appreciation Society |url=http://www.deep-purple.net/interviews/tommy-bolin.htm |title=1975 Tommy Bolin interview |publisher=Deep-purple.net |date=28 June 1975 |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> Bolin had been a member of many now-forgotten late-1960s bands – Denny & The Triumphs, American Standard, and [[Zephyr (band)|Zephyr]], which released three albums from 1969 to 1972. Before Deep Purple, Bolin's best-known recordings were made as a session musician on [[Billy Cobham]]'s 1973 [[jazz fusion]] album ''[[Spectrum (Billy Cobham album)|Spectrum]]'', and as lead guitarist on two post-[[Joe Walsh]] [[James Gang]] albums: ''[[Bang (James Gang album)|Bang]]'' (1973) and ''[[Miami (James Gang album)|Miami]]'' (1974). He had also jammed with such luminaries as Dr. John, Albert King, [[the Good Rats]], Moxy and [[Alphonse Mouzon]], and was busy working on his first solo album, ''[[Teaser (Tommy Bolin album)|Teaser]]'', when he accepted the invitation to join Deep Purple.<ref name="Talevski"/>

The resulting album, ''[[Come Taste the Band]]'', was released in October 1975, one month before Bolin's ''Teaser'' album. Despite mixed reviews and so-so sales (#19 in the UK charts and No. 43 in the US Billboard charts), the collection revitalised the band once again, bringing a new, extreme funk edge to their [[hard rock]] sound.<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/g8fd Deep Purple Come Taste the Band: 35th Anniversary Edition Review] – [[BBC Music]]</ref> Bolin's influence was crucial, and with encouragement from Hughes and Coverdale, the guitarist developed much of the album's material. Despite Bolin's talents, his personal problems with hard drugs began to manifest themselves. During the ''Come Taste the Band'' tour, many fans openly booed Tommy's inability to play solos like Ritchie Blackmore, not realising that the former was physically hampered by his addiction. After several below-par concert performances, the band was in danger.

The decision to disband Deep Purple had been made some time before the last show by Lord and Paice (the last remaining original members), who hadn't told anyone else. The break-up was finally made public in July 1976, with then-manager Rob Cooksey issuing the simple statement: "the band will not record or perform together as Deep Purple again".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=LzzCw6xs9roC&pg=PA191&dq=deep+purple+liverpool+empire&hl=en&ei=XoWjTsXrK8ig8QOeur30BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=deep%20purple%20liverpool%20empire&f=false Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story] p.191.

After the break-up, most of the past and present members of Deep Purple went on to have considerable success in a number of other bands, including [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]], [[Whitesnake]] and [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]]. There were, however, a number of promoter-led attempts to get the band to reform, especially with the revival of the hard rock market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1980, a touring version of the band surfaced with Rod Evans as the only member who had ever been in Deep Purple, eventually ending in successful legal action from the legitimate Deep Purple camp over unauthorised use of the name. Evans was ordered to pay damages of US$672,000 for using the band name without permission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tinpan.fortunecity.com/aprilskies/65/dp1980.html |year=1998 |work=Captain Beyond website |title=ROD EVANS: The Dark Side of the Music Industry |author=Hartmut Kreckel}}</ref>

The Mark II line-up then released ''[[The House of Blue Light]]'' in 1987, which was followed by a world tour (interrupted after Blackmore broke a finger on stage while trying to catch his guitar after throwing it in the air) and another live album ''[[Nobody's Perfect (Deep Purple album)|Nobody's Perfect]]'' (1988) which was culled from several shows on this tour, but still largely based on the by-now familiar ''Made in Japan'' set-list. In the UK a new version of "Hush" (with Gillan on lead vocals) was released to mark 20 years of the band. In 1989 Gillan was fired as his relations with Blackmore had again soured and their musical differences had diverged too far.

With the tour complete, Turner was forced out, as Lord, Paice and Glover (and the record company) wanted Gillan back in the fold for the 25th anniversary.

Morse's arrival revitalised the band creatively, and in 1996 a new album titled ''[[Purpendicular]]'' was released, showing a wide variety of musical styles, though it never made chart success on the Billboard 200 in the US.<ref name="AllMusic.com"/> The Mark VII line-up then released a new live album ''[[Live at The Olympia '96]]'' in 1997. With a revamped set list to tour, Deep Purple enjoyed successful tours throughout the rest of the 1990s, releasing the harder-sounding ''[[Abandon (album)|Abandon]]'' in 1998, and touring with renewed enthusiasm. In 1999, Lord, with the help of a Dutch fan, who was also a musicologist and composer, [[Marco de Goeij]], painstakingly recreated the ''[[Concerto for Group and Orchestra]]'', the original score having been lost. It was once again performed at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in September 1999, this time with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by Paul Mann.<ref name="Buckley"/> The concert also featured songs from each member's solo careers, as well as a short Deep Purple set, and the occasion was commemorated on the 2000 album ''[[Live at the Royal Albert Hall (Deep Purple album)|Live at the Royal Albert Hall]]''.<ref name=Buckley>Buckley, Peter (2003).

Much of the next few years was spent on the road touring. The group continued forward until 2002, when founding member Lord (who, along with Paice, was the only member to be in all incarnations of the band) announced his amicable retirement from the band to pursue personal projects (especially orchestral work). Lord left his Hammond organ to his replacement, rock keyboard veteran [[Don Airey]] (Colosseum II, Rainbow, Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath, Whitesnake), who had helped Deep Purple out when Lord's knee was injured in 2001.  In 2003, Deep Purple released their first studio albums in five years (''[[Bananas (album)|Bananas]]'') and began touring in support of the album. [[EMI Records]] refused a contract extension with Deep Purple, possibly because of lower than expected sales. Actually ''[[In Concert with the London Symphony Orchestra]]'' sold more than ''Bananas''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist,2377.sm?id=70 |date=10 November 2005 |author=GARRY SHARPE-YOUNG |title=Roger Glover interview |work=[[Rockdetector]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209140852/http://www.rockdetector.com/interviews/artist,2377.sm?id=70 |archivedate=9 February 2006 }}</ref> Most of the songs played in their live concerts consist of classic 1970s material.
