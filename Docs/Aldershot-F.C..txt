'''Aldershot Football Club''' was an English [[the Football League|Football League]] club, which was wound up in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in March 1992. They became the first Football League club since [[Accrington Stanley F.C. (1891)|Accrington Stanley]] to resign from the League during the course of a season. The club was nicknamed ''The Shots'' for both the last syllable of the town name and the military links to [[Aldershot]]. Aldershot were also the first ever winners of a [[Football League play-offs|Football League play-off]] competition, when they beat [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the [[Division Four]] [[Football League Two play-offs|play-offs]] in 1987.

== History ==

=== Non League Years: 1926–1932 ===
The club was founded in 1926 as '''Aldershot Town FC''' when Jack White, a sports journalist persuaded council officials that the garrison town needed a professional football club. In 1927 the club joined the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]], playing their first game on 27 August 1927 in a 4–0 win over [[Grays Athletic]] in front of a 3,500-strong crowd at the [[Recreation Ground (Aldershot)|Recreation Ground]]. They finished their [[1927–28 in English football|first season]] in seventh place, and in 1932 won the Southern League title, being elected to [[the Football League]] in place of [[Thames A.F.C.|Thames]] who had declined to apply for re-election.<ref>http://www.shots2692.co.uk/</ref>  The name was changed to Aldershot prior to their inaugural 1932-33 League season.

=== Early league years: 1932–1958 ===
Aldershot's first Football League season ended with a 17th place in the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?competitionid=11&seasonid=62&teamid=92 |title=The Internet Soccer Database |publisher=soccerbase.com |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>  and a year later they improved slightly to finish 14th. They failed to make much of an impact in the league until they finished 11th in [[1935–36 in English football|1935–36]], but in [[1936–37 in English football|1936–37]] they finished bottom of the league and had to apply for re-election in order to avoid slipping back into the Southern League. Good progress over the next two seasons saw them climb to 10th in the league in the 1939 final table.<ref name="soccerbase1">{{cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/league2.sd?competitionid=11&seasonid=63&teamid=92 |title=The Internet Soccer Database |publisher=soccerbase.com |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>  Their 18th-place finish in 1958 meant that they would play in the new [[Football League Fourth Division]] in the [[1958–59 in English football|1958–59 season]], following a restructuring of [[the Football League]] which saw an end to the regionalised two sections of the Third Division.

=== The Fourth Division years: 1958–1973 ===
Aldershot F.C. were among the founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in the [[1958–59 in English football|1958–59 season]]. An FA Cup match against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] on 28 January 1970 saw Aldershot's record attendance of 19,138.

They finished 22nd in the [[1958–59 in English football|first season]] of the Fourth Division and once again had to apply for re-election.

Promotion to the Third Division was finally achieved in [[1972–73 in English football|1973]], their first promotion in 41 years of league football. They went up in fourth place after finishing ahead of [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] on goal average.<ref name="soccerbase1"/>

=== The Third Division years: 1973–1976  ===
[[1973–74 in English football|1973–74]] brought Aldershot's highest-ever finish as they came eighth in the Third Division. This gave hope that Aldershot could soon be playing [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] football – this was all the more anticipated as the mid to late 1970s saw several big clubs – including [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotpsur]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] – playing at least one season in the second tier.<ref name="soccerbase1"/>  However, it was not to be, as Aldershot finished 20th in the Third Division in [[1974–75 in English football|1975]] and only avoided relegation on goal average. They were relegated by a single point [[1975–76 in English football|the following year]].<ref name="soccerbase1"/>

=== Back in the Fourth Division: 1976–1985 ===
Two years after relegaton, Aldershot almost returned to the Third Division in 1978, but were pipped to promotion by [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]]. More significantly, they were also pipped to promotion by [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], who were both playing top division football within the next five years.<ref name="soccerbase1"/>  A similar disappointment followed a year later, as they were pipped to promotion by a single place – this time by a [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] side who were First Division members and [[FA Cup]] winners less than a decade later. On the plus side, Aldershot finished above two much more illustrious clubs – [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] and [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] – who were both former winners of the league title and [[FA Cup]].<ref name="soccerbase1"/>

In 1981, Aldershot suffered their third promotion disappointment in four seasons as they finished sixth – once again being beaten to a place in the top four by Wimbledon. In the [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]], Aldershot struggled badly and finished 16th. It was the first season of the Football League's "3 points for a win" system, and they finished just eight points outside the "re-election zone".<ref name="soccerbase1"/>

They continued to struggle in the Fourth Division, until the appointment of new manager [[Len Walker]] in June 1985.<ref name="soccerbase1"/>  However, [[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]] had brought a brief respite, as Aldershot finished fifth,<ref name="soccerbase1"/>  before another setback saw them finish 13th.<ref name="soccerbase1"/>

In [[1984–85 in English football|1984–85]], Aldershot took a young striker at the time on loan from [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] – [[Teddy Sheringham]], the future England international player. Millwall manager [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] had been willing to sell Sheringham to Aldershot on a permanent basis, but they could not raise the £5,000 fee.

=== The final years: 1985–1992===
The arrival of [[Len Walker]] as manager in June 1985 sparked a brief revival in Aldershot's fortunes. Although they finished 16th in [[1985–86 in English football|1985–86]] and re-election was a threat right up to the final few games of the season,<ref name="soccerbase1"/>  they emerged as strong promotion contenders in the [[1986–87 in English football|1986–87 season]], finishing sixth on 70 points and occupying the final playoff place in the division. It was the first season of the [[Football League play-offs]], which in their first two seasons operated as a promotion/relegation decider between the First/Second, Second/Third and Third/Fourth divisions before a reorganisation saw them operate solely as promotion deciders.<ref name="soccerbase1"/>  In the semi-finals, they condemned [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] (four times winners of the [[FA Cup]], and [[Football League First Division|First Division]] remembers as recently as 1980) to Fourth Division football for the first time in their history. This gave them a place in the final, against another historic side – [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], three times league champions, four times [[FA Cup]] winners, and twice [[Football League Cup]] winners, who had only been relegated from the top flight in 1984. Aldershot gave Wolves one of the most humiliating defeats of their history by winning 3–0 on aggregate over two legs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-england.com/aldershot_town.html |title=Aldershot Town Football Club |publisher=Football-england.com |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>

Aldershot were predicted to go straight back down to the Fourth Division in [[1987–88 in English football|1987–88]], but managed to avoid automatic relegation by two places and three points, finishing one point and one place ahead of the relegation play-off place.<ref name="soccerbase1"/>

However, a disastrous season in [[1988–89 in English football|1988–89]] saw Aldershot go down in bottom place with just eight wins and 37 points all season placing them 17 points adrift of safety.<ref name="soccerbase1"/>

By this stage, a financial crisis was dawning upon the club as debts were mounting and as the [[1989–90 in English football|1989–90 season]] began, the task at Aldershot was to avoid being relegated or expelled from the Football League, rather than mount a promotion challenge. Aldershot finished 22nd in the Fourth Division that season, and were in danger of a second successive relegation right up to the end of April.

However, the financial crisis was worsening and it seemed highly doubtful that Aldershot would be able to start the [[1990–91 in English football|1990–91 season]].<ref name="soccerbase1"/>

On 31 July 1990, Aldershot were wound up in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] as the [[Official Receiver]] condemned them as "financially insolvent" with debts of £495,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/756/38/ |title=When Saturday Comes – The Half Decent Football Magazine – Shots on target |publisher=Wsc.co.uk |date=25 March 1992 |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>  However, the winding-up order was lifted on 7 August 1990 when 19-year-old property developer [[Spencer Trethewy]] paid £200,000 to save the club and allow them to start the new Fourth Division campaign. However, the board of directors soon realised that he did not have the funds to keep the club running, and he was dismissed on 1 November 1990. Trethewy's shady dealings finally caught up with him in 1994 when he was convicted of fraud and received a two-year prison sentence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/article.asp?aid=580&iid=45&sud=478 |title=Welcome to the official web site of The Non-League Paper |publisher=Thenonleaguefootballpaper.com |date=28 October 2007 |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>

Aldershot's problems continued as they finished the 1990–91 season second from bottom in the league. They had taken in three new players near the end of the season in the form of Roger Davis, Dion Smith & Steve Batler. Changes which were too late to impact their results. There was no relegation this season due to an expansion in the league's size to 93 clubs from the previous total of 92.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/ALDERSHO.HTM |title=Football Club History Database – Aldershot |publisher=Fchd.info |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>

There was a brief respite for the club on 5 January 1991, when it held [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] to a surprise goalless draw in the [[FA Cup]] third round at [[Boleyn Ground|Upton Park]]. The Hammers won the replay 6–1 and went on to reach the semi-finals, also winning promotion to the First Division that season.<ref>[http://www.westhamunited-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadtmrs.asp?ssnno=120&teamno=551 Results Fixtures 1990–1991 West Ham United – West Ham United FC – Hammers Mad]. Westhamunited-mad.co.uk.</ref>

Len Walker had stepped up to the role of general manager in March 1991, with [[Brian Talbot]] taking over as player-manager.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keane |first=Matt |url=http://www.munster-express.ie/sports/soccer/a-hero-just-for-one-day/ |title=Munster Express Online » Archive » A hero just for one day? |publisher=Munster-express.ie |date=15 February 2008 |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>

However, Aldershot's debts were mounting and although they were able to begin the [[1991–92 in English football|1991–92]] Fourth Division campaign, as the season wore on it looked more and more likely that the club would go under. As well as that, the problems were showing on the field as Aldershot struggled near the foot of the league.

Manager [[Brian Talbot]] resigned in November 1991 to be succeeded by [[Ian McDonald (footballer, born 1953)|Ian McDonald]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shots2692.co.uk/managers.html |title=Aldershot F.C Team Managers |publisher=Shots2692.co.uk |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref>

On 25 March 1992 Aldershot F.C. finally went out of business and were obliged to resign from the Football League. The final game played was a 2–0 defeat against [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] at [[Ninian Park]] on 20 March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shots2692.co.uk/action912.html |title=Shots In Action 1991-2 |publisher=Shots2692.co.uk |accessdate=29 September 2009}}</ref> The last home game was a 3–0 defeat to [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], also in the league, on 14 March. Aldershot's final eight competitive games all ended in defeat and they had not won any of their final 16 games; their last competitive win was on 28 December 1991 away to [[Maidstone United F.C.|Maidstone United]] in the Fourth Division.<ref>[http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1991-92/ClubResults/1991-92Aldershot.html Aldershot results 1991/92]. footballsite.</ref> Ironically, Maidstone also went out of business and had to leave the Football League just five months after Aldershot's demise.<ref>[http://thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com/clubs/maidstone-united/ Maidstone United « The Beautiful History]. Thebeautifulhistory.wordpress.com (17 August 1992).</ref>

=== The new Aldershot club : Since 1992 ===
In response to the bankruptcy a group of supporters set up a new club, [[Aldershot Town F.C.|Aldershot Town]], which started in the [[Isthmian League Division Three]], [[English football league system|five levels]] below the division in which Aldershot F.C. had been playing. Aldershot Town were playing in [[Football League Two|League Two]] after being promoted on 15 April 2008, but their run came to an end after relegation to [[Conference Premier]] on 27 April 2013.
