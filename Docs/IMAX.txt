'''IMAX''' (an acronym for ''Image maximum'') is a motion picture [[film format]] and a set of cinema projection standards created by Canadian company [[IMAX Corporation]] and developed by [[Graeme Ferguson]], [[Roman Kroitor]], Robert Kerr, and William C. Shaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ieee.ca/millennium/imax/imax_birth.html |title=The Birth of IMAX |publisher=Ieee.ca |date= |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref> IMAX has the capacity to record and display images of far greater size and [[image resolution|resolution]] than conventional film systems. Since 2002, some feature films have been converted (or upgraded) into IMAX format for displaying in IMAX theatres and some have also been partially shot in IMAX.

IMAX is the most widely used system for special-venue film presentations. As of January 1, 2016, there are 1061 IMAX theatres in 67 countries.<ref name=results2015>{{cite press release|author1=IMAX Corporation|title=IMAX Corporation Reports Fourth-Quarter And Full-Year 2015 Financial Results|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/imax-corporation-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2015-financial-results-300225647.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=February 24, 2016|date=February 24, 2016}}</ref>

==History==
The desire to increase the visual impact of film has a long history. In 1929, [[Fox Film|Fox]] introduced [[70&nbsp;mm Grandeur film|Fox Grandeur]], the first [[70&nbsp;mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] film format, but it quickly fell from use.<ref>[[70 mm Grandeur film]]</ref> In the 1950s, the potential of [[35&nbsp;mm film]] to provide wider projected images was explored in the processes of [[CinemaScope]] (1953) and [[VistaVision]] (1954), following multi-[[Movie projector|projector]] systems such as [[Cinerama]] (1952). While impressive, Cinerama was difficult to install.

During [[Expo 67]] in Montreal, the [[National Film Board of Canada]]'s ''[[In the Labyrinth (film)|In the Labyrinth]]'' and Ferguson's ''Man and the Polar Regions'' both used multi-projector, multi-screen systems. Each encountered technical difficulties that led them to found a company called "Multiscreen", with a goal of developing a simpler approach. The single-projector/single-camera system they eventually settled upon was designed and built by Shaw based upon a novel "Rolling Loop" film-transport technology purchased from Peter Ronald Wright Jones, a machine shop worker from Brisbane, Australia (see {{US patent|3494524}}). As it became clear that a single, large-screen image had more impact than multiple smaller ones and was a more viable product direction, Multiscreen changed its name to IMAX.

''[[Tiger Child]]'', the first IMAX film, was demonstrated at [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka, Japan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/imax/imax_chronology.html |title=IMAX'S Chronology of Techonological (sic) Events |accessdate=February 23, 2010 |publisher=IEEE Canada, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers}}</ref> The first permanent IMAX installation was built at the [[Cinesphere]] theatre at [[Ontario Place]] in Toronto. It debuted in May 1971, showing the film ''[[North of Superior]]''. The installation is still in place,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/corporate/profile/historyMilestones/ |title=Corporate, History & Milestones | publisher=IMAX.com |date= |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> however, Ontario Place is on hiatus for redevelopment.

During [[Expo '74]] in [[Spokane, Washington]], an IMAX screen that measured {{convert|27|x|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} was featured in the US Pavilion (the largest structure in the expo). About five million visitors viewed the screen, which covered the viewer's total visual field when looking directly forward. This created a sensation of motion in most viewers, and [[motion sickness]] in some. An IMAX 3D theatre also is in operation near the former Expo 67 site at the [[Montreal Science Centre]] in the [[Port of Old Montreal]].

The first permanent IMAX Dome installation, the Eugene Heikoff and Marilyn Jacobs Heikoff Dome Theatre at the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]], opened in [[San Diego]]'s [[Balboa Park, San Diego, California|Balboa Park]] in 1973. It doubles as a [[planetarium]]. The first permanent IMAX 3D theatre was built in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia for ''[[Transitions (film)|Transitions]]'' at [[Expo '86]], and was in use until September 30, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.imax.com/vancouver/ |title=IMAX Theatre |publisher=Imax.com |date=October 1, 2009 |accessdate=July 3, 2010}} (official site).</ref> It was located at the tip of [[Canada Place]], a Vancouver landmark.

In 2008, IMAX extended their brand into traditional theaters with the introduction of Digital IMAX, a lower-cost system that uses two 2K digital projectors to project on a 1.89:1 aspect ratio screen. This lower-cost option, which allowed for the conversion of existing [[multiplex theater]] auditoriums, helped IMAX to grow from 299 screens worldwide at the end of 2007 to over 1,000 screens by the end of 2015.<ref name=results2015 /><ref>{{cite web|title=IMAX Corporation Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007|url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/11/118725/2007_IMAX_Annual_Report.pdf|date=March 14, 2008|accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref>

==Technical aspects==

===Camera===
[[File:IMAX camera 1.jpg|thumb|An IMAX cinema camera, displayed at the National Media Museum, Bradford, U.K.]]

The IMAX cinema process increases the [[image resolution]] by using larger film frame; in relative terms, a frame of IMAX format film has three times the theoretical horizontal resolution of a frame of 35mm film.<ref name="Slash Film">{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/film-interview-imax-executives-talk-the-hunger-games-catching-fire-and-imax-misconceptions/|title=/Film Interview: IMAX Executives Talk 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' and IMAX Misconceptions |publisher=Slash Film|date=December 2, 2013 |accessdate=December 17, 2013}}</ref>

To achieve such increased image resolution, which IMAX estimates at approximately 12 thousand lines of horizontal resolution (12K),<ref name=imaxresolution /> [[65mm film]] stock passes horizontally through the IMAX movie camera, 15 perforations at a time. At 24 frames per second, this means that the film moves through the camera at 102.7 metres per minute (just over 6&nbsp;km/h). In a conventional 65mm camera, the film passes vertically through the camera, five perforations at a time, or 34 metres per minute. In comparison, in a conventional 35mm camera, 35mm film passes vertically through the camera, at four (smaller) perforations at a time, which translates to 27.4 metres per minute.<ref name="Slash Film"/>

In the [[Todd-AO]] 70mm-format of widescreen cinema, the image area of a 65mm film-frame is {{convert|48.5|x|22.1|mm|in|abbr=on}}; in the IMAX-format of widescreen cinema, the movie image is taller than it is wide, given the film-frame dimensions of {{convert|69.6|x|48.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}. To match the standard image resolution of the moving image produced with the film-speed of 24 [[Frame rate|frames per second]], an IMAX film requires three times the length of (negative) film stock required for a 65mm film of comparable scope and [[Cinematography|cinematic technique]].

====3D digital camera====
In 2011, IMAX announced a 4K 3D digital camera with the similar wide resolution of regular IMAX film cameras. The camera was developed alongside Vision Research and AbelCine, integrating two Phantom 65 engines. A prototype camera was used for the documentary ''[[Born to Be Wild (2011 film)|Born to be Wild]]'', in which approximately 10% of the finished film was shot with the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.abelcine.com/2011/05/05/phantom-65-in-the-wild-for-imax-3d-shoot/|title=Phantom 65 used in the "Wild for IMAX 3D shoot|publisher=abelcine.com|date=May 2012|accessdate=}}</ref> It has been said that the company has no intention of replacing the higher resolution film cameras with the new digital camera, but the latter can be used in scenes that require a lightweight or relatively small 3D camera in order to film it without issue. While IMAX has completed the production camera and has been placed into service on several films, there are no plans to produce an IMAX film using solely the new digital system. ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction]]'' is the first feature film to be partially filmed with the Phantom 65 IMAX 3D camera.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvbeurope.com/newsletter-3dmasters-content/full/imax-debuts-digital-3d-camera |title=IMAX debuts digital 3D camera|publisher=tvbeurope.com|date=May 2012|accessdate=}}</ref>

====2D digital camera====
In 2015, IMAX announced a 2D digital camera that was developed alongside [[Arri]], the camera being based on the latter company's [[Arri Alexa| Arri Alexa 65]] technology. The first production to use the camera will be ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''. Directors [[Russo brothers|Joe and Anthony Russo]] have announced that both parts of ''Avengers: Infinity War'' will be filmed completely with IMAX 2D digital cameras.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://variety.com/2015/film/news/captain-america-civil-war-first-to-use-new-imaxarri-2d-camera-exclusive-1201470965/|title='Captain America: Civil War' First to Use New Imax/Arri 2D Camera (Exclusive)|last=Lang|first=Brent|date=April 13, 2015|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=April 13, 2015|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Xlk5Q3S8|archivedate=April 13, 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Film===
The IMAX format is generically called "15/70" film, the name referring to the 15 sprocket holes or perforations per frame. The film's bulk requires horizontal platters, rather than conventional film reels.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brain |first=Marshall |url= http://www.howstuffworks.com/imax.htm/printable |title=Howstuffworks "How IMAX Works" |publisher=Howstuffworks.com |date= | accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> IMAX platters range from {{convert|1.2|to|1.83|m|ft|sp=us}} diameter to accommodate 1 to 2.75 hours of film. Platters with a 2.5 hour feature film weigh {{convert|250|kg|lb}}.

IMAX uses ESTAR-based print film<ref>Kodak's trade name for biaxially oriented PET film</ref> in their 15/70 rolling-loop film projection systems. ESTAR-based print film provides greater precision. The chemical development process does not change the size or shape of ESTAR print film, and IMAX's pin registration system (''especially the camera mechanism'') does not tolerate either [[sprocket]]-hole or film-thickness variations.

===Soundtrack - double-system===
In order to use more of the image area, IMAX film does not include an embedded soundtrack. Instead, the IMAX system specifies a separate six-channel {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} magnetic film, recorded and played back on a [[Sound follower|film follower]] locked to picture, just as [[Vitaphone]] had been (utilizing 16-inch 33 1/3 RPM [[Old-time radio#Electrical transcription discs|electrical transcription discs]]) in the early 20th century, and was the same technology used to provide the 7-channel soundtrack accompanying films photographed and exhibited in the [[Cinerama]] process in the mid-1950s.

By the early 1990s, a separate [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]]-based 6-track digital sound system was used, similarly locked to the projector by a [[SMPTE time code]] synchronization apparatus, the audio played off a series of proprietarily encoded [[CD-ROM]] discs. In the late 1990s this system was upgraded to one using a [[hard disk drive|hard drive]] which carries a single uncompressed [[Audio file format|audio]] file containing the 6 channels. These are then converted directly to analogue rather than using a decoding method such as [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]].

Like conventional theatres, IMAX theatres place speakers both directly behind the acoustically transparent screen and around the theatre to create a "surround sound" effect. IMAX also provides a "top center" speaker in addition to the centre speaker found in conventional theatres. This extra channel allows the sound mix engineers to take advantage of the screen's greater height.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_big_enough_everest/ |title=Big Enough for Everest: Inside IMAX Sound |publisher=DigitalContentProducer.com | date=June 1, 1999 |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref>

===Projectors===
[[File:Xenon IMAX 1.jpg|thumb|The 15 kW [[Xenon arc lamp|Xenon short-arc lamp]] used in IMAX projectors.]]
Drawing the large film through the projector presented challenges for both the camera and the projector. Conventional [[70&nbsp;mm film|70&nbsp;mm]] systems were not steady enough for the 586× magnification. On the projector side, William Shaw adapted an Australian patent for film transport called the "rolling loop" by adding a [[compressed air]] "puffer" to accelerate the film, and put a [[cylindrical lens]] in the projector's "aperture block". The projector uses a [[vacuum]] to pull the film into contact with this lens. Thus the "[[Field flattener lens|field flattener]]" flattens the image field. The lens is twice the height of the film and connects to a [[pneumatic]] [[piston]] so it can be moved up or down while the projector is running. This way, if a piece of dust comes off the film and sticks to the lens, the projectionist can switch to the clean side of the lens at the push of a button. The lens also has "wiper bars" made of a [[felt]] or brush-like material which can wipe dust off the lens as it moves up or down. IMAX projectors are [[pin]] stabilized, meaning four registration pins engage the [[perforation]]s at the corners of the projected frame to ensure perfect alignment. Shaw added [[cam]]-controlled arms to decelerate each frame to eliminate the microscopic shaking as the frame "settled" onto the registration pins. The projector's [[Movie projector#Shutter|shutter]] is open around 20% longer than in conventional equipment and the light source is brighter. The [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon short-arc lamps]] are made of a thin layer of [[fused quartz]] and contain [[xenon]] gas at a pressure of about 25 [[atmosphere (pressure)|atmospheres]] (367 PSI); because of this, projectionists are required to wear protective [[Bulletproof vest|body armor]] when changing or handling these in case the lamp breaks (e.g., due to a drop to the floor) because of the danger from flying [[quartz]] shards when propelled by the high pressure of the xenon gas within.
An IMAX projector weighs up to 1.8 tonne (2 [[short tons]]) and is over {{convert|178|cm|ft|1|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|195|cm|ft|1|abbr=on}} long.

IMAX Corporation has released four projector types that use its 15-perforation, [[70&nbsp;mm film]] format: '''GT''' (Grand Theatre), '''GT 3D''' (dual rotor), '''SR''' (Small Rotor), and '''MPX''', which was designed for retrofitted theatres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/images/corporate/pdfs/filmmaker.pdf|title= The 15/70 Filmmaker's Manual| accessdate =December 29, 2009| publisher =Imax | format = PDF}}</ref> In July 2008, the company introduced a digital projection system, which it has not given a distinct name or brand, designed for multiplex theatres with screens no wider than {{convert|21.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. All IMAX projectors, except the standard GT system, can project [[Stereoscopy|3D images]].

====Digital IMAX projection====
The Digital IMAX projection system, debuted in 2008, is designed to be used with shorter 1.89:1 aspect ratio screens. The system uses two 2K projectors that can present either 2D or 3D content in [[Digital Cinema Initiatives|DCI]] or IMAX Digital Format (IDF) (which in itself is a superset of DCI). IDF initially used 2K-resolution [[Christie (company)|Christie]] xenon projectors, with a [[Texas Instruments]] [[Digital Light Processing]] (DLP) engine, but in 2012 IMAX announced that they would be switching to [[Barco (manufacturer)|Barco]] as their primary supplier.<ref name=barco>{{cite web |url=http://3droundabout.com/2012/02/6178/imax-corporation-selects-barco-as-exclusive-worldwide-projection-technology-partner-for-imax-theatres.html |title=IMAX Corporation Selects Barco as Exclusive, Worldwide Projection Technology Partner for IMAX Theatres|publisher=3droundabout.com |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> The two 2K images are projected superimposed on each other with a half-pixel offset, using [[super-resolution imaging]] to increase the perceived resolution to approximately 2.9K. For 3D presentations, one projector is used to display the image for each eye, while 2D presentations use the superimposed images to allow for a brighter 22-[[foot lambert]] image. The Digital IMAX projection system includes a proprietary IMAX Image Enhancer that modifies the output of the digital media server based on feedback from cameras and microphones in the auditorium, and maintains alignment with sub-pixel accuracy.<ref name="IMAX Digital - Slater">{{cite news|last1=Slater|first1=Jim|title=IMAX Digital: It's IMAX, but not as we know it, Jim!|url=https://www.bksts.com/secure/media/26562935.pdf|work=Cinema Technology|date=December 2008|pages=38–41}}</ref>

Mainly because the system facilitates inexpensive distribution of IMAX features, the company announced in February 2012 that they were re-renovating specially selected locations around the world to present both 70mm analog as well as digital presentations. To do so, IMAX developed a rail system that allows the projectors to be moved in and out if there is either a full-frame film print available or a digital-only release. These theaters were prepared in time for the release of ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'' in July 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/content_display/news-and-features/features/cinemas/e3ib2de80c71a03c7800389970b540cb2de |title=IMAXimum impact: Studio movies go big with large-format leader|publisher=filmjournal.com|date=May 2012|accessdate=}}</ref>

====IMAX with Laser projection====
{{anchor|Laser projection}}In April 2012, IMAX began testing a new 4K laser projection system, based on patents licensed from [[Eastman Kodak]]. Like the 3D film and digital systems, it used two projectors, but it improved over the smaller digital screens by retaining the traditional IMAX aspect ratio and to allowed films to be shown on screens {{convert|36|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide or more.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-25/imax-tests-laser-projector-built-with-kodak-patents.html |title=Imax Tests Laser Projector Built With Kodak Patents |publisher=bloomberg.com|date=May 2012|accessdate=|first=Anthony|last=Palazzo}}</ref>

In December 2014, IMAX began rolling out its new Dual 4K [[laser projector]] system, dubbed "IMAX with Laser", with the first installation occurring at the [[Scotiabank Theatre Toronto|Cineplex ScotiaBank Theatre]] in [[Toronto]].<ref name=latimeslaser>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-imax-laser-20150415-story.html|title=Imax premieres new laser system at TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood|first=Richard|last=Verrier|date=April 15, 2015|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|title=IMAX with Laser is here|url=http://www.imax.com/news/imax-laser-here|website=IMAX|accessdate=March 7, 2016|date=April 1, 2015}}</ref> The system allows digital projection on the full 1.43:1 aspect ratio surface of a traditional IMAX screen, but can also be used on wider screens such as the 2.00:1-aspect-ratio [[TCL Chinese Theater]]. The system replaces the [[xenon arc lamp]] of a traditional digital projector with a laser light source, and is capable of [[High frame rate|60 fps]] with "50 percent greater" brightness than the [[Digital Cinema Initiatives]] spec, a contrast ratio "double" that of IMAX 15/70mm film projection and "higher" than the 2500:1 contrast ratio of IMAX's xenon lamp-based projection systems, and displaying the full [[Rec. 2020]] color gamut/space. The system also features a new [[Surround sound#11.1 surround sound|12-channel]] surround sound system, which adds an additional speaker on either side of the theater as well as four new overhead speakers.<ref name="deadline">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/04/imax-with-laser-projectors-chinese-theater-richard-gelfond-1201410901/ |title=IMAX Shows Off Its First U.S. Laser-Projection System |accessdate=December 18, 2015}}</ref><ref name="arstech">{{cite web|last1=Anthony|first1=Sebastian|url=http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/imax-with-laser-superb-contrast-4k-resolution-and-huge-colour-gamuts/|title=IMAX with laser: Superb contrast, 4K resolution, and huge color gamuts |accessdate=December 18, 2015}}</ref>

While still not matching the theoretical resolution of traditional IMAX film, which is estimated to be up to 12 thousand lines of horizontal resolution on the camera negative (12K) and approximately half that on a release print (6K),<ref name=imaxresolution>{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5250780/how-regular-movies-become-imax-films|title=How Regular Movies Become "IMAX" Films|first=Mark|last=Wilson|date=29 May 2009|work=Gizmodo|publisher=Gawker Media|accessdate=7 March 2016}}</ref> the new laser system features dual-[[4K resolution]] projectors, each capable of displaying four times the detail of one Digital IMAX projector.

===Theatre===
{{see also|List of IMAX venues}}
IMAX theatres are described as either "Classic Design" (purpose-built structures), or "Multiplex Design" (retrofitted auditoriums).<ref name="IMAX">{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/ |title=Imax |date= |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref>  Classic IMAX theatre construction differs significantly from conventional theatres. The increased resolution allows the audience to be much closer to the screen; typically all rows are within one screen height; conventional theatre seating runs 8 to 12-screen heights. Also, the rows of seats are set at a steep angle (up to 30° in some domed theatres) so that the audience is facing the screen directly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatscience.com/visit/omnihome.php |title=The Omnimax Theatre | publisher = Great Lakes Science Center |date=June 27, 1996 |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref>

A standard IMAX screen is {{convert|22|x|16.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but can be significantly larger.

==IMAX variations==

===IMAX Dome / OMNIMAX===
[[File:Cecut.jpg|thumb|Outside of the IMAX dome in [[Tijuana]], Baja California, México]]
[[File:OMNIMAX frame (English).svg|thumb|The frame layout of the IMAX Dome film]]
[[File:IMAX Dome control room.jpg|thumb|The control room of an IMAX Dome Theatre]]
[[File:Vista lateral museo Alfa.jpg|thumb|[[Alfa Planetarium|Planetario Alfa]], museum, astronomical observatory and IMAX Dome system, [[Monterrey]], NL, Mexico.]]
In the late 1960s the San Diego Hall of Science (now known as the [[Reuben H. Fleet Science Center]]) began searching North America for a large-format film system to project on the dome of their planned {{convert|23.16|m|ft|abbr=on}} tilted [[dome]] [[planetarium]]. The standard IMAX projector was unsuitable for use inside a dome because it had a {{convert|3.65|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall lamp house on top. IMAX Corporation redesigned its system, adding an [[elevator]] to lift the projector to the center of the dome from the projection booth below. Spectra Physics designed a suitable lamphouse that took smaller, {{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} lamps and placed the bulb behind the lens instead of above the projector. In 1970,<ref>[http://www.elcan.com/About_ELCAN/History/ Elcan.com] {{wayback|url=http://www.elcan.com/About_ELCAN/History/ |date=20100317234532 }}</ref> Ernst Leitz Canada, Ltd. (now [[ELCAN Optical Technologies]]) won a contract to develop and manufacture a [[fisheye lens]] projection system optimized to project an image onto a dome instead of a flat screen.

The dome system, which the San Diego Hall of Science called OMNIMAX, uses films shot with a camera equipped with a fisheye lens that squeezes a highly distorted 180° field of view onto the 65&nbsp;mm IMAX film. The lens is aligned below the center of the frame and most of the bottom half of the circular field falls beyond the edge of the film. The part of the field that would fall below the edge of the dome is masked. When filming, the camera is aimed upward at an angle that matches the tilt of the dome. When projected through a matching fisheye lens onto a dome, the original panoramic view is recreated. OMNIMAX wraps 180° horizontally, 100° above the horizon and 22° below the horizon for a viewer at the center of the dome. OMNIMAX premiered in 1973 showing ''[[Voyage to the Outer Planets]]'' (produced by Graphic Films) and ''[[Garden Isle]]'' (by Roger Tilton Films) on a double bill.

IMAX has since renamed the system IMAX Dome. However, some theatres continue to call it OMNIMAX.

OMNIMAX theatres inhabit theme parks and North American museums, particularly those with a scientific focus, where the technical aspects of the system may be highlighted as part of the attraction. The projection room is often windowed to allow public viewing and accompanied by informational placards like other exhibits. The screen may be a permanent fixture, such as at the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Chicago, Illinois; [[Carnegie Science Center]] in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; the [[Franklin Institute]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; the [[St. Louis Science Center]]; [[Museum of Science (Boston)|Boston's Museum of Science]]; [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond's]] [[Science Museum of Virginia]]; Birmingham, Alabama's McWane Science Center and [[US Space and Rocket Center]] in Huntsville, AL; the [[Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal]] and [[Great Lakes Science Center]] in Cleveland, OH; or lowered and raised as needed, such as at the [[Canadian Museum of History]] (where it shares an auditorium with a standard IMAX screen). The entire dome can be raised to show flat screen features and lowered for dome features. For the flat screen theaters, before the feature begins, the screen can be backlit to show the speakers and girders behind it. While the majority of museum installations focus on educational and documentary films, on special occasions, entertainment films are also shown, such as [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]] at the [[Oregon Museum of Science and Industry]]. The largest in North America are at [[Liberty Science Center]] in [[Jersey City]], New Jersey and the [[Science World (Vancouver)|Telus World of Science]] in Vancouver, BC, both of which have dome screens {{convert|27|m|ft}} in size.

===IMAX 3D===
{{Further2|[[3D film]]}}
To create the illusion of depth, the IMAX [[Stereoscopy|3D]] process uses two separate camera lenses that represent the left and right eyes. The lenses are separated by a distance of {{convert|64|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the average distance between a human's eyes. Two separate rolls of film are used to capture the images they produce. The IMAX 3D camera weighs over {{convert|113|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

By projecting the two films superimposed on the screen and using one of several available methods to direct only the correct image to each eye, viewers see a 3D image on a 2D screen.

One method is to use [[polarizer|polarizing filters]] to oppositely [[linear polarization|polarize]] the light used in projecting each image. The viewer wears glasses with polarizing filters oriented to match the projector filters, so that the filter over each eye blocks the light used to project the images intended for the other eye.

In another method, the two projections rapidly alternate. While one image is being shown, the projection of its mate is blocked. Each [[film frame|frame]] is shown more than once to increase the rate and suppress flicker. The viewer wears [[Active shutter 3D system|shutter glasses]] with [[liquid crystal display|liquid crystal]]<!-- unfortunately, the "liquid crystal" article is dauntingly technical --> shutters that block or transmit light [[synchronization|in sync]] with the projectors, so each eye sees only the images meant for it.

Several of the early films that had been produced in [[digital 3D]] for release in conventional theaters<!-- the AE spelling appears to predominate in this article --> were also presented in IMAX 3D, including ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[Gravity (film)|Gravity]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. The first full-color IMAX 3D film was the 1986 short documentary ''[[Transitions (film)|Transitions]]'', produced for [[Expo 86]] in Vancouver.<ref name="Aitken">{{cite book|last=Aitken|first=Ian|title=Encyclopedia of the Documentary Film|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=JdSNAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA169&dq=%22Encyclopedia+of+the+Documentary+Film%22+IMAX&hl=en&sa=X&ei=a8-CVYS9Icbm-AHTqIDYCw&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Encyclopedia%20of%20the%20Documentary%20Film%22%20IMAX&f=false|date=October 27, 2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1579584450|pages=168–9}}</ref>

===IMAX HD===
Variations on IMAX included the [[High Frame Rate|48 frames per second]] IMAX HD process, which sought to produce smoother, more lifelike motion, while also reducing the blurring of moving objects, by doubling the normal film rate. The IMAX HD system was tested in 1992 at the Canada Pavilion of the [[Seville Expo '92]] with the film ''[[Momentum (IMAX film)|Momentum]]''.<ref name="NFB Seville">{{cite web | url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2010/07/23/the-nfb-and-world-fairs-pt-4-seville-and-expo-92/ | title=The NFB and World Fairs, pt. 4: Seville and Expo 92 | publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]] | work=NFB.ca Blog | date=July 23, 2010 | accessdate=June 12, 2012 | author=St-Pierre, Marc}}</ref> Higher production costs, and the high "wear-and-tear" on the prints and projectors, doomed the IMAX HD system, but, not before many theatres had been retrofitted to project at 48 frames, especially in Canada, in order to play ''Momentum''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.stateuniversity.com/pages/10484/IMAX.html |title=IMAX – Precursors, Technical aspects, IMAX Dome/OMNIMAX, IMAX 3D, Viewer experience, History, Content, Technical specifications |publisher=Encyclopedia.stateuniversity.com |date= |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> In the 1990s theme parks in Thailand, Germany, and Las Vegas used IMAX HD for their Motion Simulator rides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Imax-Corporation-Company-History.html |title=IMAX Corporation – Company History |publisher=Fundinguniverse.com |date= |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> The Disney parks attraction [[Soarin' Over California]] features a modification of both IMAX HD and IMAX Dome, projecting in 48 frames per second.

===Digital IMAX===
Because 70mm film and projectors are costly and difficult to mass produce, and because the size of auditoriums that house full-size IMAX screens make them expensive to construct, IMAX debuted a digital projection system in 2008 designed to be used with shorter 1.89:1 aspect ratio screens. It uses two 2K-resolution projectors that can present either 2D or 3D content in [[Digital Cinema Initiatives|DCI]] or IMAX Digital Format (IDF) (which in itself is a superset of DCI). The digital installations have caused some controversy, as many theaters have branded their screens as IMAX after merely retrofitting standard auditoriums with IMAX digital projectors. The screen sizes in these auditoriums are much smaller than those in the purpose-built auditoriums of the original 15/70 IMAX format, and are limited to the 1.89:1 aspect ratio.

Another disadvantage is the much lower resolution of digital IMAX. The technology has a maximum perceived resolution of 2.9K, compared to traditional IMAX 70mm projection, which has an estimated resolution of 12K.<ref name="imaxresolution" /><ref name="IMAX Digital - Slater" /><ref name=atlasomega>{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasomega.com/2010/08/howard-hall-interview/|title=Interview with Underwater Filmmaker Howard Hall|first=Calvin|last=Tang|work=AtlasOmega|publisher=AtlasOmega Media, LLC|date=15 August 2010|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref> Some reviewers have also noted that many non-IMAX theaters are projecting films at [[4K resolution]] through competing brands such as [[Dolby Cinema]] and [[Cineplex Entertainment#Premium screens|UltraAVX]].

IMAX has held to a uniform branding of "The IMAX Experience" across various underlying technologies and screen sizes.<ref name="lfexaminer.com">Hyder, James (October 16, 2008).

In May 2016, IMAX announced the test launch of IMAXShift, a multimedia [[Indoor cycling]] concept.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/will-imax-shift-change-the-cycling-landscape-150940354.html |title=New Imax Shift |last=Pogue |first=David |date=May 18, 2016 |website=[[YahooTech]] |access-date=May 18, 2016}}</ref>

===Entertainment films===
[[File:Viewing 3D IMAX clips.jpg|thumb|left|Audiences view a film using 3D glasses.]]
IMAX in the USA has mostly been used for specialty applications. The expense and logistical challenges of producing and presenting IMAX films have led to approximately 40 minute shorter running times than conventional films. Most are documentaries suited for institutional venues such as museums and science centers. IMAX cameras have been used while orbiting the earth, climbing [[Mount Everest]], exploring the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, and visiting the [[Antarctic]]. A film about the [[Mars Exploration Rovers]], titled ''[[Roving Mars]]'' (2006), used exclusive data{{clarify|date=December 2015}} from the rovers.<ref name="IMAX"/>

An early attempt at presenting mainstream entertainment in IMAX was ''[[Stones at the Max|The Rolling Stones: Live at the Max]]'' (1991), an 85-minute compilation of concert footage filmed in IMAX during the band's [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour|1990 Steel Wheels tour]], edited to give the impression of a single concert.

In the 1990s more entertainment short films were created, notably ''[[T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous]]'' in 1998 and ''[[Haunted Castle (2001 film)|Haunted Castle]]'' in 2001 (both in 3D). In 1995, French director [[Jean-Jacques Annaud]] directed ''[[Wings of Courage]]'', the first dramatic picture shot for IMAX. In 1998 and 1999, ''[[More (1998 film)|More]]'' and ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1999 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]'' became the first short films produced using the IMAX format and both earned Academy Award nominations, with ''Old Man and the Sea'' winning (the only IMAX film to win an Oscar). In 2000, [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] produced ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', the first full-length animated feature initially released exclusively in the IMAX format.

===Use in Hollywood productions===
Before the end of the 1990s, theatrical features were deemed impossible to run in the IMAX venues at the time, as there was a technical limitation on the size of the film reel where films had to be run around two hours. Originally IMAX and [[Pixar]] were considering to release ''[[Toy Story]]'' in IMAX 3D, but the results of the tests displayed that the render resolution could not match to the size of the IMAX image.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imax.com/community/blog/close-call/ |title=BLOG @ IMAX: Close Call |publisher=Imax.com |date=June 18, 2012 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> [[DreamWorks]] in the early 2000s wanted to re-release ''[[Shrek]]'' in IMAX 3D, but this too was canceled as a result of creative changes in the studio.<ref>{{cite web|author=Studio Briefing |url=http://culture.com/news/item/1423/as-expected-imax-reports-a-loss.phtml |title=As Expected, IMAX Reports A Loss |publisher=Culture.com |date=November 9, 2009 |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}</ref> These failed attempts at re-releases did inspire IMAX to experiment and improve their ability in presenting computer-animation in their theaters. Their compilation ''[[CyberWorld]]'' was the result, which contained new original animation and IMAX-presented versions of computer animated tests and music videos. ''Cyberworld'' even presented [[open matte|open-matte]] 3D versions of the bar sequence from ''[[Antz]]'' and the "[[Treehouse of Horror VI|Homer3]]" segment from ''[[The Simpsons]]'', both coincidentally were animated at [[Pacific Data Images]].

[[Walt Disney Pictures]] became the first studio to release theatrical films in the IMAX process. Released on New Year's Day in 2000, ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'' was the studio's first IMAX release and the first theatrical feature to be presented in IMAX theaters. It was originally planned as a standard theatrical release, but in agreeing with the company to release the film, the IMAX sound system incorporated a multi-channel and multi-layer stereo system for the orchestrated soundtrack, similar to the [[Fantasound]] system Walt Disney used for the original film decades ago. The company agreed to Disney's terms and conditions to gain the exclusive first showings of the film. These included a limited engagement of 4 months (from January 1 to April 30) and 50% of the box office receipts. Not all IMAX cinemas were prepared to accept Disney's terms to present the film; however, following the IMAX release, a standard 35mm run followed in June at regular theatres.

Although ''Fantasia 2000'' had a luke-warm financial run, the critical praise for its use of the IMAX format convinced Disney to put more releases in the giant-screen format in the pipeline. In 2002, IMAX re-issues of ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Lion King]]'' were released in select theaters over the winter and Christmas seasons of that year. New [[digital master]]s were created from the original [[Computer Animation Production System|CAPS]] production files and select scenes of animation were cleaned up to make use of the high resolution IMAX film negatives. ''[[Treasure Planet]]'' was also released in select IMAX theaters and was the first theatrical film to be released in regular and IMAX theaters simultaneously. But all of these releases had underwhelming box office returns and Disney canceled later big-screen re-releases, including ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]''.

With the unveiling of the DMR process (see below), [[Warner Brothers|Warner Bros. Pictures]] especially embraced the format beginning in 2003 with the two ''[[The Matrix|Matrix]]'' sequels, ''[[The Matrix Reloaded|Reloaded]]'' and ''[[The Matrix Revolutions|Revolutions]]''. Since ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|The Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004, Warner Bros. began releasing [[Harry Potter (film series)|the Harry Potter film franchise]] in IMAX to strong financial success. Also in 2004 the studio released [[Robert Zemeckis]]' motion-capture film ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' in IMAX 3D. ''Polar Express'' became the most successful film to be released in IMAX theatres, producing at least a quarter of the film's gross of $302 million from fewer than 100 IMAX screens.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Success for Warner Bros. and IMAX followed in later years with ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'', ''[[Happy Feet]]'', ''[[Batman Begins]]'' and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. Progressively other studios became further interested in releasing films in IMAX through the DMR process and have earned success through it. In 2009, [[J. J. Abrams]]'s ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' was released for initially two weeks in IMAX venues in May and opened to $8.3 million dollars.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003418.html?categoryid=13&cs=1 |title=Star Trek' beams up $76.5 million |first=Pamela |last=McClintock |work=Variety |date=May 10, 2009}}</ref> The IMAX opening weekends of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2]]'' have since grossed $15 million.

Though they weren't filmed with IMAX cameras, ''[[Skyfall]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' were optimized for IMAX digital screens when they were released. Both movies were filmed in high-resolution cameras and the digital negative ratio was equal to that of the IMAX Digital frame. ''Skyfall'' increased the visual information of the entire film while ''Amazing Spider-Man'' optimized the finale battle with the Lizard. [[James Cameron]]'s ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' when it was restored and re-released in theaters also specially made an open-matte version for IMAX. In 2010 after years of successful IMAX DMR releases, Warner Bros. signed a deal to release up to 20 feature films in IMAX up to 2013, including educational documentaries that were in production.<ref>{{cite web|author=QMI Agency |url=http://www.torontosun.com/money/2010/04/28/13751681.html |title=IMAX inks 20-film deal with Warner Bros. |work=Toronto Sun |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=May 23, 2012}}</ref>

In May 2015, it was announced that [[Marvel Studios]]'s two-part film, ''Avengers: Infinity War'', will be filmed entirely in IMAX, the first Hollywood feature film to do so, using a modified version of [[Arri]]'s Alexa 65 digital camera. The camera is set to be used first to film select sequences in another Marvel production, 2016's ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vlessing|first1=Etan|title=Marvel's 'Avengers: Infinity War' to be Shot Entirely With Imax/Arri 2D Camera|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marvels-avengers-infinity-war-be-794031|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=‘Captain America: Civil War’ First to Use IMAX/Arri 2D Camera|url=http://www.imax.com/news/captain-america-civil-war-first-use-new-imaxarri-2d-camera-exclusive|website=IMAX|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Marvel's 'Avengers: Infinity War' To Be Filmed Using The IMAX/Arri Digital Camera|url=http://marvel.com/news/movies/24583/marvels_avengers_infinity_war_to_be_filmed_using_the_imaxarri_digital_camera|website=Marvel|accessdate=29 April 2016}}</ref>

===IMAX DMR (Digital Media Remastering)===
{{see also|List of IMAX DMR films}}
IMAX's proprietary DMR (Digital Media Remastering) process allows conventional films to be [[Video scaler|upconverted]] into IMAX format. This special [[digital intermediate]] technology allowed films shot on 35mm for conventional theatres to be shown in IMAX venues. In 2002, ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones]]'' and an IMAX-format re-release of the 1995 film ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', were the first official applications of the DMR process. Because of the projection limitations at the time, ''Apollo 13'' and ''Attack of the Clones'' had to be edited down from their original length. As IMAX updated the system and expanded the size of the platters, the later DMR releases did not have this limitation; current platters allow a run time of up to 175 minutes.

Reviewers have generally praised the results of the DMR blowup process, which are visually and audibly superior to the same films projected in 35mm.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} But some filmmakers, such as producer [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], point out that DMR blowups are not comparable to films created directly in the 70&nbsp;mm 15 perf IMAX format, and that directors [[Ron Howard]] and [[George Lucas]] expected better.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in70mm.com/news/2004/lfca/index.htm |title=Change Comes To LFCA. 2004 LFCA |publisher=In70mm.com |date= |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}</ref> They note that the decline of [[Cinerama]] coincided roughly with its replacement by a simpler, cheaper, technically inferior version, and view DMR with alarm. IMAX originally reserved the phrase "the IMAX experience" for true 70&nbsp;mm productions, but now allows its use on DMR productions as well.

After ''The Lion King'' in 2003, no Hollywood studio engaged in re-releasing and restoring classic films through the IMAX DMR process until 2012 although ongoing conversion of new releases continued and continued to grow in number. James Cameron's ''Titanic'' underwent both 3D conversion and DMR conversion to 3D in 2012 as did ''Men in Black 3''. In August 2012 IMAX and [[Paramount Pictures]] announced a one-week exclusive re-release of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' on September 7, 2012, to promote the release of the Blu-Ray collection. The film, before it underwent DMR, was already restored in a 4K digital intermediate with 7.1 surround sound from the original negative. The process for IMAX theaters, like with the complete restoration, was supervised by [[Steven Spielberg]] and sound designer [[Ben Burtt]]. "I didn't know if the 1981 print would stand up to a full IMAX transfer, so I came expecting a sort of grainy, muddy, and overly enlarged representation of the movie I had made years ago," Spielberg said. "I was blown away by the fact that it looked better than the movie I had made years ago." For other DMR releases and re-releases see [[List of IMAX DMR films]].

===Feature films partially shot on IMAX cameras===
Some recent features have employed IMAX cameras for select scenes, however no full-length feature film has yet been shot entirely using IMAX cameras due to the numerous difficulties presented with the format – the cameras are much larger and heavier than standard cameras and as they are noisier it makes dialogue recording difficult.<ref name="Slash">{{cite web|title=How The Dark Knight Went IMAX|publisher=Slash Film|date=June 14, 2008 | url = http://www.slashfilm.com/how-the-dark-knight-went-imax/| accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref>  The cameras have short film loads ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes<ref name="Slash"/> and the cost of the film stock is much greater than standard 35mm film.<ref name="Wrap">{{cite web|title=3D a 'Flash in the Pan' – 'Inception' Cinematographer|publisher=The Wrap|date=November 12, 2010 | url = http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/inception-cinematographer-3-d-may-be-flash-pan-22480| accessdate=January 23, 2011}}</ref>

''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' features six sequences (a total of 28 minutes) shot using IMAX. According to the film's press notes, this was the "first time ever that a major feature film has been even partially shot using IMAX cameras".<ref>Warner Bros. Pictures press notes, ''The Dark Knight''</ref> Even before ''Dark Knight'', Nolan had wanted to shoot a film in the IMAX format, and he also used it for quiet scenes which pictorially he thought would be interesting. Nolan said that he wished that it were possible to shoot the entire film in IMAX: "if you could take an IMAX camera to Mount Everest or outer space, you could use it in a feature movie." In addition, Nolan chose to edit some of the IMAX sequences using the original camera negative, which by eliminating generation loss, raised the film resolution of those sequences up to 18 thousand lines. When the film opened in 94 IMAX venues in 2008, all of them were sold out for the opening weekend.

A year later, director [[Michael Bay]] was inspired by IMAX's use in ''The Dark Knight'' to feature big-screen sequences in ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive Video: Director Michael Bay talks Transformers Revenge of the Fallen|publisher=Collider|date=February 9, 2009 | url = http://www.collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/10866/tcid/1 | accessdate=April 16, 2010}}</ref> The film's co-writer Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be 3D, but Bay later said that considering himself an "old school" filmmaker, he found 3D gimmicky and added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras. The IMAX version of the film, in the end, contained almost ten minutes of IMAX-filmed footage out of the two and a half hour film. Bay later partially filmed the third Transformers film, ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|Dark of the Moon]]'' in 3D but without IMAX. Bay returned to IMAX for the fourth film, ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction|Age of Extinction]]'', in 2014. It was the first feature film to be shot using digital IMAX 3D cameras.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/transformers-4-imax-digital-camera-michael-bay/|title=Exclusive: Michael Bay Reveals TRANSFORMERS 4 Will Shoot the 'Showcase Scenes' With the New IMAX 3D Digital Camera |publisher=Collider.com |date=April 15, 2013 |accessdate=April 17, 2013}}</ref>

Two years later, [[Brad Bird]]'s ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'' had 25 minutes of footage shot using IMAX cameras.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paramount Pictures and IMAX Pact for Four Films in 2011|publisher=Giant Screen Cinema Association|date=January 10, 2011 | url = http://www.giantscreencinema.com/Newsroom/News/tabid/70/ctl/ViewItem/mid/528/ItemId/1007/Default.aspx?SkinSrc=/Portals/_default/Skins/NewSkinner/News&ContainerSrc=/Portals/_default/Containers/NewSkinner/Basic | accessdate=January 18, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Mission Impossible' To Open Early On IMAX|publisher=[[Paramount Pictures]] [[press release]] via [[Deadline.com]]|date=October 5, 2011| url = http://www.deadline.com/2011/10/mission-impossible-to-open-early-on-imax/ | accessdate=October 27, 2011}}</ref> Bird believed that using IMAX format would bring back "a level of showmanship" to the presentation of Hollywood films, which he believes the industry has lost due to its emphasis on screening films in [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplexes]] as opposed to grand theaters, and vetoing "first runs" in favor of wider initial releases.<ref>{{cite news|title=Brad Bird: 'Mission: Impossible' opening early at IMAX|publisher= Indiewire|date= September 28, 2011 | url = http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/09/28/brad-bird-were-opening-mission-impossible-early-at-imax/| accessdate=October 27, 2011}}</ref> He also added that the IMAX format offered the viewer more immersion than digital 3D due to its brighter, higher quality image, which is projected on a larger screen, without the need for specialised glasses. ''Ghost Protocol'' opened on December 16, 2011, in almost 500 IMAX venues worldwide a week before its wide release where it earned third place in the box office and $12 million dollars.

Like with ''The Dark Knight'', [[Christopher Nolan]] decided to film sequences of the sequel, ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', in 15/70mm IMAX.<ref>{{cite web|title=VP of IMAX talks 'The Dark Knight Rises'|publisher=Batman-News.com|date=October 27, 2010 | url = http://batman-news.com/2010/12/22/vp-of-imax-talks-the-dark-knight-rises/ | accessdate=December 28, 2010}}</ref> Nolan elected not to film in 3D and stated that he intends to focus on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format. In a Hollywood record, ''The Dark Knight Rises'' featured 72 minutes of footage shot in IMAX (in comparison, ''The Dark Knight'' contained 28 minutes.) But because of the considerable noise made by IMAX cameras, 35mm and 70mm cameras had to be used for shooting the film's dialogue scenes, and dialogue had to be dubbed when shot with IMAX cameras. Chairman and president of the IMAX Corporation Greg Foster stated that IMAX plans to run the film in its theaters for two months, despite only being contractually committed to run the film for two weeks in some theaters.
