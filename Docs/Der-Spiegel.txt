'''''Der Spiegel''''' ({{IPA-de|deːɐ ˈʃpiːɡəl}}, lit. ''"The Mirror"'') is a [[Germany|German]] weekly [[news magazine]] published in [[Hamburg]]. It is one of Europe's largest publications of its kind, with a weekly circulation of 840,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://german.about.com/od/newsnachrichten/a/englSpiegel.htm|title= DER SPIEGEL is Germany's oldest news magazine, founded in 1946 as an obvious imitation of America's TIME and NEWSWEEK magazines|accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/04/19/spiegel_ed3_.php|title=Scoop on Bundesbank head returns focus to Der Spiegel|accessdate =2 January 2008|author=Kevin J.

Typically, the magazine has a content to advertising ratio of 2:1.

''Der Spiegel'' is known in [[German language|German-speaking]] countries mostly for its [[investigative journalism]]. It has played a key role in uncovering many political scandals such as the [[Spiegel scandal]] in 1962 and the [[Flick affair]] in the 1980s. According to ''[[The Economist]]'', ''Der Spiegel'' is one of [[continental Europe]]'s most influential magazines.<ref>{{cite news|title=Der Spiegel and Germany's press: His country's mirror|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1446317|work=The Economist|accessdate=30 June 2013|quote=Mr Augstein's success in making Der Spiegel one of continental Europe's most influential magazines...|date=16 November 2002}}</ref>

[[Image:2013-06-08_Highflyer_HP_L4711.JPG|thumb|left|upright|New Spiegel headquarters since 2011, [[Hamburg]]]]
The first edition of ''Der Spiegel'' was published in [[Hanover]] on Saturday, 4 January 1947.<ref name=sixds>{{cite news|title=Six Decades of Quality Journalism: The History of DER SPIEGEL|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/six-decades-of-quality-journalism-the-history-of-der-spiegel-a-789853.html|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=Der Spiegel|date=5 October 2011}}</ref> Its release was initiated and sponsored by the British occupational administration and preceded by a magazine titled, ''Diese Woche'' (meaning ''This Week'' in English),<ref name=sixds/> which had first been published in November 1946. After disagreements with the British, the magazine was handed over to [[Rudolf Augstein]] as chief editor, and was renamed ''Der Spiegel''. From the first edition in January 1947, Augstein held the position of editor-in-chief, which he retained until his death on 7 November 2002.

After 1950, the magazine was owned by Rudolf Augstein and John Jahr; Jahr's share merged with [[Richard Gruner]] in 1965 to form the publishing company [[Gruner + Jahr]]. In 1969, Augstein bought out Gruner + Jahr for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 42&nbsp;million and became the sole owner of ''Der Spiegel''. In 1971, Gruner + Jahr bought back a 25% share in the magazine. In 1974, Augstein restructured the company to make the employees shareholders. All employees with more than three years seniority were offered the opportunity to become an associate and participate in the management of the company, as well as in the profits.

Since 1952, ''Der Spiegel'' has been headquartered in its own building in the old town part of Hamburg.

''Der Spiegel'''s circulation rose quickly. From 15,000 copies in 1947, it grew to 65,000 in 1948 and 437,000 in 1961. It was nearly 500,000 copies in 1962.<ref name=ser>{{cite journal|author1=Frank Esser|author2=Uwe Hartung|title=Nazis, Pollution, and no Sex: Political Scandals as a Reflection of Political Culture in Germany|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2004|volume=47|issue=1040|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/content/47/8/1040|accessdate=4 October 2013|doi=10.1177/0002764203262277|pages=1040–1071}}</ref> By the 1970s, it had reached a plateau at about 900,000 copies. When the [[German re-unification]] in 1990 made it available to a new readership in former [[East Germany]], the circulation exceeded one million.

The magazine's influence is based on two pillars; firstly the [[moral authority]] established by investigative journalism since the early years and proven alive by several impressive scoops during the 1980s; secondly the economic power of the prolific ''Spiegel'' publishing house. Since 1988, it has produced the TV programme ''Spiegel TV'', and further diversified during the 1990s.

During the second quarter of 1992 the circulation of ''Der Spiegel'' was 1.1 million copies.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Georg Hellack|title=Press, Radio and Television in the Federal Republic of Germany|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED353617.pdf|work=Inter Nationes|accessdate=27 April 2015|location=Bonn|format=Report|date=1992}}</ref> In 1994, ''[[Spiegel Online]]'' was launched.<ref name=chi5>{{cite journal|author=Christina Schäffner|title=Bringing a German Voice to English-speaking Readers: Spiegel International|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|year=2005|volume=5|issue=2|pages=154–167|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14708470508668891|accessdate=4 October 2013|doi=10.1080/14708470508668891}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Anne Penketh|author2=Philip Oltermann|author3=Stephen Burgen|title=European newspapers search for ways to survive digital revolution|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/12/european-newspapers-digital-revolution|accessdate=7 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=12 June 2014|location=Paris, Berlin, Barcelona}}</ref> It has separate and independent editorial staff from ''Der Spiegel''.

==Reception==
When [[Stefan Aust]] took over in 1994, the magazine's readers realised that his personality was different from his predecessor. In 2005, a documentary by Stephan Lamby quoted him as follows: "We stand at a very big cannon!"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecomediatv.de/live_2010_1/en/produktionen/item/307-stefan-aust-der-chef.html|title= "We stand at a very big cannon!" Aust ranks his influence with the Spiegel - and openly acknowledges that he has enemies.|accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref> Politicians of all stripes who had to deal with the magazine's attention often voiced their disaffection for it. The outspoken conservative [[Franz Josef Strauß]] contended that ''Der Spiegel'' was "the [[Gestapo]] of our time". He referred to journalists in general as "rats".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cafebabel.co.uk/article/33404/journalists-politicians-europe-insults-attacks.html |title= Strauss claimed that journalists were like vermin around shit (Ratten und Schmeißfliegen)|accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref> The Social Democrat [[Willy Brandt]] called it "Scheißblatt" (i.e., a "shit paper") during his term in office as [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]].

''Der Spiegel'' often produces feature-length articles on problems affecting Germany (like demographic trends, the federal system's gridlock or the issues of its education system) and describes optional strategies and their risks in depth.<ref>{{Cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/node/1446317|title=The best investigative reporting, the widest foreign coverage, the sharpest political analysis, and the most insightful social commentary|accessdate=9 April 2011|work=The Economist|date=14 November 2002}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/der-spiegel-report-hits-vw-shares-1554394.html|title='Der Spiegel' report hits VW shares|accessdate=9 April 2011|location=London|work=[[The Independent]]|author=Sarah Lambert|date=29 September 1992}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-10/german-euro-insolvency-plan-comes-with-haircut-spiegel-says.html|title=Holders of sovereign bonds, while taking a so-called haircut, would be guaranteed half the bond’s face value as an incentive to take part in debt restructuring, Spiegel said|accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12816068|title=Here's how Spiegel puts it: "Germany is witnessing a stunning political about-face".

==Investigative journalism==
''Der Spiegel'' has a distinctive reputation for revealing political misconduct and scandals. Online Encyclopædia Britannica emphasizes this quality of the magazine as follows: "The magazine is renowned for its aggressive, vigorous, and well-written exposes of government malpractice and scandals."<ref name=chi5/> It merited recognition for this as early as 1950, when the federal parliament launched an inquiry into ''Spiegel''{{-'}}s accusations that bribed members of parliament had promoted [[Bonn]] over [[Frankfurt]] as the seat of West Germany's government.

During the [[Spiegel scandal]] in 1962, which followed the release of a report about the possibly low state of readiness of the [[Bundeswehr|German armed forces]], minister of defence and conservative figurehead [[Franz Josef Strauß]] had ''Der Spiegel'' investigated. In the course of this investigation, the editorial offices were raided by police while Rudolf Augstein and other ''Der Spiegel'' editors were arrested on charges of treason. Despite a lack of sufficient authority, Strauß even went after the article's author, Conrad Ahlers, who was consequently arrested in Spain where he was on holiday. When the legal case collapsed, the scandal led to a major shake-up in chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s cabinet and Strauß had to stand down. The affair was generally received as an attack on the freedom of the press. Since then, ''Der Spiegel'' has repeatedly played a significant role in revealing political grievances and misdeeds, including the [[Flick Affair]].<ref name=ser/>

The Spiegel scandal is now remembered for altering the political culture of post-war Germany and—with the first mass demonstrations and public protests—being a turning point from the old Obrigkeitsstaat ([[authoritarian]] state) to a modern [[democracy]].

In 2010, the magazine supported [[WikiLeaks]] in publishing [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked materials from the United States State Department]], along with ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[El País]]'', and ''[[Le Monde]]''<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,731441,00.html WikiLeaks FAQ: What Do the Diplomatic Cables Really Tell Us?] ''Der Spiegel'', 28 November 2010</ref> and in October 2013 with the help of former [[NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]] unveiled the systematic wiretapping of [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]]'s private cell phone over a period of over 10 years at the hands of the [[National Security Agency]]'s [[Special Collection Service]] (SCS).<ref>[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205.html  Embassy Espionage: The NSA's Secret Spy Hub in Berlin] ''Der Spiegel'', 27 October 2013</ref>

The leading role of the magazine in investigative journalism and its monopoly came to end in 2013 since other German media outlets, including ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Bild]]'', [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]], began to effectively deal with [[political scandals]].<ref name=nyt29/>

===Criticism===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
One of the main points of criticism that has been brought against ''Der Spiegel'' concerns the use of language in the magazine. In 1957, writer [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] published his essay ''Die Sprache des Spiegels'' (“The Language of Der Spiegel”), in which he criticised what he called a "pretended objectivity". Wolf Schneider, an eminent journalist and stylist has called ''Der Spiegel'' "the biggest mangler of the German language" and used quotations from the magazine as examples of inept German in his style guides. Their criticism was not so much one of linguistic [[aesthetics]] as an argument that ''Der Spiegel'' "hides and distorts its actual topics and issues by manipulative semantics and rhetoric rather than by reporting and analysing them". In 1957, however, Enzensberger admitted in a written statement that no other contemporary German magazine attained the ''Spiegel''{{-'}}s level of objectivity.

Opinions about the level of language employed by ''Der Spiegel'' changed in the late 1990s. After hiring many of Germany's best feature writers, ''Der Spiegel'' has become known for its "Edelfedern" ("noble quills"—wordsmiths). The magazine frequently wins the [[Egon Erwin Kisch Prize]] for the best German feature. ''Der Spiegel'' ended up joining the ranks of the guardians of proper grammar and jargon with the ''Zwiebelfisch'' ("(printer's) pie") column on the magazine's website, which has even produced several best-selling books.

Some critics, in particular the media historian [[Lutz Hachmeister]] and the Augstein biographer and former ''Der Spiegel'' author Otto Köhler, have brought charges against the magazine's dealings with former Nazis, even [[SS]] officers. Allegedly, ''Der Spiegel'', which at other times showed no restraint when exposing the Nazi past of public figures, distorted history and covered up for criminals after enlisting insiders hired to write about [[Third Reich]] topics.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Its early reports and serials about the [[Reichstag fire]], written by former SS officers [[Paul Carell]] (who had also served as chief press spokesman for Nazi Germany's Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]) and [[Fritz Tobias]], have since been considered influential in historiography because since the 1960s the ''Spiegel'' reports written by these two authors have been corroborated by authoritative historian [[Hans Mommsen]].

==Bans==
A special 25 March edition of ''Der Spiegel'' on [[Islam]] was banned in [[Egypt]] in April 2008 for publishing material deemed by authorities to be  insulting Islam and [[Prophet Muhammed]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Der Spiegel issue on Islam banned in Egypt|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080402-der-spiegel-issue-islam-banned-egypt-egypt-germany|accessdate=29 September 2013|work=France24|date=2 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Leading German Magazine Banned in Egypt|url=http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/articlesv2.php?id=2081|publisher=The Arab Press Network|accessdate=9 September 2014|date=3 April 2008}}</ref>

==Head office==
''Der Spiegel'' began moving into its current head office, HafenCity, in September 2011. The facility was designed by Henning Larsen Architects of [[Denmark]]. The magazine was previously located in a high-rise building with {{convert|8226|sqm|sqft}} of office space.<ref>"[http://www.spiegel.de/international/hafencity-headquarters-spiegel-moves-to-a-new-home-a-789735.html HafenCity Headquarters: SPIEGEL Moves to a New Home]" ([http://www.webcitation.org/6aNcs5n6d Archive]).
