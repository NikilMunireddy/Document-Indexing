'''Diana Ernestine Earle Ross''' (born March 26, 1944) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and record producer. Born and raised in [[Detroit, MI|Detroit]], she rose to fame as a founding member and lead singer of the vocal group [[The Supremes]], which, during the 1960s, became [[Motown Records|Motown's]] most successful act and is to this day America's most successful vocal group as well as one of the world's [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups]] of all time.
As part of the Supremes, her success made it possible for future African American [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and soul acts to find mainstream success. The group released a record setting, twelve number-one hit singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] including the hits "[[Where Did Our Love Go]]", "[[Baby Love]]", "[[Come See About Me]]", "[[Stop! In the Name of Love]]", "[[You Can't Hurry Love]]", "[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]", "[[Love Child (song)|Love Child]]" and "[[Someday We'll Be Together#DianaRossandtheSupremes|Someday We'll Be Together]]".

Following her departure from the Supremes in 1970, Ross released her debut solo album, ''[[Diana Ross (1970 album)|Diana Ross]]'', which contained the hits "[[Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)]]" and the number-one hit "[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]". She released the album ''[[Touch Me in the Morning (album)|Touch Me in the Morning]]'' in 1973. Its [[Touch Me in the Morning|title track]] reached number 1, becoming her second solo hit. By 1975, the ''[[Mahogany (soundtrack)|Mahogany]]'' soundtrack included her 3rd number-one hit "[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)]]". Her 1976 album ''[[Diana Ross (1976 album)|Diana Ross]]'' included her fourth number-one hit "[[Love Hangover]]". In 1979, Ross released the album ''[[The Boss (Diana Ross album)|The Boss]]''. Her 1980 album ''[[Diana (album)|Diana]]'' which reached number 2 on the ''Billboard'' albums chart and spawned the number-one hit "[[Upside Down]]" and the international hit "[[I'm Coming Out]]". After leaving Motown, Ross achieved her sixth and final number-one hit with the duet "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]".

Ross also ventured into acting, with a [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[Academy Award]] nominated performance in ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'' (1972). She also starred in two other feature films, ''[[Mahogany (film)|Mahogany]]'' (1975) and the ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978); later acting included roles in the television films ''[[Out of Darkness]]'' (1994), for which she also was nominated for a Golden Globe Award, and ''[[Double Platinum (film)|Double Platinum]]'' (1999).

Ross was named the "Female Entertainer of the Century" by ''Billboard'' magazine. In 1993, the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' declared Ross the most successful female music artist in history due to her success in the United States and United Kingdom for having more hits than any female artist in the charts with a career total of 70 hit singles with her work with the Supremes and as a solo artist. Ross has sold more than 100 million records worldwide when her releases with the Supremes and as a solo artist are tallied.

In 1988, Ross was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as member of the Supremes alongside Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard. She is the recipient of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 2007. She is a 12-time Grammy nominee, never earning a competitive honor, but later becoming the recipient of the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2012.

Much has been made of whether her first name ends in an "a" or an "e". According to Ross, her mother actually named her "Diane" but a clerical error resulted in her name being recorded as "Diana" on her birth certificate. Although she was sometimes listed as "Diana" during the first Supremes records, she introduced herself as "Diane" until early in the group's heyday. Her friends still call her "Diane".<ref>{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Mary|title=Dreamgirl: My Life as a Supreme|year=1986|publisher=Cooper Square Press|isbn=0-8154-1000-X|pages=169–170}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=George|first=Nelson|title=Where Did Our Love Go?

Ross, a native of [[Gloucester County, Virginia]], was born to Washington Ross and Virginia Baytop. Virginia Baytop's mother Francis "Frankey" Baytop was a former slave who had become a [[Midwifery|midwife]] after the Civil War.

Ross and her family originally lived at Belmont Road in the [[North End, Detroit|North End]] section of Detroit, near Highland Park, MI, where she was neighbors with singer [[Smokey Robinson]]. When Ross was seven, her mother contracted tuberculosis, causing her to become seriously ill. Ross' father moved his children to live with relatives in Bessemer, Alabama. After her mother recovered, her family moved back to Detroit.<ref>{{cite web<!--|url=http://www.musicbyday.com/diana-ross-was-born-on-march-26-1944/425/--> |title=Diana Ross Was Born on March 26, 1944 &#124; Music Trivia web |url=http://blackhistory.com/content/65381/diana-ross|website=blackhistory.com|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}</ref> On her 14th birthday in 1958, her family relocated to the working-class [[Brewster-Douglass housing projects]] settling at St. Antoine Street.

Ross also worked at Hudson's Department Store where, it was claimed in biographies, she was the first black employee "allowed outside the kitchen".{{sfn|Taraborelli|2008|p=64}} For extra income, she provided hairdressing services for her neighbors. Ross graduated from Cass Tech in January 1962.

==Career==

===The Supremes: 1959-1968 ===
{{Main|The Supremes}}
[[File:1966 The Supremes.JPG|thumb|left|194x194px|Diana Ross (far right) performing with [[the Supremes]] as lead singer]]

At fifteen, Ross joined the Primettes, a sister group of a male vocal group called the Primes, after being brought to the attention of music manager Milton Jenkins by Primes member [[Paul Williams (The Temptations)|Paul Williams]]. Along with Ross, the other members included [[Florence Ballard]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] and [[Betty McGlown]]. Following a talent competition win in [[Windsor, Ontario]], in 1960, the Primettes auditioned for [[Motown Records]]. In [[Berry Gordy]]'s autobiography, ''To Be Loved'', Gordy recalled he was heading to a business meeting when he heard Ross singing "There Goes My Baby" and Ross's voice "stopped me in my tracks". He then approached the group and asked them to perform it again. Learning of their ages, Gordy advised them to come back after graduation.<ref name=pc26>{{Pop Chronicles |26 |4}}</ref>

Undeterred, Ross brought the group to Motown's [[Hitsville U.S.A.]] headquarters daily, offering to provide extra help for Motown's recordings, often including hand-claps and background vocals. That year, the group recorded two tracks for [[Lu Pine Records]], with Ross singing lead on one of the tracks. During the group's early years, Ross served as hair stylist, make-up artist, seamstress and costume designer. In late 1960, having replaced McGlown with [[Barbara Martin (singer)|Barbara Martin]], the Primettes were allowed to record songs by themselves at Hitsville's studio. In January 1961, Gordy agreed to sign the group on the condition they change their name. Eventually [[Janie Bradford]] had Florence Ballard pick out one of three names, to which Ballard went with "Supremes". Upon hearing of the new name, the other members weren't impressed, with Ross telling Ballard she feared the group would be mistaken for a male vocal group. Gordy signed the group under that name on January 15. A year later, Barbara Martin left the group, reducing the quartet to a trio. In late 1963, the group had their first hit with "[[When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes]]". At the end of the year, Gordy assigned Ross as the group's lead singer, as the group originally did not have a designated lead vocalist.

The group scored their first number-one hit with "[[Where Did Our Love Go]]", paving the way for unprecedented success: between August 1964 and May 1967, Ross, Wilson and Ballard sang on ten [[Billboard Hot 100|number-one hit singles]], all of which also made the UK top 40.<ref name=pc26/> The group had also become a hit with audiences both domestically and abroad, going on to become Motown's most successful vocal act throughout the sixties. Following significant issues with her comportment, weight, and alcoholism, Florence Ballard was fired from the Supremes by Gordy in July 1967, hiring [[Cindy Birdsong]] from [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle and the Blue-Bells]] as Ballard's replacement. Simultaneously, Gordy renamed the group ''Diana Ross & the Supremes'', made it easier to charge a larger performance fee for a solo star and a backing group, as it did for other renamed Motown groups. Gordy initially thought of Ross leaving the Supremes for a solo career in 1966, changing his mind when he figured the group's success was still too significant for Ross to pursue solo obligations. Ross would remain with the group until early 1970.

The group appeared as a trio of singing nuns in a 1968 episode of the popular [[NBC]] TV series ''[[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]]''. Between their early 1968 single "[[Forever Came Today]]" and their final single with Ross, "[[Someday We'll Be Together]]", Ross would be the only Supremes member to be featured on many of their recordings, accompanied by [[session singer]]s [[the Andantes]].<ref>Benjaminson, Peter. ''The Lost Supreme: The Life of Dreamgirl Florence Ballard''. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, November 2007. 75–79. ISBN 1-55652-705-5</ref> Gordy worked Ross diligently throughout this period and Ross, due to anxiety arising from Gordy's demands of her, began suffering from [[anorexia nervosa]], according to her autobiography, ''Secrets of A Sparrow''. 

[[File:The Supremes 1967.JPG|thumb|right|320x222px|Diana Ross with [[the Supremes]] in 1967]]

In 1968, Ross started performing as a solo artist on television specials, including the Supremes' own specials such as ''[[TCB (television special)|TCB]]'' and ''[[G.I.T. on Broadway]]'', ''[[The Dinah Shore Show]]'' and a [[Bob Hope]] special, among others. In mid-1969, Gordy decided that Ross would depart the group by the end of that year, and Ross began recording her initial solo work that July. One of the first plans for Ross to establish her own solo career was to publicly introduce a new Motown recording act. Though she herself did not claim their discovery, Motown pinned Ross as having discovered [[the Jackson 5]]. Ross would introduce the group during several public events, including ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]''.<ref name="Jackson5">{{cite book|last=George|first=Nelson|title=Where Did Our Love Go?

Ross' presumed first solo recording, "Someday We'll Be Together", was eventually released as a Supremes recording and became the group's final number-one hit on the Hot 100. It was also the final number-one ''Billboard'' Hot 100 single of the 1960s. Ross made her final appearance with the Supremes at the [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|Frontier Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] on January 14, 197

===Early solo career: 1970–81===
[[File:Dianasolo.jpg|thumb|204x204px|Ross's debut solo album, ''[[Diana Ross (1970 album)|Diana Ross]]'', on Motown Records released in 1970.]]
In May 1970, Ross released her eponymous [[Diana Ross (1970 album)|solo debut]], which included her [[signature song]]s, "[[Reach Out and Touch (Somebody's Hand)]]" and "[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]", the latter becoming Ross' first [[Billboard Hot 100|number-one solo single]]. Follow-up albums, ''[[Everything Is Everything (Diana Ross album)|Everything Is Everything]]'' and ''[[Surrender (Diana Ross album)|Surrender]]'' , came out shortly afterwards. In 1971, the ballad "[[I'm Still Waiting]]" became her first number-one single in the [[Official Charts Company|UK]]. Later in 1971, Ross starred in her first solo [[television special]], ''Diana!'', which included [[The Jackson 5]]. In 1972, the [[Lady Sings the Blues (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to her film debut, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]]'', reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling two million units. In 1973, Ross had her second number-one hit with the ballad "[[Touch Me in the Morning]]". Later in the year, Motown issued ''[[Diana & Marvin]]'', a duet album with fellow Motown artist [[Marvin Gaye]]. The album became an international hit. Touring throughout 1973, Ross became the first entertainer in Japan's history to receive an invitation to the Imperial Palace for a private audience with the Empress Nagako, wife of Emperor Hirohito.{{sfn|''Jet''|1973|p = 60}}

{{listen|filename=I'm Coming Out by Diana Ross.ogg|title="I'm Coming Out"|description="I'm Coming Out" was a hit single released in 1980, written and produced by [[Chic (band)|Chic]] members [[Bernard Edwards]] and [[Nile Rodgers]] for her album ''Diana''.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

After the release of a modestly successful LP, ''[[Last Time I Saw Him]]'', Ross had a third number-one hit with "[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)]]", from her second feature film, ''[[Mahogany (film)|Mahogany]]''. A year later, in 1976, she began recording [[disco]] music, scoring with the international hit, "[[Love Hangover]]", which gave the singer a fourth chart-topper in the US. A two-week stint at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]'s [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] in 1977 led to the [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated television special, ''An Evening with Diana Ross'', and a [[Special Tony Award]]. After the albums, ''[[Baby It's Me]]'' and ''[[Ross (1978 album)|Ross]]'', tanked, she released ''[[The Boss (Diana Ross album)|The Boss]]'', in 1979. That album continued her popularity with dance audiences as [[The Boss (Diana Ross song)|the title song]] became a number-one dance single. That year, Ross hosted her own [[HBO]] special, ''Standing Room Only'', taken place in Las Vegas during Ross' "Tour '79" concert tour, with most of the performances coming from ''The Boss'' album. In 1980, Ross released her most successful album to date, ''[[Diana (album)|diana]]''. Composed by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s [[Nile Rodgers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]], the album included the hits "[[I'm Coming Out]]" and "[[Upside Down]]", the latter becoming her fifth chart-topping single. Prior to leaving Motown, Ross recorded the duet ballad "[[Endless Love (song)|Endless Love]]", with [[Lionel Richie]]. The song would become her sixth and final single to reach number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

Ross began negotiating to leave Motown at the end of 1980 after discovering she only had access to $300,000 USD, despite making millions of dollars for the label. Ross eventually was offered a $20 million deal with [[RCA Records]]. Before making the decision, she had a conversation with Berry Gordy over the deal to see if he could match it. When Gordy told her it was impossible to match, Ross eventually decided to sign with RCA, doing so on May 20, 1981, making the deal at the time, the most lucrative contract in music.

===Film career: 1972–99===
{{Main|Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Mahogany (film)|The Wiz (film)|Out of Darkness|Double Platinum (film)}}
In 1971, Diana Ross began working on her first film, ''[[Lady Sings the Blues (film)|Lady Sings the Blues]],'' which was a loosely based biography on singer [[Billie Holiday]]. Despite some criticism of her for taking the role, once the film opened in October 1972, Ross won critical acclaim for her performance in the film. Jazz critic Leonard Feather, a friend of Holiday's, praised Ross for "expertly capturing the essence of Lady Day". Ross's role in the film won her [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[Academy Award]] nominations for Best Actress. The [[Lady Sings the Blues (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''Lady Sings the Blues'' became just as successful, reaching No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] staying there for two weeks. [[File:Diana Ross 1976.jpg|thumb|left|205x240px|Diana Ross in August 1976]]

Ross's second film, ''[[Mahogany (film)|Mahogany]]'', was released in 1975. The film reunited her with [[Billy Dee Williams]], her co-star in ''Lady Sings the Blues'', and featured costumes designed by Ross herself. The story of an aspiring fashion designer who becomes a runway model and the toast of the industry, ''Mahogany'' was a troubled production from its inception. The film's original director, [[Tony Richardson]], was fired during production, and Berry Gordy assumed the director's chair himself. In addition, Gordy and Ross clashed during filming, with Ross leaving the production before shooting was completed, forcing Gordy to use secretary Edna Anderson as a body double for Ross. While a box office success, the film was not well received by the critics: ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' magazine's review of the film chastised Gordy for "squandering one of America's most natural resources: Diana Ross".<ref>Posner, Gerald. ''Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power,'' p. 286.</ref>

In 1977, Motown acquired the film rights to the Broadway play ''[[The Wiz]],'' an African-American reinterpretation of [[L. Frank Baum]]'s ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]].'' The film initially was to include the stage actors who had performed on the play. However, the role of Dorothy, which had been performed onstage by [[Stephanie Mills]], would be given to Ross after she convinced film producer [[Rob Cohen]] to cast her in the role of Dorothy. This decision eventually led to a change in the film's script in which Dorothy went from a schoolgirl to a schoolteacher. The role of the Scarecrow, also performed by someone else onstage, was eventually given to Ross's former Motown label mate, [[Michael Jackson]]. The [[The Wiz (film)|film adaptation of ''The Wiz'']] had been a $24 million production, but upon its October 1978 release, it earned only $21,049,053 at the box office.<ref name="sharp">{{cite book |last=Sharp |first =Kathleen |title =Mr. and Mrs. Hollywood: Edie and Lew Wasserman and Their Entertainment Empire |publisher =Carroll & Graf Publishers |year =2003 |pages =357–58 |id = |isbn = 0-7867-1220-1}}</ref><ref name="harpole" /><ref name="dreamgirl">{{cite book |last =Adrahtas |first =Thomas |title =A Lifetime to Get Here: Diana Ross: The American Dreamgirl |publisher =AuthorHouse |year =2006 |pages =163–67 |id = |isbn = 1-4259-7140-7}}</ref> Though pre-release television broadcast rights had been sold to [[CBS]] for over $10 million, the film produced a net loss of $10.4 million for Motown and Universal.<ref name="harpole">{{cite book | last =Harpole | first =Charles | title =History of the American Cinema | publisher =Simon and Schuster | year =2003 | pages =64, 65, 219, 220, 290 | id = | isbn = 0-684-80463-8}}</ref><ref name="dreamgirl"/> At the time, it was the most expensive film musical ever made.<ref name="skow">{{cite news | last=Skow | first =John |title =Nowhere Over the Rainbow |work =[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |publisher =[[Time Warner]] |date =October 30, 1978 |url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,912236,00.html |accessdate =November 6, 2007}}</ref> The film's failure ended Ross's short career on the big screen and contributed to the Hollywood studios's reluctance to produce the all-black film projects which had become popular during the [[blaxploitation]] era of the early to mid-1970s for several years.<ref>{{cite book |last=Moon |first =Spencer |author2=George Hill |title=Reel Black Talk: A Sourcebook of 50 American Filmmakers |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1997 |id= |isbn=0-313-29830-0 |nopp=true |page =xii}}</ref><ref name="benshoff">{{cite book |last=Benshoff |first=Harry M. |author2=Sean Griffin |title =America on Film: Representing Race, Class, Gender, and Sexuality at the Movies |publisher =Blackwell Publishing |year =2004 |id = |isbn = 0-631-22583-8 |page =88}}</ref><ref name="George">{{cite book | last =George |first =Nelson |title =Where Did Our Love Go?

Ross had success with movie-themed songs. While her version of Holiday's "[[Good Morning Heartache]]" only performed modestly well in early 1973, her recording of "[[Theme from Mahogany (Do You Know Where You're Going To)]]" gave Ross her third number-one hit, in late 1975. Three years later, Ross and Michael Jackson had a modest dance hit with their recording of "[[Ease on Down the Road]]". Their second duet, actually as part of the ensemble of ''The Wiz,'' "Brand New Day", found some success overseas. Ross scored a Top 10 hit in late 1980 with the theme song to the 1980 film ''[[It's My Turn (film)|It's My Turn]].'' The following year, she collaborated with former [[Commodores]] singer-songwriter [[Lionel Richie]] on the theme song for the film ''[[Endless Love (1981 film)|Endless Love]].'' The [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[Endless Love (song)|title single]] became her final hit on Motown Records, and the number-one record of the year. Several years later, in 1988, Ross recorded the theme song to ''[[The Land Before Time]].'' "If We Hold on Together" became an international hit, reaching number one in Japan.

In 1993, Ross returned to acting with a dramatic role in the television film, ''[[Out of Darkness]].'' Ross won acclaim for her role in the TV movie and earned her third [[Golden Globe]] nomination, although she did not win. In 1999, she and [[Brandy Norwood]] co-starred in the television movie, ''[[Double Platinum (film)|Double Platinum]],'' which was aired prior to the release of Ross's album, ''[[Every Day Is a New Day]].''

===Continued solo career and development: 1981–99===
[[File:DianaRossPlayground NYC.jpg|thumb|177x177px|The [[Diana Ross Playground]]]]
In October 1981, Ross released her first RCA album, ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (album)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]].'' The album sold over a million copies and featured hit singles such as her remake of the [[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (song)|classic hit of the same name]] and "[[Mirror Mirror (Diana Ross song)|Mirror Mirror]]". At this same approximate time, Ross established her own production company, which she named Anaid Productions (the "Anaid" being "Diana" backwards), and also started investing in real estate, while also touring extensively in the United States and abroad. Before the release of ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' Ross hosted her first TV special in four years, featuring Michael Jackson in the special. In early 1982, Ross sang the "[[Star-Spangled Banner]]" at [[Super Bowl XVI]] and appeared on the dance show ''[[Soul Train]].'' The program devoted a full episode to her and Ross performed several songs from the ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' album.

In 1982, she followed up the success of ''Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' with ''[[Silk Electric]],'' which featured the Michael Jackson-written and -produced, "[[Muscles (song)|Muscles]]", resulting in another top-ten success for Ross. The album eventually went gold on the strength of that song. In 1983, Ross ventured further out of her earlier soul-based sound for a more [[pop rock]]-oriented sound following the release of the ''[[Ross (1983 album)|Ross]]'' album. Though the album featured the hit single, "[[Pieces of Ice]]", whose music video garnered heavy rotation on video channel stations, except on MTV, the ''Ross'' album failed to generate any more hits and failed to go gold, dropping out of the charts as quickly as it entered. On July 21, 1983, Ross performed a concert in [[Central Park]] for a taped [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] special. Proceeds of the concert would be donated to build a playground in the singer's name. Midway through the beginning of the show, a torrential downpour occurred. Ross tried to keep on performing, but the severe weather required that the show be stopped. Ross urged the large crowd to exit the venue safely, promising to perform the next day.

The second concert held the very next day was without rain. The funds for the playground were to be derived from sales of different items at the concert; however, all profits earned from the first concert were spent on the second. When the mainstream media discovered the exorbitant costs of the two concerts, Ross faced criticism and poor publicity. Although her representatives originally refused to pay anything for the proposed playground, Ross herself later paid, out of pocket, the $150,000 required to build the park. The [[Diana Ross Playground]] was finally built three years later.<ref>Anderson, Susan Heller and Deirdre Carmody (September 12, 1986).

In 1984, Ross released ''[[Swept Away (Diana Ross album)|Swept Away]].'' This featured a duet with [[Julio Iglesias]], "[[All of You (Julio Iglesias and Diana Ross song)|All of You]]", which was featured on both the albums they had then released—his ''[[1100 Bel Air Place]]'' as well as her ''Swept Away.'' It became international hit, as did the ballad "[[Missing You (Diana Ross song)|Missing You]]", which was a tribute to [[Marvin Gaye]], who [[Death of Marvin Gaye|had died earlier that year]] after the moving poignant music video made a rare premiere on that year's American Music Awards show. [[Swept Away (Diana Ross album)|Swept Away]] proved to be a success garnering gold level sales.

Her 1985 album, ''[[Eaten Alive (album)|Eaten Alive]],'' found major success overseas with [[Eaten Alive (song)|the title track]] and "[[Chain Reaction (song)|Chain Reaction]]", although neither of the songs became the best-sellers she was once accustomed to in America. Both songs had strong music videos that propelled the tracks to success. The [[Eaten Alive]] video was patterned after the 1960s horror film, ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau]]'', while the "[[Chain Reaction (song)|Chain Reaction]]" music video saluted the 1960s [[American Bandstand]]. "Experience", the third international single's video reignited the "Eaten Alive" romantic storyline with Diana and American actor, [[Joseph Gian]]. The track, [[Eaten Alive]], a collaboration with Barry Gibb and Michael Jackson, became a top 20 hit internationally. The [[Barry Gibb]]-produced album garnered an international number one in "[[Chain Reaction (song)|Chain Reaction]]" and a Top 20 selling album.

Earlier in 1985, she had appeared as part of [[USA for Africa]] on the '"[[We Are the World]]"' charity single, which sold over 20 million copies worldwide. Ross's 1987 followup to ''Eaten Alive,'' ''[[Red Hot Rhythm & Blues]],'' found less success than the prior album. However, the accompanying acclaimed television special was nominated for several Emmys (4).

In 1988, Ross chose to not renew her RCA contract. Around this same time, Ross had been in talks with her former mentor Berry Gordy to return to Motown. When she learned of Gordy's plans to sell Motown, Ross tried advising him against the decision though he sold it to MCA Records in 1988. (The first and only single, "[[If We Hold on Together]]", theme song from the Steven Spielberg animated film, ''[[The Land Before Time]]'', became a huge number-one international single in Japan and currently ranks as the #24th Best Selling International Single of All Time in Japan).  Following this decision, Gordy offered Ross a new contract to return to Motown with the condition that she have shares in the company as a part-owner. Ross accepted the offer.

Despite its heavy promotion, Diana's next album, ''[[Workin' Overtime]],'' was a critical and commercial failure. Subsequent follow-ups such as ''[[The Force Behind the Power]]'' (1991), ''[[Take Me Higher]]'' (1995), and ''[[Every Day Is a New Day]]'' (1999) produced similarly disappointing sales. Ross had more success overseas with the albums than she did in America.

In 1991, Ross became one of the few American artists to have headlined the annual [[Royal Variety Performance]], when she performed a selection of her UK hits in the presence of [[Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] at the [[Victoria Palace Theatre]], London.

"[[The Force Behind the Power]]" sparked an international comeback of sorts, when the album went [[double platinum]] in the UK.<ref>BPI 1991-UK, ''[[Music Week]]''.</ref> led by the No. 2 UK hit single "[[When You Tell Me That You Love Me]]". Ross would see the album perform successfully across Europe to Japan as "[[The Force Behind the Power]]" went gold there. That single would be a lucky charm when a duet version with Irish group, [[Westlife]] also hit No. 2 in the UK in 2005. The album produced an astounding 9 singles across international territories, including another Top 10, "One Shining Moment".

Ross had success in the UK through 1994, when "[[One Woman: The Ultimate Collection]]", a career retrospective compilation, would become number one in the UK, selling quadruple platinum in the UK. That album did well across Europe and in the [[anglosphere]]. The retrospective was EMI's alternative to Motown's box set ''[[Forever Diana: Musical Memoirs]]''. Ross's music sold well in international markets from 1991 to 1994.

Ross performed during the Opening Ceremony of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] held in Chicago and during the pre-match entertainment of the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup]] final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bloomfield|first=Craig|title=Grace Jones and FIFA, Diana Ross at USA 94 and six of the best unlikely entertainers at sport|url=http://talksport.com/magazine/features/2011-06-02/grace-jones-and-fifa-diana-ross-usa-94-and-six-best-unlikely-entertainers-sport|work=talksport.com|publisher=talkSPORT|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> On January 28, 1996, she performed the Halftime Show at [[Super Bowl XXX]].

In 1999, she was named the most successful female singer in the history of the United Kingdom charts, based upon a tally of her career hits. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] would eventually succeed Ross as the most successful female artist in the UK. Later that year, Ross presented at the [[1999 MTV Video Music Awards]] in September of the year and shocked the audience by touching [[rapper]] [[Lil' Kim]]'s exposed breast, pasty-covered nipple, amazed at the young rapper's brashness.<ref name=EW2002>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,345909__339339_4,00.html "Diana Ross and Lil' Kim's wild VMA moment"], Lisa Costantini, August 21, 2002, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]].''

===Supremes reunions, Return to Love, 2002 solo tour===
{{main|Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever|Return to Love Tour}}

Ross reunited with [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] first in 1976 to attend the funeral service of [[Florence Ballard]], who had died in February of that year. In March 1983, Ross agreed to reunite with Wilson and [[Cindy Birdsong]] for the television special "[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]". Wilson's arrival at the Pasadena Civic auditorium was late due to a delayed flight. The Supremes did not rehearse their performance for that evening.  A medley of hits was eliminated by request of Ross.<ref name="autogenerated1">Wilson, Mary. ''Dreamgirl, My Life As A Supreme''.</ref> Before the special was taped later that evening, Wilson allegedly planned with Birdsong to take a step forward every time Ross did the same. This appeared to frustrate Ross, causing her to push Wilson's shoulder. Ross momentarily forgot the lyrics to "[[Someday We'll Be Together]]".  Wilson began singing lead.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Later, Wilson was not aware of the script set by producer Suzanne DePasse, in which Ross was to introduce Berry Gordy. Wilson did so, at which point Ross pushed down Wilson's hand-held microphone, stating: "It's been taken care of." Ross, then, introduced Gordy.<ref>Wilson, Mary, ''Dreamgirl, My Life As A Supreme''; Taraborrelli, Randy, ''Call Her Miss Ross: The Unauthorized Biography of Diana Ross''; George, Nelson ''Where Did Our Love Go?, The Rise & Fall of Motown''.</ref><ref>Posner, Gerald.

In 1999, Ross and mega-tour promoter SFX (which later became [[LiveNation]]) began negotiations regarding a Diana Ross tour which would include a Supremes segment.  Due to public response the promoters floated the idea of a Supremes Tour instead.  Some fans suggested a Supremes tour in which all living former Supremes would participate. Neither [[Jean Terrell]] nor late 1970s member [[Susaye Greene]] chose to participate. [[Lynda Laurence]] and [[Scherrie Payne]] were then touring as members of the [[Former Ladies of the Supremes]]. Mary Wilson agreed to begin negotiations, as did Cindy Birdsong. Negotiations however to have the 1967–70 lineup of the group perform together for the first time in a concert tour since 1970 failed when Wilson and SFX could not to come to terms. SFX hired Payne and Laurence to sing with Ross on the tour.  Ross, Payne and Laurence had never performed together during their Supremes' tenures. Laurence and Payne would later say they got on well with Ross. The ''Return to Love'' tour launched in June 2000, to a capacity audience in Philadelphia, PA. The reunion tour, however, never made it through the first half due to a fan backlash public lack of interest.  It was cancelled mid-tour due to lagging ticket sales.  Some arenas barely filled to 25% capacity. Most believe there was lack of interest because of high ticket prices,overly large venues & Mary Wilson's negative campaign towards Ross & the former "Supremes" she had worked with in the '70s.<ref>Wilson, Mary.

In 2002, Ross entered rehabilitation in May, launched and cancelled a North America solo tour, and was arrested for a DUI in December. Ross cancelled the remaining dates of her summer concert tour of the United States and Canada two months after entering drug and alcohol rehabilitation center Promises, in Malibu, California in May to "clear up some personal issues". No reason was given for halting the 10-city North American tour, which began in April at New York's [[Westbury Music Fair]]. The 58-year-old singer performed gigs in Boston, Massachusetts, and Ontario, Canada, before her spokeswoman confirmed reports she had cancelled the rest of the dates.

In January 2008, at Jamaica's Air Jamaica Jazz & Blues Festival, Ross's performance was booed by audience members-seated near the rear of the venue-who were annoyed by her decision to turn off the large video screens adjacent to the stage. Later, the entire audience booed the festival's organizers, when Ross announced that the shortening of her set, in order to accommodate the schedule of r&b singer, Mary J. Blige, who arrived late and insisted upon being allowed to leave the festival earlier than previously planned. Ross returned to the festival in 2009, garnering positive reviews.
