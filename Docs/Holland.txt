'''Holland''' is a region and former province on the western coast of the [[Netherlands]]. The name ''Holland'' is also frequently used to informally refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and not entirely uncommon among the Dutch themselves, though some in the Netherlands and particularly in other regions of the country may find it undesirable,<ref name=MoFA>{{cite web |title=Holland or the Netherlands? |publisher=Dutch Embassy in Sweden |url=http://sweden.nlembassy.org/you-and-netherlands |accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref> misleading or insulting.<ref>page = 248, "Amsterdam: guida città",  Ryan Ver Berkmoes, EDT srl([[Lonely Planet]])</ref>

From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland proper was a unified political region within the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as a [[county]] ruled by the [[Count of Holland|Counts of Holland]]. By the 17th century, Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent [[Dutch Republic]].

The area of the former [[County of Holland]] roughly coincides with the two current Dutch [[Provinces of the Netherlands|provinces]] of [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]], which together include the Netherlands' three largest cities: the [[Capital of the Netherlands|capital city]] of [[Amsterdam]]; [[Rotterdam]], home of [[Port of Rotterdam|Europe's largest port]]; and the [[seat of government]] of [[The Hague]].

== Etymology and terminology ==
The name ''Holland'' first appeared in sources in 866 for the region around [[Haarlem]], and by 1064 was being used as the name of the entire county. By this time, the inhabitants of Holland were referring to themselves as "Hollanders".<ref>Antheun Janse, "Een zichzelf verdeeld rijk" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 1, p. 73</ref> ''Holland'' is derived from the Middle Dutch term ''holtland'' ("wooded land").<ref name=Oxford>''Oxford English Dictionary'', "Holland, n.1," etymology.</ref> This spelling variation remained in use until around the 14th century, at which time the name stabilised as ''Holland'' (alternative spellings at the time were ''Hollant'' and ''Hollandt''). A popular [[folk etymology]] holds that ''Holland'' is derived from ''hol land'' ("hollow land") and was inspired by the [[lowland|low-lying]] [[geography]] of Holland.<ref name=Oxford/>

The proper name of the area in both Dutch and English is "Holland". Holland is a part of the Netherlands. "Holland" is informally used in [[English language|English]] and other languages, including sometimes the [[Dutch language]] itself, to mean the whole of the modern country of the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Netherlands]].<ref name=MoFA/> This example of ''[[pars pro toto]]'' or [[synecdoche]] is similar to the tendency to refer to the United Kingdom as "England",<ref>"The majority of English people still behave as if 'English' and 'British' are synonymous", historian [[Norman Davies]] quoted in [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/255337.stm The English: Europe's lost tribe], BBC News Story, January 14, 1999</ref><ref>George Mikes, ''How to be an Alien'', "When people say England, they sometimes mean Great Britain, sometimes the United Kingdom, sometimes the British Isles - but never England."</ref> and developed due to Holland becoming the dominant province and thus having the majority of political and economic interactions with other countries.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/story/is-holland-the-same-place-as-the-netherlands]</ref>

The people of Holland are referred to as "Hollanders" in both Dutch and English. Today this refers specifically to people from the current provinces of North Holland and South Holland. Strictly speaking, the term "Hollanders" does not refer to people from the other provinces in the Netherlands, but colloquially "Hollanders" is sometimes used in this wider sense.

In Dutch, the Dutch word "''Hollands''" is the adjectival form for "''Holland''". The Dutch word "''Hollands''" is also colloquially and occasionally used by some Dutch people in the sense of "''Nederlands''" (Dutch), but then often with the intention of contrasting with other types of Dutch people or language, for example [[Limburgish]], the Belgian form of the Dutch language ("[[Flemish]]"), or even any southern variety of Dutch within the Netherlands itself.

In English, "Dutch" refers to the Netherlands as a whole, but there is no commonly used adjective for "Holland". The word "Hollandish" is no longer in common use. "[[Hollandic]]" is the name linguists give to the dialect spoken in Holland, and is occasionally also used by historians and when referring to pre-Napoleonic Holland.

== History ==
Initially, Holland was a remote corner of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Gradually, its regional importance increased until it began to have a decisive, and ultimately dominant, influence on the [[History of the Netherlands]].

=== County of Holland ===
{{Further|County of Holland}}
[[File:Counts of Holland Arms.svg|150px|thumb|right|[[Coat of arms]] of the County of Holland]]
Until the start of the 12th century, the inhabitants of the area that became Holland were known as [[Frisians]]. The area was initially part of [[Frisia]]. At the end of the 9th century, West-Frisia became a separate [[county]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The first [[Count of Holland|Count]] known about with certainty was [[Dirk I, Count of Holland|Dirk I]], who ruled from 896 to 931. He was succeeded by a [[Counts of Holland family tree|long line of counts]] in the House of Holland (who were in fact known as counts of Frisia until 1101). When [[John I, Count of Holland|John I]], count of Holland, died childless in 1299, the county was inherited by [[John II, Count of Holland|John II of Avesnes]], [[county of Hainaut|count of Hainaut]]. By the time of [[William V, Count of Holland|William V]] ([[House of Wittelsbach]]; 1354–1388) the count of Holland was also the count of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[Zeeland|Zealand]].

After the [[St. Lucia's flood]] in 1287 the part of [[Frisia]] west of the later [[Zuiderzee]], [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]], was conquered. As a result, most provincial institutions, including the [[States of Holland|States of Holland and West Frisia]], would for more then five centuries refer to "Holland and West Frisia" as a unit. The [[Hook and Cod wars]] started around this time and ended when the countess of Holland, Jacoba or [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut|Jacqueline]] was forced to give up Holland to the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian]] Philip III, known as [[Philip the Good]], in 1432.

In 1432, Holland became part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] and since 1477 of the [[Habsburg]] [[Seventeen Provinces]]. In the 16th century the county became the most densely [[urbanisation|urbanised]] region in Europe, with the majority of the population living in cities. Within the Burgundian Netherlands, Holland was the dominant province in the north; the political influence of Holland largely determined the extent of Burgundian dominion in that area. The last count of Holland was Philip III, better known as [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], king of Spain. He was deposed in 1581 by the [[Act of Abjuration]], although the kings of Spain continued to carry the titular appellation of Count of Holland until the [[Peace of Münster]] signed in 1648.

=== Dutch Republic ===
[[File:COMITATUS HOLLANDIAE 1682.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Holland from 1682.]]

In the Dutch Rebellion against the Habsburgs during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the naval forces of the rebels, the [[Watergeuzen]], established their first permanent base in 1572 in the town of [[Brielle|Brill]]. In this way, Holland, now a sovereign state in a larger Dutch confederation, became the centre of the rebellion. It became the cultural, political and economic centre of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] ({{Lang-nl|Verenigde Provinciën}}), in the 17th century, the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the wealthiest nation in the world. After the [[Act of Abjuration|King of Spain]] was deposed as the count of Holland, the executive and legislative power rested with the States of Holland, which was led by a political figure who held the office of [[Grand Pensionary]].

The largest cities in the [[Dutch Republic]] were in the province of Holland, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Leiden]], [[Alkmaar]], [[The Hague]], [[Delft]], [[Dordrecht]] and [[Haarlem]]. From the great ports of Holland, Hollandic merchants sailed to and from destinations all over [[Europe]], and merchants from all over Europe gathered to trade in the warehouses of Amsterdam and other trading cities of Holland.

Many Europeans thought of the United Provinces first as ''Holland'' rather than as the ''Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands''. A strong impression of ''Holland'' was planted in the minds of other Europeans, which then was projected back onto the Republic as a whole. Within the provinces themselves, a gradual slow process of cultural expansion took place, leading to a "Hollandification" of the other provinces and a more uniform culture for the whole of the Republic. The dialect of urban Holland became the [[standard language]].

=== Under French rule ===
{{Further|Kingdom of Holland}}

[[File:Departments of French Empire North 1811-ex.svg|thumb|Departments of French Empire North 1811]]

The formation of the [[Batavian Republic]], inspired by the [[French revolution]], led to a more centralised government. Holland became a province of a [[unitary state]]. Its independence was further reduced by an administrative reform in 1798, in which its territory was divided into several departments called ''Amstel'', ''Delf'', ''Texel'', and part of ''Schelde en Maas''.

From 1806 to 1810 [[Napoleon]] styled his vassal state, governed by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis Napoleon]] and shortly by the son of Louis, [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte]], as the "[[Kingdom of Holland]]". This kingdom encompassed much of what would become the modern Netherlands. The name reflects how natural at the time it had become to equate Holland with the non-Belgian Netherlands as a whole.<ref>Willem Frijhoff, "Hollands hegemonie" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2002, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 2, p. 468</ref>

During the period the Low Countries were annexed by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and actually incorporated into France (from 1810 to 1813), Holland was divided into [[département in France|département]]s [[Zuyderzée]], and [[Bouches-de-la-Meuse]]. From 1811 to 1813 [[Charles-François Lebrun, duc de Plaisance]] served as [[governor-general]]. He was assisted by Antoine de Celles, [[Goswin de Stassart]] and François Jean-Baptiste d'Alphonse.<ref>C.F. Gijsberti Hodenpijl (1904) Napoleon in Holland, p. 6-7.</ref>

=== Kingdom of the Netherlands ===
After 1813, Holland was restored as a province of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Holland was divided into the present provinces [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] in 1840, after the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830. This reflected a historical division of Holland along the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] into a Southern Quarter (''Zuiderkwartier'') and a Northern Quarter (''Noorderkwartier''),{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} but the actual division is different from the old division. From 1850, a strong process of [[nation building|nation formation]] took place, the Netherlands being culturally unified and economically integrated by a [[modernisation]] process, with the cities of Holland as its centre.<ref>Hans Knippenberg and Ben de Pater, "Brandpunt van macht en modernisering" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 548</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Further|Geography of the Netherlands}}
[[File:Provincie Noord-Holland.gif|thumb|right|North Holland]]
[[File:Provincie Zuid-Holland.gif|thumb|right|South Holland]]

Holland is situated in the west of the Netherlands. A maritime region, Holland lies on the [[North Sea]] at the mouths of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse]] ([[Meuse (river)|Maas]]). It has numerous rivers and lakes and an extensive inland canal and waterway system. To the south is [[Zeeland|Zealand]]. The region is bordered on the east by the [[IJsselmeer]] and four different provinces of the Netherlands.

Holland is protected from the sea by a long line of coastal [[dunes]]. Most of the land area behind the dunes consists of [[polder]] landscape lying well below [[sea level]].  At present the lowest point in Holland is a polder near [[Rotterdam]], which is about seven meters below sea level. Continuous drainage is necessary to keep Holland from flooding. In earlier centuries [[windmill]]s were used for this task. The landscape was (and in places still is) dotted with windmills, which have become a symbol of Holland.

Holland is 7,494 square kilometres (land and water included), making it roughly 13% of the area of the Netherlands. Looking at land alone, it is 5,488 square kilometres in size. The combined population is 6.1&nbsp;million.

The main cities in Holland are Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. [[Amsterdam]] is formally the [[capital of the Netherlands]] and its largest city. The [[Port of Rotterdam]] is Europe's largest and most important harbour and port. [[The Hague]] is the [[seat of government]] of the Netherlands. These cities, combined with [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and other smaller municipalities, effectively form a single [[metroplex]]—a conurbation called [[Randstad]].

The Randstad area is one of the most densely populated regions of Europe, but still relatively free of urban sprawl. There are strict [[zoning laws]]. Population pressures are enormous, property values are high, and new housing is constantly under development on the edges of the built-up areas. Surprisingly, much of the province still has a rural character. The remaining agricultural land and natural areas are highly valued and protected. Most of the arable land is used for [[intensive agriculture]], including horticulture and [[greenhouse]] agri-businesses.

=== Reclamation of the land ===
[[File:Benthuizen dijk polder.jpg|thumb|left|Benthuizen polder, as seen from a dike.]]
The land that is now Holland had never been stable. Over the millennia the geography of the region had been dynamic. The western coastline shifted up to thirty kilometres to the east and storm surges regularly broke through the row of coastal dunes. The [[Frisian Islands|Frisian Isles]], originally joined to the mainland, became detached islands in the north. The main rivers, the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse River|Meuse (Maas)]], flooded regularly and changed course repeatedly and dramatically.

The people of Holland found themselves living in an unstable, watery environment. Behind the [[dunes]] on the coast of the Netherlands a high [[peat]] plateau had grown, forming a natural protection against the sea. Much of the area was [[marsh]] and [[bog]]. By the tenth century the inhabitants set about cultivating this land by draining it. However, the drainage resulted in extreme soil shrinkage, lowering the surface of the land by up to fifteen metres.

To the south of Holland, in [[Zeeland]], and to the north, in [[Frisia]], this development led to [[Floods in the Netherlands|catastrophic storm floods]] literally washing away entire regions, as the peat layer disintegrated or became detached and was carried away by the flood water. From the Frisian side the sea even flooded the area to the east, gradually hollowing Holland out from behind and forming the [[Zuiderzee]] (the present IJsselmeer). This inland sea threatened to link up with the "drowned lands" of Zealand in the south, reducing Holland to a series of narrow dune [[barrier island]]s in front of a [[lagoon]]. Only drastic administrative intervention saved the county from utter destruction. The counts and large monasteries took the lead in these efforts, building the first heavy emergency [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to bolster critical points. Later special autonomous administrative bodies were formed, the ''[[waterschap]]pen'' ("water control boards"), which had the legal power to enforce their regulations and decisions on [[water management]]. As the centuries went by, they eventually constructed an extensive dike system that covered the coastline and the polders, thus protecting the land from further incursions by the sea.

However, the Hollanders did not stop there. Starting around the 16th century, they took the offensive and began [[land reclamation]] projects, converting lakes, marshy areas and adjoining mudflats into [[polders]]. This continued right into the 20th century. As a result, historical maps of mediaeval and early modern Holland bear little resemblance to the maps of today.

This ongoing struggle to master the water played an important role in the development of Holland as a maritime and economic power and in the development of the character of the people of Holland.

== Culture ==
Holland tends to be associated with a particular image. The stereotypical image of Holland is an artificial amalgam of [[tulip]]s, [[windmill]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|clogs]], [[cheese]] and traditional dress (''klederdracht''). As is the case with many stereotypes, this is far from the truth and reality of life in Holland. This can at least in part be explained by the active exploitation of these stereotypes in promotions of Holland and the Netherlands. In fact only in a few of the more traditional villages, such as Volendam and locations in the [[Zaan]] area, are the different costumes with wooden shoes still worn by some inhabitants.

The predominance of Holland in the Netherlands has resulted in [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] on the part of the other provinces. This is a reaction to the perceived threat that Holland poses to the identities and local cultures of the other provinces. The other provinces have a strong, and often negative,<ref>Rob van Ginkel, "Hollandse Tonelen" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 688</ref> image of Holland and the Hollanders, to whom certain qualities are ascribed within a [[mental geography]], a conceptual mapping of spaces and their inhabitants.<ref name = "bwgsuh">Hans Knippenberg and Ben de Pater, "Brandpunt van macht en modernisering" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 556</ref> On the other hand, some Hollanders take Holland's cultural dominance for granted and treat the concepts of "Holland" and the "Netherlands" as coincidental. Consequently, they see themselves not primarily as "Hollanders", but simply as "Dutch" (''Nederlanders'').<ref>Thimo de Nijs, "Hollandse identiteit in perspectief" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 700</ref> This phenomenon has been called "hollandocentrism".<ref>Rob van Ginkel, "Hollandse Tonelen" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 647</ref>

=== Language ===

The predominant language spoken in Holland is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Hollanders sometimes refer to the Dutch language as "''Hollands,''"<ref>''Dutch: An Essential Grammar'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=p9d9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT15&dq= p.15], William Z. Shetter, Esther Ham, Routlege, 2007</ref> instead of the standard term ''Nederlands''. Inhabitants of Belgium and other provinces of the Netherlands refer to "Hollands" to indicate someone speaking in a [[Hollandic]] dialect, or strong accent.

Standard Dutch was historically largely based on the dialect of the [[County of Holland]], incorporating many traits derived from the dialects of the previously more powerful [[Duchy of Brabant]] and [[County of Flanders]]. Strong dialectal variation still exists throughout the [[Low Countries]]. Today, Holland-proper is the region where the original dialects are least spoken, in many areas having been completely replaced by standard Dutch, and the [[Randstad]] has the largest influence on the developments of the standard language—with the exception of the Dutch spoken in Belgium.<ref>Sijs, Nicoline van der, 2006, ''De geschiedenis van het Nederlands in een notendop'', Amsterdam, Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, pp. 127–128</ref>

Despite this correspondence between standard Dutch and the Dutch spoken in the Randstad, there are local variations within Holland itself that differ from standard Dutch. The main cities each have their own modern urban dialect, that can be considered a [[sociolect]].<ref>Sijs, Nicoline van der, 2006, ''De geschiedenis van het Nederlands in een notendop'', Amsterdam, Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, pp. 123</ref> A small number of people, especially in the area north of Amsterdam, still speak the original dialect of the county, Hollandic.  The Hollandic dialect is present in the north: [[Volendam]] and [[Marken]] and the area around there, [[West Friesland (region)|West Friesland]] and the [[Zaanstreek]]; and in a south-eastern fringe bordering on the provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Utrecht]]. In the south on the island of [[Goeree-Overflakkee]], [[Zealandic]] is spoken.

== New Holland ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The province of Holland gave its name to a number of colonial settlements and discovered regions that were called ''Nieuw Holland'' or [[New Holland (disambiguation)|New Holland]]. The most extensive of these was the island continent presently known as [[Australia]]: [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] was first applied to Australia in 1644 by the Dutch seafarer [[Abel Tasman]] as a [[Latin]] ''Nova Hollandia'', and remained in international use for 190 years. On the same voyage he named [[New Zealand]] after the Dutch province of [[Zeeland]]. In the Netherlands ''Nieuw Holland'' would remain the usual name of the continent until the end of the 19th century; it is now no longer in use there, the Dutch name today being ''Australië''.
