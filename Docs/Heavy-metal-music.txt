'''Heavy metal''' (or simply '''metal''') is a genre of [[rock music]]<ref>Du Noyer (2003), p. 96; Weinstein (2000), pp. 11–13.</ref> that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States.<ref>Weinstein (2000), pp. 14, 118.</ref> With roots in [[blues rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]],<ref name=fast/> the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified [[distortion (music)|distortion]], extended [[guitar solo]]s, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with [[masculinity]], [[aggression]], and [[machismo]].<ref name=fast>Fast (2005), pp. 89–91; Weinstein (2000), pp. 7, 8, 23, 36, 103, 104.</ref>

The first heavy metal bands such as [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Black Sabbath]] and [[Deep Purple]] attracted large audiences, though they were often derided by critics, a status common throughout the history of the genre. During the mid-1970s, [[Judas Priest]] helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its [[blues]] influence;<ref name="Walser 1993, p. 6">Walser (1993), p. 6.</ref><ref>"As much as Sabbath started it, Priest were the ones who took it out of the blues and straight into metal." Bowe, Brian J. ''Judas Priest: Metal Gods''. ISBN 0-7660-3621-9.</ref> [[Motörhead]] introduced a [[punk rock]] sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]] such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] followed in a similar vein. Before the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as "[[Heavy metal subculture|metalheads]]" or "[[headbanging|headbangers]]".

During the 1980s, [[glam metal]] became a commercial force with groups such as [[Mötley Crüe]] and [[Poison (American band)|Poison]]. [[Underground music|Underground scenes]] produced an array of more aggressive styles: [[thrash metal]] broke into the mainstream with bands such as [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]], and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], while other [[extreme metal|extreme subgenres of metal]] such as [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] remain [[subculture|subcultural]] phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded the definition of the genre. These include [[groove metal]] (with bands such as [[Pantera]]) and [[nu metal]] (with bands such as [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Korn]] and [[Linkin Park]]), the latter of which often incorporates elements of [[grunge]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].<!-- Note: Details of the lead section are usually inline cited in the body of the article per [[WP:LEAD]], not the lead section itself.

==Characteristics==
Heavy metal is traditionally characterized by loud distorted guitars, emphatic rhythms, dense bass-and-drum sound, and vigorous vocals. Metal subgenres variously emphasize, alter, or omit one or more of these attributes. ''[[New York Times]]'' critic [[Jon Pareles]] writes, "In the taxonomy of popular music, heavy metal is a major subspecies of hard-rock—the breed with less syncopation, less blues, more showmanship and more brute force."<ref name=JP>Pareles, Jon.

Retrieved on November 14, 2007.</ref> The typical band lineup includes a [[drummer]], a [[Heavy metal bass|bassist]], a [[rhythm guitar]]ist, a [[lead guitar]]ist, and a singer, who may or may not be an instrumentalist. [[Keyboard instruments]] are sometimes used to enhance the fullness of the sound.<ref name=W25>Weinstein (2000), p. 25</ref>

The [[electric guitar]] and the sonic power that it projects through amplification has historically been the key element in heavy metal.<ref name=W23>Weinstein (2000), p. 23</ref> The heavy metal guitar sound comes from a combined use of high volumes and heavy [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]].<ref>Walser, Robert (1993).

The lead role of the guitar in heavy metal often collides with the traditional "frontman" or bandleader role of the vocalist, creating a musical tension as the two "contend for dominance" in a spirit of "affectionate rivalry".<ref name=W25/> Heavy metal "demands the subordination of the voice" to the overall sound of the band. Reflecting metal's roots in the 1960s counterculture, an "explicit display of emotion" is required from the vocals as a sign of authenticity.<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 26</ref> Critic [[Simon Frith]] claims that the metal singer's "tone of voice" is more important than the lyrics.<ref>Cited in Weinstein (2000), p. 26</ref>

The prominent role of the bass is also key to the metal sound, and the interplay of bass and guitar is a central element. The bass guitar provides the low-end sound crucial to making the music "heavy".<ref name=W24>Weinstein (2000), p. 24</ref> The bass plays a "...more important role in heavy metal than in any other genre of rock."<ref>Weinstein (2009), p. 24</ref> Metal basslines vary widely in complexity, from holding down a low [[pedal point]] as a foundation to doubling complex riffs and [[lick (music)|licks]] along with the lead and/or rhythm guitars. Some bands feature the bass as a lead instrument, an approach popularized by Metallica's [[Cliff Burton]] with his heavy emphasis on bass guitar solos and use of chords while playing bass in the early 1980s.<ref>[http://www.bassplayer.com/article/the-king-metal/Feb-05/164 "Cliff Burton's Legendary Career: The King of Metal Bass"]. ''Bass Player'', February 2005. Retrieved on November 13, 2007.</ref>

The essence of metal drumming is creating a loud, constant beat for the band using the "trifecta of speed, power, and precision".<ref>Dawson, Michael. [http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2006/08/chris-adler/ "Lamb of God's Chris Adler: More than Meets the Eye"], August 17, 2006. ''Modern Drummer Online''.

The metal drum setup is generally much larger than those employed in other forms of rock music.<ref name=W24/> Black metal, death metal and some "mainstream metal" bands "...all depend upon [[double bass drumming|double-kicks]] and [[blast beats]]."<ref>{{cite book |last=Cope |first=Andrew L. |date= 2010|title=Black Sabbath and the Rise of Heavy Metal Music |url= |location= |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing Ltd.]] |page=130 |isbn=}}</ref>

In live performance, [[loudness]]—an "onslaught of sound," in sociologist [[Deena Weinstein]]'s description—is considered vital.<ref name=W23/> In his book ''Metalheads'', psychologist Jeffrey Arnett refers to heavy metal concerts as "the sensory equivalent of war."<ref>Arnett (1996), p. 14</ref> Following the lead set by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[The Who]], early heavy metal acts such as [[Blue Cheer]] set new benchmarks for volume.

===Musical language===

====Rhythm and tempo====
[[File:Heavy rythmic pattern2.png|500px|thumb|An example of a rhythmic pattern used in heavy metal. The upper stave is a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] [[rhythm guitar]] part. The lower stave is the drum part.{{Listen

}}]]

The rhythm in metal songs is emphatic, with deliberate stresses. Weinstein observes that the wide array of sonic effects available to metal drummers enables the "rhythmic pattern to take on a complexity within its elemental drive and insistency".<ref name=W24/> In many heavy metal songs, the main groove is characterized by short, two-note or three-note rhythmic figures—generally made up of [[eighth note|8th]] or [[sixteenth note|16th notes]]. These rhythmic figures are usually performed with a [[staccato]] attack created by using a [[palm mute|palm-muted]] technique on the rhythm guitar.<ref>"Master of Rhythm: The Importance of Tone and Right-hand Technique", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 99</ref>

Brief, abrupt, and detached [[rhythmic cell]]s are joined into rhythmic phrases with a distinctive, often jerky texture. These phrases are used to create rhythmic accompaniment and melodic figures called [[riff]]s, which help to establish thematic [[Hook (music)|hooks]]. Heavy metal songs also use longer rhythmic figures such as [[whole note]]- or dotted quarter note-length chords in slow-tempo [[power ballad]]s. The tempos in early heavy metal music tended to be "slow, even ponderous".<ref name=W24/> By the late 1970s, however, metal bands were employing a wide variety of tempos. In the 2000s decade, metal tempos range from slow ballad tempos (quarter note = 60 [[beats per minute]]) to extremely fast [[blast beat]] tempos (quarter note = 350 beats per minute).<ref name=Berry/>

====Harmony====
One of the signatures of the genre is the guitar [[power chord]].<ref>Walser (1993), p. 2</ref> In technical terms, the power chord is relatively simple: it involves just one main [[interval (music)|interval]], generally the [[perfect fifth]], though an [[octave]] may be added as a doubling of the [[Root (chord)|root]]. When power chords are played on the lower strings at high volumes and with distortion, [[Resultant (organ)|additional low frequency sounds]] are created, which add to the "...weight of the sound" and create an effect of "...overwhelming power".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walser |first1=Robert|date=2014|title=Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music|page=43 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}</ref> Although the perfect fifth interval is the most common basis for the power chord,<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.melbay.com/guitarglossary.asp Glossary of Guitar Terms]. Mel Bay Publications. Retrieved on November 15, 2007.</ref> power chords are also based on different intervals such as the [[minor third]], [[major third]], [[perfect fourth]], [[diminished fifth]], or [[minor sixth]].<ref>"Shaping Up and Riffing Out: Using Major and Minor Power Chords to Add Colour to Your Parts", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 97</ref> Most power chords are also played with a consistent finger arrangement that can be slid easily up and down the [[fingerboard|fretboard]].<ref>Schonbrun (2006), p. 22</ref>

====Typical harmonic structures====
Heavy metal is usually based on [[riff]]s created with three main harmonic traits: modal scale progressions, tritone and chromatic progressions, and the use of [[pedal point]]s. Traditional heavy metal tends to employ modal scales, in particular the [[Aeolian mode|Aeolian]] and [[Phrygian mode]]s.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 46</ref> Harmonically speaking, this means the genre typically incorporates modal chord progressions such as the Aeolian progressions I-VI-VII, I-VII-(VI), or I-VI-IV-VII and Phrygian progressions implying the relation between I and ♭II (I-♭II-I, I-♭II-III, or I-♭II-VII for example). Tense-sounding [[chromatic]] or [[tritone]] relationships are used in a number of metal chord progressions.<ref>Marshall, Wolf. "Power Lord—Climbing Chords, Evil Tritones, Giant Callouses", ''Guitar Legends'', April 1997, p. 29</ref><ref name=MH>Dunn, Sam (2005). [http://www.metalhistory.com/ "Metal: A Headbanger's Journey"]. Warner Home Video (2006). Retrieved on March 19, 2007.</ref> In addition to using modal harmonic relationships, heavy metal also uses "...pentatonic and blues-derived features."<ref name="Lilja 2009">{{cite journal |last=Lilja |first=Esa |date=2009 |title=Theory and Analysis of Classic Heavy Metal Harmony |journal=[[Advanced Musicology]] |publisher=IAML Finland |volume=1 |issue= |pages= |doi= }}</ref>

The tritone, an interval spanning three whole tones—such as C and F#—was a forbidden dissonance in medieval ecclesiastical singing, which led monks to call it ''diabolus in musica''—"the devil in music".<ref>The first explicit prohibition of that interval seems to occur with the "development of [[Guido of Arezzo]]'s [[hexachord]]al system which made B flat a [[diatonic]] note, namely as the 4th degree of the hexachordal on F. From then until the end of Renaissance the tritone, nicknamed the 'diabolus in musica', was regarded as an unstable interval and rejected as a consonance" (Sadie, Stanley [1980]. "Tritone", in ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', 1st ed. MacMillan, pp. 154–5. ISBN 0-333-23111-2. See also Arnold, Denis [1983]. "Tritone", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J''. [[Oxford University Press]]. ISBN 0-19-311316-3). During the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] eras, the interval came to be accepted, though in a specific, controlled way. It is only during the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]] and in [[20th century classical music|modern classical music]] that composers have used it freely, exploiting the evil connotations with which it is culturally associated.</ref>

Heavy metal songs often make extensive use of [[pedal point]] as a harmonic basis. A pedal point is a sustained tone, typically in the bass range, during which at least one foreign (i.e., dissonant) harmony is sounded in the other parts.<ref>Kennedy (1985), "Pedal Point", p. 540</ref> According to Robert Walser, heavy metal harmonic relationships are "...often quite complex" and the harmonic analysis done by metal players and teachers is "...often very sophisticated."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walser |first1=Robert|date=2014|title=Running With the Devil: Power, Gender, and Madness in Heavy Metal Music|page=47 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press}}</ref> In the study of heavy metal chord structures, it has been concluded that "...heavy metal music has proved to be far more complicated" than other music researchers had realized.<ref name="Lilja 2009"/>

====Relationship with classical music====
[[File:Ritchie Blackmore 1977.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ritchie Blackmore]], founder of [[Deep Purple]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], known for the neoclassical approach in his guitar performances]]

It has been stated that, alongside blues and R&B, the "assemblage of disparate musical styles known...as '[[classical music]]'" has been a major influence on heavy metal since the genre's earliest days. Also that metal's "most influential musicians have been guitar players who have also studied classical music. Their appropriation and adaptation of classical models sparked the development of a new kind of guitar virtuosity [and] changes in the harmonic and melodic language of heavy metal."<ref>Walser (1993), p. 58</ref>

In an article written for ''[[Grove Music Online]]'', Walser stated that the "1980s brought on ...the widespread adaptation of chord progressions and virtuosic practices from 18th-century European models, especially [[J.S. Bach|Bach]] and [[Antonio Vivaldi]], by influential guitarists such as [[Ritchie Blackmore]], [[Marty Friedman]], [[Jason Becker]], [[Uli Jon Roth]], [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[Randy Rhoads]] and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]".<ref>Walser, Robert. "Heavy metal". ''Grove Music Online''. Accessed March 6, 2010. http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/public/book/omo_gmo (subscription required for access).</ref> Kurt Bachmann of [[Believer (band)|Believer]] has stated that "If done correctly, metal and classical fit quite well together. Classical and metal are probably the two genres that have the most in common when it comes to feel, texture, creativity."<ref>Wagner, Wilson, pg. 156.</ref>

Although a number of metal musicians cite classical composers as inspiration, classical and metal are rooted in different cultural traditions and practices—classical in the [[art music]] tradition, metal in the [[popular music]] tradition. As [[musicologists]] Nicolas Cook and Nicola Dibben note, "Analyses of popular music also sometimes reveal the influence of 'art traditions.' An example is Walser's linkage of heavy metal music with the ideologies and even some of the performance practices of nineteenth-century [[Romanticism]]. However, it would be clearly wrong to claim that traditions such as blues, rock, heavy metal, rap or dance music derive primarily from "art music.'"<ref>See Cook and Dibben (2001), p. 56</ref>

===Lyrical themes===
According to scholars David Hatch and Stephen Millward, Black Sabbath, and the numerous metal bands that they inspired, have concentrated lyrically "on dark and depressing subject matter to an extent hitherto unprecedented in any form of pop music". They take as an example Sabbath's second album ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' (1970), which "included songs dealing with personal trauma—'[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]' and '[[Fairies Wear Boots]]' (which described the unsavoury side effects of drug-taking)—as well as those confronting wider issues, such as the self-explanatory '[[War Pigs]]' and '[[Hand of Doom (Black Sabbath song)|Hand of Doom]].'"<ref>Hatch and Millward (1989), p. 167</ref> Deriving from the genre's roots in blues music, sex is another important topic—a thread running from Led Zeppelin's suggestive lyrics to the more explicit references of glam and nu metal bands.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 36</ref>

[[File:King Diamond live 2006 Moscow 02.jpg|thumb|[[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]], known for writing conceptual lyrics about horror stories]]

The thematic content of heavy metal has long been a target of criticism. According to [[Jon Pareles]], "Heavy metal's main subject matter is simple and virtually universal. With grunts, moans and subliterary lyrics, it celebrates...a party without limits.... [T]he bulk of the music is stylized and formulaic."<ref name=JP/> Music critics have often deemed metal lyrics juvenile and banal, and others<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjRSmEjs8ZcC&pg=PT245 |year=2007|title=The Rock History Reader |author=[[Tipper Gore|Gore, Tipper]]|chapter=The Cult of Violence|editor=Cateforis, Theo |accessdate=2015-08-30|pages=227–233|isbn=0-415-97501-8|publisher=Taylor & Francis}}</ref> have objected to what they see as advocacy of [[misogyny]] and the occult. During the 1980s, the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] petitioned the U.S. Congress to regulate the popular music industry due to what the group asserted were objectionable lyrics, particularly those in heavy metal songs.<ref name="See, e 2006 pp. 104">See, e.g., Ewing and McCann (2006), pp. 104–113</ref> Music critic [[Robert Christgau]] called metal "an expressive mode it sometimes seems will be with us for as long as ordinary white boys fear girls, pity themselves, and are permitted to rage against a world they'll never beat".<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|date=October 13, 1998|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-10-13/music/nothing-s-shocking/1/|title=Nothing's Shocking|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref>

Metal artists have had to defend their lyrics in front of the U.S. Senate and in court. In 1985, [[Twisted Sister]] frontman [[Dee Snider]] was asked to defend his song ''[[Under the Blade (song)|Under the Blade]]'' at a U.S. Senate hearing. At the hearing, the [[PMRC]] alleged that the song was about [[sadomasochism]] and [[rape]]; Snider stated that the song was about his bandmate's throat surgery.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ostroff  |first=Joshua  |date=18 September 2015 |title=Twisted Sister's Dee Snider Blasts Irresponsible Parents On PMRC Hearings' 30th Anniversary |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2015/09/18/dee-snider-twisted-sister-pmrc-senate-hearings_n_8020706.html |journal=Huffington Post |publisher=Huffington Post |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=3 February 2016}}</ref> In 1986, [[Ozzy Osbourne]] was sued because of the lyrics of his song ''[[Suicide Solution]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Elovaara |first=Mika |editor1-last=Abbey |editor1-first=James |editor2-last=Helb |editor2-first=Colin|title=Hardcore, Punk and Other Junk: Aggressive Sounds in Contemporary Music|publisher=Lexington Books|date=2014 |page=38 |chapter=Chapter 3: Am I Evil?

For certain artists and bands, visual imagery plays a large role in heavy metal. In addition to its sound and lyrics, a heavy metal band's "image" is expressed in album sleeve art, logos, stage sets, clothing, and [[music video]]s.<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 27</ref>

Down-the-back long hair is the "most crucial distinguishing feature of metal fashion."<ref>Weinstein (2000), p. 129</ref> Originally adopted from the hippie subculture, by the 1980s and 1990s heavy metal hair "symbolised the hate, angst and disenchantment of a generation that seemingly never felt at home", according to journalist Nader Rahman. Long hair gave members of the metal community "the power they needed to rebel against nothing in general."<ref>Rahman, Nader.

The classic uniform of heavy metal fans consists of light colored, ripped frayed or torn blue jeans, black T-shirts, boots and black leather or jeans jackets....

Fashion and personal style was especially important for glam metal bands of the era. Performers typically wore long, dyed, hairspray-teased hair (hence the nickname, "hair metal"); makeup such as lipstick and eyeliner; gaudy clothing, including leopard-skin-printed shirts or vests and tight denim, leather, or spandex pants; and accessories such as headbands and jewelry.<ref name="Thompson (2007), p. 135"/> Pioneered by the heavy metal act [[X Japan]] in the late 1980s, bands in the Japanese movement known as [[visual kei]]—which includes many nonmetal groups—emphasize elaborate costumes, hair, and makeup.<ref>{{cite web|author=Strauss, Neil|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00EFD7103DF93BA25755C0A96E958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|title=The Pop Life: End of a Life, End of an Era|date=1998-06-18|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-05-09}}</ref>

Attendees of metal concerts do not dance in the usual sense. It has been argued that this is due to the music's largely male audience and "extreme heterosexualist ideology." Two primary body movements that substitute for dancing: headbanging and an arm thrust that is both a sign of appreciation and a rhythmic gesture.<ref>Weinstein, p. 130</ref> The performance of [[air guitar]] is popular among metal fans both at concerts and listening to records at home.<ref>Weinstein, p. 95</ref> Thrash metal concerts have two elements that are not part of the other metal genres: [[moshing]] and [[stage diving]], which "...were imported from the [[punk subculture|punk/hardcore subculture]]." <ref name="Weinstein 2009 228–229">{{cite book |last=Weinstein |first=Deena |date=2009 |title=Heavy Metal:The Music and its Culture |url= |location= |publisher=Da Capo Press|pages=228–229 |isbn=}}</ref> Moshing participants bump and jostle each other as they move in a circle in an area called the "pit" near the stage.

===Fan subculture===
{{Main|Heavy metal subculture}}

It has been argued that heavy metal has outlasted many other rock genres largely due to the emergence of an intense, exclusionary, strongly masculine subculture.<ref>Weinstein, pp. 103, 7, 8, 104</ref> While the metal fan-base is largely young, white, male, and blue-collar, the group is "tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior".<ref>Weinstein, pp. 102, 112</ref> Identification with the subculture is strengthened not only by the group experience of concert-going and shared elements of fashion, but also by contributing to metal magazines and, more recently, websites.<ref>Weinstein, pp. 181, 207, 294</ref>
Attending live concerts in particular has been called the “holiest of heavy metal communions”.<ref>Julian Schaap and Pauwke Berkers. "Grunting Alone? Online Gender Inequality in Extreme Metal Music" in ''Journal of the International Association for the Study of Popular Music''. Vol.4, no.1 (2014) p. 105</ref>

The metal scene has been characterized as a "subculture of alienation", with its own code of authenticity.<ref name=JQS>"Three profiles of heavy metal fans: A taste for sensation and a subculture of alienation", Jeffrey Arnett. In ''Qualitative Sociology''; Publisher Springer Netherlands. ISSN 0162-0436 (Print) 1573–7837 (Online). Volume 16, Number 4 / December 1993. Pages 423–443.</ref> This code puts several demands on performers: they must appear both completely devoted to their music and loyal to the subculture that supports it; they must appear uninterested in mainstream appeal and radio hits; and they must never "[[selling out|sell out]]".<ref>Weinstein, pp. 46, 60, 154, 273</ref> For the fans themselves, the code promotes "opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society".<ref>Weinstein, p. 166</ref>

Musician and filmmaker [[Rob Zombie]] observes, "Most of the kids who come to my shows seem like really imaginative kids with a lot of creative energy they don't know what to do with" and that metal is "outsider music for outsiders. Nobody wants to be the weird kid; you just somehow end up being the weird kid. It's kind of like that, but with metal you have all the weird kids in one place".<ref name="Sam Dunn">Dunn, "Metal: A Headbanger's Journey" B000EGEJIY (2006)</ref> Scholars of metal have noted the tendency of fans to classify and reject some performers (and some other fans) as "[[poseur (music)|poseurs]]" "who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity".<ref name=JQS/><ref>Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen (1996).

==Etymology==
The origin of the term "heavy metal" in a musical context is uncertain. The phrase has been used for centuries in chemistry and metallurgy, where the periodic table organizes elements of both [[light metal|light]] and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] (e.g., uranium). An early use of the term in modern popular culture was by [[counterculture|countercultural]] writer [[William S. Burroughs]]. His 1962 novel ''[[The Soft Machine]]'' includes a character known as "Uranian Willy, the Heavy Metal Kid". Burroughs' next novel, ''[[Nova Express]]'' (1964), develops the theme, using ''heavy metal'' as a metaphor for addictive drugs: "With their diseases and orgasm drugs and their sexless parasite life forms—Heavy Metal People of Uranus wrapped in cool blue mist of vaporized bank notes—And The Insect People of Minraud with metal music".<ref>[[William S. Burroughs|Burroughs, William S]]. [http://www.efn.org/~dredmond/PP3.html "Nova Express"]. New York: Grove Press, 1964. Pg. 112.</ref> Inspired by Burroughs' novels,<ref>{{cite book |last=Thorgerson|first=Storm|date=1999 |title=100 Best Album Covers|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r6hJAQAAIAAJ&q=michael+english+%22named+the+heavy+metal+kids+after+william+burroughs+book%22&dq=michael+english+%22named+the+heavy+metal+kids+after+william+burroughs+book%22&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y |location= |publisher=DK|page=1969 |isbn=}}</ref> the term was used in the title of the 1967 album ''Featuring the Human Host and the Heavy Metal Kids'' by [[Hapshash and the Coloured Coat]], which has been claimed to be its first use in the context of music.<ref>{{cite book |last=Palacios|first=Julian|date=2010 |title=Syd Barrett & Pink Floyd: Dark Globe |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DvgH58uEPFAC&pg=PA170&dq=hapshash+%22heavy+metal%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv1MOiparKAhUG6RQKHZE4DtMQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=hapshash%20%22heavy%20metal%22&f=false |location= |publisher=Plexus |page=170 |isbn=0859654311}}</ref> The phrase was later lifted by [[Sandy Pearlman]], who used the term to describe [[The Byrds]] for their supposed "aluminium style of context and effect", particularly on their album ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'' (1968).<ref name="Dome">{{Cite episode|title=Arena: 'Heavy Metal' |series=Arena (Tv show)|credits=[[Malcolm Dome]]|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|minutes=4:06 – 4:21}}</ref>

Metal historian [[Ian Christe]] describes what the components of the term mean in "hippiespeak": "heavy" is roughly synonymous with "potent" or "profound," and "metal" designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 10</ref> The word "heavy" in this sense was a basic element of [[beatnik]] and later countercultural [[slang]], and references to "heavy music"—typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare—were already common by the mid-1960s. [[Iron Butterfly]]'s debut album, released in early 1968, was titled ''[[Heavy (Iron Butterfly album)|Heavy]]''. The first use of "heavy metal" in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] song "[[Born to Be Wild]]", also released that year:<ref>Walser (1993), p. 8</ref> "I like smoke and lightning/Heavy metal thunder/Racin' with the wind/And the feelin' that I'm under."

The first documented use of the phrase to describe a type of rock music identified to date appears in a review by [[Barry Gifford]]. In the May 11, 1968, issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he wrote about the album ''[[A Long Time Comin']]'' by U.S. band [[Electric Flag]]: "Nobody who's been listening to [[Mike Bloomfield]]—either talking or playing—in the last few years could have expected this. This is the new soul music, the synthesis of white blues and heavy metal rock."<ref>Gifford, Barry. ''Rolling Stone'', May 11, 1968, p. 20.</ref> In January 1970 [[Lucian Truscott IV|Lucian K. Truscott IV]] reviewing ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'' for the [[Village Voice]] described the sound as "heavy" and made comparisons with [[Blue Cheer]] and [[Vanilla Fudge]].<ref>[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/these-led-zeppelin-guys-are-surprisingly-good-6659450 "Riffs"]. [[Lucian Truscott#Family|Lucian K. Truscott IV]] for the [[Village Voice]]. January 22, 1970. "Led Zeppelin, popularly looked on as an English version of Blue Cheer, given to Vanilla Fudgeish heavy-handedness in all that it does, has come out with a good album, 'Led Zeppelin II' (Atlantic SD 8236). Sure, it's 'heavy.' Sure, it's volume-rock at a time when the trend seems to be toward acoustical niceties of country music".</ref>

Other early documented uses of the phrase are from reviews by critic [[Mike Saunders]]. In the November 12, 1970 issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he commented on an album put out the previous year by the British band [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]]: "''[[As Safe as Yesterday Is|Safe as Yesterday Is]],'' their first American release, proved that Humble Pie could be boring in lots of different ways. Here they were a noisy, unmelodic, heavy metal-leaden shit-rock band with the loud and noisy parts beyond doubt. There were a couple of nice songs...and one monumental pile of refuse". He described the band's latest, [[Humble Pie (album)|self-titled release]] as "more of the same 27th-rate heavy metal crap".<ref>{{cite web |author=Saunders, Mike |date=1970-11-12 |title=Humble Pie: 'Town and Country' (review) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130055912/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/158628/review/5944670/town_and_country |work=Rolling Stone |deadurl=yes |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/humblepie/albums/album/158628/review/5944670/town_and_country |archivedate=November 30, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-17}}</ref>

In a review of [[Sir Lord Baltimore]]'s ''[[Kingdom Come (Sir Lord Baltimore album)|Kingdom Come]]'' in the May 1971 ''[[Creem]]'', Saunders wrote, "Sir Lord Baltimore seems to have down pat most all the best heavy metal tricks in the book".<ref>{{cite web|author=Saunders, Mike |date=May 1971 |url=http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/SirLordBaltimore/KingdomCome001.html |title=Sir Lord Baltimore's 'Kingdom Come' (review) |work=Creem |accessdate=2007-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070308145737/http://www.creemmagazine.com:80/_site/BeatGoesOn/SirLordBaltimore/KingdomCome001.html |archivedate=March 8, 2007 }}</ref> ''[[Creem]]'' critic [[Lester Bangs]] is credited with popularizing the term via his early 1970s essays on bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 19</ref> Through the decade, ''heavy metal'' was used by certain critics as a virtually automatic putdown. In 1979, lead ''New York Times'' popular music critic [[John Rockwell]] described what he called "heavy-metal rock" as "brutally aggressive music played mostly for minds clouded by drugs",<ref>Rockwell, John. ''New York Times'', February 4, 1979, p. D22</ref> and, in a different article, as "a crude exaggeration of rock basics that appeals to white teenagers".<ref>Rockwell, John. ''New York Times'', August 13, 1979, p. C16</ref>

Coined by [[Black Sabbath]] drummer, [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]], "downer rock" was one of the earliest terms used to describe this style of music and was applied to acts such as Sabbath and [[Bloodrock]]. ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine described the downer rock culture revolving around the use of [[Quaaludes]] and the drinking of wine.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Lost Pioneers of Heavy Metal |last=Sleazegrinder |magazine=Classic Rock |date=March 2007}}</ref> Later the term would be replaced by "heavy metal".<ref>Kevin Holm-Hudson, ''Progressive Rock Reconsidered'', (Routledge, 2002), ISBN 0-8153-3715-9</ref>

The terms "heavy metal" and "[[hard rock]]" have often been used interchangeably, particularly in discussing bands of the 1970s, a period when the terms were largely synonymous.<ref>Du Noyer (2003), pp. 96, 78</ref> For example, the 1983 ''Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll'' includes this passage: "known for its aggressive blues-based hard-rock style, [[Aerosmith]] was the top American heavy-metal band of the mid-Seventies".<ref>Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 4</ref>

==History==

===Antecedents: 1950s to mid-1960s===
Heavy metal's quintessential guitar style, built around distortion-heavy riffs and power chords, traces its roots to early 1950s [[Memphis blues]] [[guitarist]]s such as [[Joe Hill Louis]], [[Willie Johnson (guitarist)|Willie Johnson]], and particularly [[Pat Hare]],<ref name=rolling_memphis>{{cite book |last=Miller |first=Jim |title=The Rolling Stone illustrated history of rock & roll |year=1980 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |location=New York |isbn=0-394-51322-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ZEUAQAAIAAJ |accessdate=5 July 2012 |quote=Black country bluesmen made raw, heavily amplified boogie records of their own, especially in Memphis, where guitarists like Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson (with the early Howlin' Wolf band) and Pat Hare (with Little Junior Parker) played driving rhythms and scorching, distorted solos that might be counted the distant ancestors of heavy metal.}}</ref><ref name=palmer/> who captured a "grittier, nastier, more ferocious electric guitar sound" on records such as [[James Cotton]]'s "[[:File:James Cotton - Cotton Crop Blues.ogg|Cotton Crop Blues]]" (1954);<ref name=palmer>[[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]], "Church of the Sonic Guitar", pp.&nbsp;13–38 in Anthony DeCurtis, ''Present Tense'', [[Duke University Press]], 1992, pp.&nbsp;24–27.

[[File:Cream on Fanclub 1968.png|thumb|right|Cream performing on the Dutch television program Fanclub in 1968]]

However, the genre's direct lineage begins in the mid-1960s. American blues music was a major influence on the early [[British rock]]ers of the era. Bands like [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[The Yardbirds]] developed [[blues rock]] by recording covers of many classic blues songs, often speeding up the [[tempo]]s. As they experimented with the music, the UK blues-based bands—and the U.S. acts they influenced in turn—developed what would become the hallmarks of heavy metal, in particular, the loud, distorted guitar sound.<ref name=vdqxbw/> [[The Kinks]] played a major role in popularising this sound with their 1964 hit "[[You Really Got Me]]".<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 18; Walser (1993), p. 9</ref>

In addition to The Kinks' [[Dave Davies]], other guitarists such as [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] and The Yardbirds' [[Jeff Beck]] were experimenting with feedback.<ref>Wilkerson (2006), p. 19.</ref><ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=the-yardbirds-mn0000489303|pure_url=yes}} "The Yardbirds"]. Richie Unterberger. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved 30 August 2011.</ref> Where the blues rock drumming style started out largely as simple shuffle beats on small kits, drummers began using a more muscular, complex, and amplified approach to match and be heard against the increasingly loud guitar.<ref name=eyaqji>Walser (1993), p. 10</ref> Vocalists similarly modified their technique and increased their reliance on amplification, often becoming more stylized and dramatic. In terms of sheer volume, especially in live performance, The Who's "bigger-louder-wall-of-[[Marshall Amplification#Marshall Stack|Marshalls]]" approach was seminal.<ref>McMichael (2004), p. 112</ref>

The combination of blues rock with [[psychedelic rock]] formed much of the original basis for heavy metal.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 16</ref> One of the most influential bands in forging the merger of genres was the British power trio [[Cream (band)|Cream]], who derived a massive, heavy sound from [[unison]] riffing between guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] and bassist [[Jack Bruce]], as well as [[Ginger Baker]]'s double bass drumming.<ref>Charlton (2003), pp. 232–33</ref> Their first two LPs, ''[[Fresh Cream]]'' (1966) and ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' (1967), are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style. [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]]'s debut album, ''[[Are You Experienced (album)|Are You Experienced]]'' (1967), was also highly influential. [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]]'s virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists and the album's most successful single, "[[Purple Haze]]", is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit.<ref name=vdqxbw/>

During the late sixties, many psychedelic singers such as [[Arthur Brown (musician)|Arthur Brown]], began to create outlandish, theatrical and often macabre performances; which in itself became incredibly influential to many metal acts.<ref>{{cite web |author=Unterberger, Ritchie |title=Arthur Brown (Biography) |publisher=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=arthur-brown-mn0000510278|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>Polly Marshall, ''The God of Hellfire, the Crazy Life and Times of Arthur Brown'', ISBN 0-946719-77-2, SAF Publishing, 2005, page 175.</ref><ref>Polly Marshall, ''The God of Hellfire, the Crazy Life and Times of Arthur Brown'', ISBN 0-946719-77-2, SAF Publishing, 2005, page 103.</ref> [[Vanilla Fudge]], whose [[Vanilla Fudge (album)|first album]] also came out in 1967, has been called "one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal".<ref>{{cite web |author=Huey, Steve |title=Vanilla Fudge (Biography) |publisher=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=vanilla-fudge-mn0000311674|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref>

Critics disagree over who can be thought of as the first heavy metal band. Most credit either [[Led Zeppelin]] or [[Black Sabbath]], with American commentators tending to favour Led Zeppelin and British commentators tending to favour Black Sabbath, though many give equal credit to both. A few commentators—mainly American—argue for other groups including [[Iron Butterfly]], [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] or [[Blue Cheer]].<ref>Weinstein (2000), pp.&nbsp;14–15.</ref>

In 1968, the sound that would become known as heavy metal began to coalesce. That January, the San Francisco band [[Blue Cheer]] released a cover of [[Eddie Cochran]]'s classic "[[Summertime Blues]]", from their debut album ''[[Vincebus Eruptum]]'', that many consider the first true heavy metal recording.<ref>McCleary (2004), pp. 240, 506.</ref> The same month, [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] released its [[steppenwolf (Steppenwolf album)|self-titled debut album]], including "[[Born to Be Wild]]", which refers to "heavy metal thunder" in describing a motorcycle.

In January 1969, Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released and reached number 10 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' album chart. In July, Zeppelin and a power trio with a Cream-inspired, but cruder sound, [[Grand Funk Railroad]], played the [[Atlanta International Pop Festival (1969)|Atlanta Pop Festival]]. That same month, another Cream-rooted trio led by [[Leslie West]] released ''[[Mountain (Leslie West album)|Mountain]]'', an album filled with heavy blues rock guitar and roaring vocals. In August, the group—now itself dubbed [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]]—played an hour-long set at the [[Woodstock Festival]].<ref>Though often identified now as "hard rock", the band's official debut album, ''Mountain Climbing'' (1970), placed 85th on the list of "Top 100 Metal Albums" compiled by ''[[Hit Parader]]'' in 1989. In November, [[Love Sculpture]], with guitarist [[Dave Edmunds]], put out ''Forms and Feelings'', featuring a pounding, aggressive version of [[Khachaturian]]'s "[[Sabre Dance]]". Grand Funk Railroad's ''Survival'' (1971) placed 72nd (Walser [1993], p. 174).</ref>

Led Zeppelin defined central aspects of the emerging genre, with Page's highly distorted guitar style and singer [[Robert Plant]]'s dramatic, wailing vocals.<ref>Charlton (2003), p. 239</ref> Other bands, with a more consistently heavy, "purely" metal sound, would prove equally important in codifying the genre. The 1970 releases by [[Black Sabbath]] (''[[Black Sabbath (album)|Black Sabbath]]'' and ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'') and [[Deep Purple]] (''[[In Rock (Deep Purple album)|In Rock]]'') were crucial in this regard.<ref name=eyaqji/>

Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to an industrial accident guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] suffered before cofounding the band. Unable to play normally, Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering.<ref>di Perna, Alan.

On the other side of the Atlantic, the trend-setting group was [[Grand Funk Railroad]], described as "the most commercially successful American heavy-metal band from 1970 until they disbanded in 1976, [they] established the Seventies success formula: continuous touring".<ref>Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 225</ref> Other bands identified with metal emerged in the U.S., such as [[Blue Öyster Cult]] ([[Blue Öyster Cult (album)|1972]]), [[Aerosmith]] ([[Aerosmith (album)|1973]]) and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] ([[Kiss (Kiss album)|1974]]). In Germany, [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] debuted with ''[[Lonesome Crow]]'' in 1972. Blackmore, who had emerged as a virtuoso soloist with Deep Purple's ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'' (1972), quit the group in 1975 to form [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]. These bands also built audiences via constant touring and increasingly elaborate stage shows.<ref name=eyaqji/>

As described above, there are arguments about whether these and other early bands truly qualify as "heavy metal" or simply as "hard rock". Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. [[AC/DC]], which debuted with ''[[High Voltage (Australian album)|High Voltage]]'' in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 ''Rolling Stone'' encyclopedia entry begins, "Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC".<ref>Pareles and Romanowski (1983), p. 1</ref> Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, "Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today.... [They] were a rock 'n' roll band that just happened to be heavy enough for metal".<ref>Walker (2001), p. 297</ref> The issue is not only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band "became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition".<ref>Christe (2003), p. 54</ref>

In certain cases, there is little debate. After Black Sabbath, the next major example is Britain's [[Judas Priest]], which debuted with ''[[Rocka Rolla]]'' in 1974. In Christe's description,
<blockquote>
"Black Sabbath's audience was...left to scavenge for sounds with similar impact. By the mid-1970s, heavy metal aesthetic could be spotted, like a mythical beast, in the moody bass and complex dual guitars of [[Thin Lizzy]], in the stagecraft of [[Alice Cooper]], in the sizzling guitar and showy vocals of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and in the thundering medieval questions of Rainbow.... Judas Priest arrived to unify and amplify these diverse highlights from hard rock's sonic palette. For the first time, heavy metal became a true genre unto itself."<ref>Christe (2003), pp. 19–20</ref>
</blockquote>
Though Judas Priest did not have a top 40 album in the United States until 1980, for many it was the definitive post-Sabbath heavy metal band; its twin-guitar attack, featuring rapid tempos and a non-[[blues]]y, more cleanly metallic sound, was a major influence on later acts.<ref name="Walser 1993, p. 6"/> While heavy metal was growing in popularity, most critics were not enamored of the music. Objections were raised to metal's adoption of visual spectacle and other trappings of commercial artifice,<ref name=gnwtey>Walser (1993), p. 11</ref> but the main offense was its perceived musical and lyrical vacuity: reviewing a Black Sabbath album in the early 1970s, leading critic [[Robert Christgau]] described it as "dull and decadent...dim-witted, amoral exploitation."<ref>Christgau (1981), p. 49</ref>

===Mainstream: late 1970s and 1980s===
[[File:Iron Maiden - bass and guitars 30nov2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Iron Maiden]], one of the central bands in the [[new wave of British heavy metal]]]]

[[Punk rock]] emerged in the mid-1970s as a reaction against contemporary social conditions as well as what was perceived as the overindulgent, overproduced rock music of the time, including heavy metal. Sales of heavy metal records declined sharply in the late 1970s in the face of punk, [[disco]], and more mainstream rock.<ref name=gnwtey/> With the major labels fixated on punk, many newer British heavy metal bands were inspired by the movement's aggressive, high-energy sound and "[[low fidelity|lo-fi]]", [[do it yourself]] ethos. Underground metal bands began putting out cheaply recorded releases independently to small, devoted audiences.<ref>Christe (2003), pp. 30, 33</ref>

[[Motörhead]], founded in 1975, was the first important band to straddle the punk/metal divide. With the explosion of punk in 1977, others followed. British music papers such as the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' took notice, with ''Sounds'' writer Geoff Barton christening the movement the "New Wave of British Heavy Metal".<ref>Christe (2003), p. 33</ref> NWOBHM bands including [[Iron Maiden]], [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]], and [[Def Leppard]] reenergized the heavy metal genre. Following the lead set by Judas Priest and Motörhead, they toughened up the sound, reduced its blues elements, and emphasized increasingly fast tempos.<ref>{{cite web |title=Judas Priest |author1=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas  |author2=Prato, Greg |publisher=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=judas-priest-mn0000246611|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2007-04-30}} {{cite web |title=Genre—New Wave of British Heavy Metal |publisher=Allmusic |url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=new-wave-of-british-heavy-metal-ma0000004491|pure_url=yes}} |accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref>

By 1980, the NWOBHM had broken into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, other NWOBHM bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Diamond Head (band)|Diamond Head]] would have a significant influence on metal's development.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 44</ref> In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with ''[[No Sleep 'til Hammersmith]]''.

The first generation of metal bands was ceding the limelight. Deep Purple had broken up soon after Blackmore's departure in 1975, and Led Zeppelin broke up following drummer [[John Bonham]]'s death in 1980. Black Sabbath plagued with infighting and substance abuse, while facing fierce competition with their opening band, the [[Los Angeles]] band [[Van Halen]].<ref>Popoff (2011), ''Black Sabbath FAQ: All That's Left to Know on the First Name in Metal'' P. 130</ref><ref>Christe (2003), p. 25</ref> [[Eddie Van Halen]] established himself as one of the leading metal guitarists of the era. His solo on "[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]", from the band's [[Van Halen (album)|self-titled 1978 album]], is considered a milestone.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 51</ref> [[Van Halen]]'s sound even crossed over into pop music when he was featured on the track "[[Beat It]]" by [[Michael Jackson]] (a US number 1 in February 1983).<ref>"Van Halen - Van Halen." Encyclopedia of Popular Music, 4th ed. Ed. Colin Larkin. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 4 Oct. 2015.</ref>

Inspired by Van Halen's success, a metal scene began to develop in Southern California during the late 1970s. Based on the clubs of L.A.'s [[Sunset Strip]], bands such as [[Quiet Riot]], [[Ratt]], [[Mötley Crüe]], and [[W.A.S.P.]] were influenced by traditional heavy metal of the earlier 1970s.<ref>Rivadavia, Eduardo.

In the wake of the new wave of British heavy metal and Judas Priest's breakthrough ''[[British Steel (album)|British Steel]]'' (1980), heavy metal became increasingly popular in the early 1980s. Many metal artists benefited from the exposure they received on [[MTV]], which began airing in 1981—sales often soared if a band's videos screened on the channel.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 79</ref> Def Leppard's videos for ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]'' (1983) made them superstars in America and Quiet Riot became the first domestic heavy metal band to top the ''Billboard'' chart with ''[[Metal Health]]'' (1983). One of the seminal events in metal's growing popularity was the 1983 [[US Festival]] in California, where the "heavy metal day" featuring Ozzy Osbourne, Van Halen, Scorpions, Mötley Crüe, Judas Priest, and others drew the largest audiences of the three-day event.<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 45</ref>

Between 1983 and 1984, heavy metal went from an 8 percent to a 20 percent share of all recordings sold in the U.S.<ref>Walser (1993), p. 12</ref> Several major professional magazines devoted to the genre were launched, including ''[[Kerrang!]]'' (in 1981) and ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' (in 1984), as well as a host of fan journals. In 1985, ''Billboard'' declared, "Metal has broadened its audience base. Metal music is no longer the exclusive domain of male teenagers. The metal audience has become older (college-aged), younger (pre-teen), and more female".<ref>Walser (1993), pp. 12–13, 182 n. 35</ref>

By the mid-1980s, glam metal was a dominant presence on the U.S. charts, [[music television]], and the arena concert circuit. New bands such as L.A.'s [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]] and acts from the East Coast like [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] and [[Cinderella (band)|Cinderella]] became major draws, while Mötley Crüe and Ratt remained very popular. Bridging the stylistic gap between hard rock and glam metal, [[New Jersey]]'s [[Bon Jovi]] became enormously successful with its third album, ''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' (1986). The similarly styled Swedish band [[Europe (band)|Europe]] became international stars with ''[[The Final Countdown (album)|The Final Countdown]]'' (1986). Its [[The Final Countdown (song)|title track]] hit number 1 in 25 countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rock Group Europe Plan Comeback |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-03 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3162506.stm |accessdate=2008-11-28 |location=London}}</ref> In 1987, MTV launched a show, ''[[Headbanger's Ball]]'', devoted exclusively to heavy metal videos. However, the metal audience had begun to factionalize, with those in many underground metal scenes favoring more extreme sounds and disparaging the popular style as "light metal" or "hair metal".<ref>Walser (1993), p. 14; Christe (2003), p. 170</ref>

One band that reached diverse audiences was [[Guns N' Roses]]. In contrast to their glam metal contemporaries in L.A., they were seen as much more raw and dangerous. With the release of their chart-topping ''[[Appetite for Destruction]]'' (1987), they "recharged and almost single-handedly sustained the Sunset Strip sleaze system for several years".<ref>Christe (2003), p. 165</ref> The following year, [[Jane's Addiction]] emerged from the same L.A. hard-rock club scene with its major label debut, ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]''. Reviewing the album, ''Rolling Stone'' declared, "as much as any band in existence, Jane's Addiction is the true heir to Led Zeppelin".<ref>{{cite web |title=Jane's Addiction: ''Nothing's Shocking'' |author=Steve Pond |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1988-10-20 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/janesaddiction/albums/album/119704/review/5942383/nothings_shocking |accessdate=2007-05-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002080218/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/janesaddiction/albums/album/119704/review/5942383/nothings_shocking |archivedate=October 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}</ref> The group was one of the first to be identified with the "[[alternative metal]]" trend that would come to the fore in the next decade. Meanwhile, new bands such as New York's [[Winger (band)|Winger]] and New Jersey's [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] sustained the popularity of the glam metal style.<ref name=Covach>Covach, John.

===Other metal genres: 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s===
Many [[list of heavy metal genres|subgenres of heavy metal]] developed outside of the commercial mainstream during the 1980s<ref>Weinstein (1991), p. 21</ref> such as [[crossover thrash]]. Several attempts have been made to map the complex world of underground metal, most notably by the editors of [[AllMusic]], as well as critic [[Rockdetector|Garry Sharpe-Young]]. Sharpe-Young's multivolume metal encyclopedia separates the underground into five major categories: [[thrash metal]], [[death metal]], [[black metal]], [[power metal]], and the related subgenres of [[doom metal|doom]] and [[gothic metal]].<ref>Sharpe-Young (2007), p. 2</ref>

In 1990, a review in ''Rolling Stone'' suggested retiring the term "heavy metal" as the genre was "ridiculously vague".<ref name="rs-1990">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108121842/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/anthrax/albums/album/302316/review/5946559/persistence_of_time|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/anthrax/albums/album/302316/review/5946559/persistence_of_time|accessdate=July 17, 2015|archivedate=January 8, 2008|title=Anthrax: Persistence of Time|last=Neely|first=Kim|date=October 4, 1990|work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The article stated that the term only fueled "misperceptions of rock & roll bigots who still assume that five bands as different as [[Ratt]], [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Danzig]] and [[Mother Love Bone]]" sound the same.<ref name="rs-1990" />

Thrash metal emerged in the early 1980s under the influence of [[hardcore punk]] and the new wave of British heavy metal,<ref name=GTM>[{{Allmusic|class=style|id=speed-thrash-metal-ma0000002874|pure_url=yes}} "Genre—Thrash Metal"].

The movement began in the United States, with [[Bay Area thrash metal]] being the leading scene. The sound developed by thrash groups was faster and more aggressive than that of the original metal bands and their glam metal successors.<ref name=GTM/> Low-register guitar riffs are typically overlaid with [[shred guitar|shredding]] leads. Lyrics often express [[nihilism|nihilistic]] views or deal with [[social issues]] using visceral, gory language.

The subgenre was popularized by the "Big Four of Thrash": [[Metallica]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Megadeth]], and [[Slayer]].<ref>Walser (1993), p.14</ref> Three German bands, [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]], and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], played a central role in bringing the style to Europe. Others, including San Francisco Bay Area's [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]], New Jersey's [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]], and Brazil's [[Sepultura]] and [[Sarcófago]], also had a significant impact. Although thrash began as an underground movement, and remained largely that for almost a decade, the leading bands of the scene began to reach a wider audience. Metallica brought the sound into the top 40 of the ''Billboard'' album chart in 1986 with ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', the genre's first platinum record.<ref>Nicholls (1997), p. 378</ref> Two years later, the band's ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' hit number 6, while Megadeth and Anthrax also had top 40 records on the American charts.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=metallica|chart=all}} "Metallica—Artist Chart History"]; [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=megadeth|chart=all}} "Megadeth—Artist Chart History"]; [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=anthrax|chart=all}} "Anthrax—Artist Chart History"].

Though less commercially successful than the rest of the Big Four, Slayer released one of the genre's definitive records: ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' (1986) was credited for incorporating heavier guitar [[timbre]]s, and for including explicit depictions of death, suffering, violence and occult into thrash metal's lyricism.<ref>Phillipov (2012), p. 15, 16</ref> Slayer attracted a following among [[white power skinhead|far-right skinheads]], and accusations of promoting violence and [[Nazism|Nazi]] themes have dogged the band.<ref>Moynihan, Søderlind (1998), p. 30; O'Neil (2001), p. 164</ref> Even though Slayer did not receive substantial media exposure, their music played a key role in the development of [[extreme metal]].<ref>Harrison (2011), p. 61</ref>

Thrash soon began to evolve and split into more extreme metal genres. "Slayer's music was directly responsible for the rise of death metal," according to MTV News.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index7.jhtml The Greatest Metal Bands of All Time—Slayer] {{wayback|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/m/metal/greatest_metal_bands/071406/index7.jhtml |date=20060718000000 }}. MTVNews.com. Retrieved on February 27, 2008.</ref> The NWOBHM band Venom was also an important progenitor. The death metal movement in both North America and Europe adopted and emphasized the elements of [[blasphemy]] and [[diabolism]] employed by such acts. Florida's [[Death (metal band)|Death]] and the Bay Area's [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]] are recognized as seminal bands in the style. Both groups have been credited with inspiring the subgenre's name, the latter via its 1984 demo ''Death Metal'' and the song "Death Metal", from its 1985 debut album ''[[Seven Churches (album)|Seven Churches]]'' (1985). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Swedish death metal became notable and melodic forms of death metal were created.<ref>Ekeroth, Daniel (2011).</ref>

====Black metal====
{{Details|black metal}}

The first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s, led by Britain's [[Venom (band)|Venom]], Denmark's [[Mercyful Fate]], Switzerland's [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]], and Sweden's [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. By the late 1980s, Norwegian bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and [[Burzum]] were heading a second wave.<ref>Christe (2003), p. 270</ref> Black metal varies considerably in style and production quality, although most bands emphasize shrieked and growled vocals, highly distorted guitars frequently played with rapid [[tremolo picking]], a "dark" atmosphere<ref name="Genre—Death Metal/Black Metal"/> and intentionally [[lo-fi]] production, with ambient noise and background hiss.<ref>Jurek, Thom. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=nefaria-mw0000567088|pure_url=yes}} "Striborg: ''Nefaria''"]. Allmusic. Retrieved on November 15, 2007</ref>

Satanic themes are common in black metal, though many bands take inspiration from ancient [[paganism]], promoting a return to supposed pre-Christian values.<ref>Moynihan, Søderlind (1998), p. 212</ref> Numerous black metal bands also "experiment with sounds from all possible forms of metal, folk, classical music, electronica and avant-garde".<ref name=VS/> [[Darkthrone]] drummer [[Fenriz]] explains, "It had something to do with production, lyrics, the way they dressed and a commitment to making ugly, raw, grim stuff.

By 1990, Mayhem was regularly wearing [[corpsepaint]]; many other black metal acts also adopted the look. Bathory inspired the [[Viking metal]] and [[folk metal]] movements and [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] brought blast beats to the fore. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s,<ref>Christe (2003), p. 276</ref> with Mayhem and Burzum linked to church burnings. Growing commercial hype around death metal generated a backlash; beginning in Norway, much of the Scandinavian metal underground shifted to support a black metal scene that resisted being co-opted by the commercial metal industry.<ref>Moynihan, Søderlind (1998), pp. 31–32</ref> According to former [[Gorgoroth]] vocalist [[Gaahl]], "Black Metal was never meant to reach an audience.... [We] had a common enemy which was, of course, Christianity, socialism and everything that democracy stands for."<ref name=Campion/>

Closely related to power metal is [[progressive metal]], which adopts the complex compositional approach of bands like [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[King Crimson]].
