==Etymology==
[[File:Western Haifa from the air.jpg|thumb|Western Haifa from the air]]
The earliest named settlement within the domain of modern-day Haifa was a city known as ''[[Sycamine|Sycaminum]]''.<ref name=Dumperp159/> [[Tel Shikmona]] <ref name=Sharon/> Hebrew meaning "mound of the [[Ficus sycomorus]]" ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''Tell el-Semak'' or ''Tell es-Samak'', meaning "mound of the fish") preserved and transformed this ancient name and is mentioned once in the [[Mishnah]] (composed c. 200 CE) for the wild fruits that grow around it.,<ref name=Sharon/> with locals using it to refer to a coastal [[tell]] at the foot of the Carmel Mountains that contains its remains.<ref name=Sharon>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1d8xHcor0psC&pg=PA99&dq=eusebius+haifa#v=onepage&q=eusebius%20haifa&f=false|pages=99–103|title=Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae addendum: squeezes in the Max van Berchem collection (Palestine, Trans-Jordan, Northern Syria)|edition=Illustrated|publisher=BRILL|year=2007|isbn= 9789004157804|accessdate=2 July 2011|author1=Moshe Sharon |author2=Fondation Max van Berchem }}</ref><ref name=PEF1875/>

''Hefa'' or ''Hepha'' in [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]'s 4th-century work, ''Onomasticon'' (''Onom.'' 108, 31), is said to be another name for ''Sycaminus''.<ref name=Negev>{{cite book|pages=213–214|url=https://books.google.com/?id=27nq65cZUIgC&pg=PA213&dq=hefa+ancient#v=onepage&q=hefa%20ancient&f=false|title=Archaeological encyclopedia of the Holy Land|first1=Avraham |last1=Negev |first2=Shimon |last2=Gibson|edition=4th, revised, illustrated|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=2005|isbn= 9780826485717}}</ref> This synonymizing of the names is explained by [[Moshe Sharon]] who writes that the twin ancient settlements, which he calls ''Haifa-Sycaminon'', gradually expanded into one another, becoming a twin city known by the Greek names ''Sycaminon'' or ''Sycaminos Polis''.<ref name=Sharon/> References to this city end with the Byzantine period.<ref name="autogenerated3"/>

===Early history===
A small port city known today as [[Tell Abu Hawam]] was established [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] (14th century BCE).<ref name="autogenerated3"/> During the 6th century BCE, Greek geographer [[Scylax of Caryanda|Scylax]] told of a city "between the bay and the Promontory of Zeus" (i.e., the Carmel) which may be a reference to [[Shikmona]], a locality in the Haifa area, during the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] period.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> By [[Ancient Greece|Hellenistic]] times, the city had moved to a new site south of what is now [[Bat Galim]] because the port's harbour had become blocked with sand.<ref name="autogenerated3"/> About the 3rd century CE, the city was first mentioned in [[Talmud]]ic literature, as a Jewish fishing village and the home of Rabbi [[Avdimi of Haifa|Avdimi]] and other Jewish scholars.<ref name="autogenerated3"/><ref name="JVL">{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/viehaifa.html |title=Haifa |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |accessdate=20 January 2008}}</ref> A [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking population living along the coast at this time was engaged in commerce.<ref>''Haifa,'' The Guide to Israel, Zev Vilnay, Jerusalem, 1970, p.382</ref>

Haifa was located near the town of [[Shikmona]], a center for making the traditional [[Tzitzit#Tekhelet|Tekhelet]] dye used in the garments of the high priests in the Temple.

Albert of Aachen does not mention the date in a clear manner either. From what he says, it appears that it was mainly the Jewish inhabitants of the city who defended the fortress of Haifa. In his rather strange Latin style, he mentions that there was a Jewish population in Haifa, and that they fought bravely on the walls of the city. He explains that the Jews there were protected people of the Muslims (the Fatimids). They fought side by side with units of the Fatimid army, striking back at Tancred's army from above the walls of the citadel (... ''Judaei civis comixtis Sarracenorum turmis'') until the Crusaders overcame them and they were forced to abandon the walls. The Muslims and the Jews then managed to escape from the fortress with their lives, while the rest of the population fled the city ''en masse''. Whoever remained was slaughtered, and huge quantities of spoils were taken.

[[File:Haifa 6801-11.jpg|thumb|[[Shrine of the Báb]] and the [[Bahá'í gardens]] on [[Mount Carmel]]]]
In 1909, Haifa became important to the [[Bahá'í Faith]] when the remains of the [[Báb]], founder of the Bábí Faith and forerunner of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] in the Bahá'í Faith, were moved from [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] to Haifa and [[Shrine of the Báb|interred in the shrine]] built on [[Mount Carmel]]. Bahá'ís consider the shrine to be their second holiest place on Earth after the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]] in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. Its precise location on Mount Carmel was shown by Bahá'u'lláh himself to his eldest son, [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], in 1891. `Abdu'l-Bahá planned the structure, which was designed and completed several years later by his grandson, [[Shoghi Effendi]]. In a separate room, the [[Shrine of `Abdu'l-Bahá|remains of `Abdu'l-Bahá]] were buried in November 1921.<ref>{{cite news | title=Golden anniversary of the Queen of Carmel | url=http://news.bahai.org/story/252 | publisher=Bahá'í World News Service. | date=12 October 2003 | accessdate=12 May 2007}}</ref>

A branch of the [[Hejaz Railway|Hejaz railway]], known as the [[Jezreel Valley railway]], was built between 1903 and 1905.

[[File:Haifa Refinery by David Shankbone.jpg|left|thumb|[[Oil Refineries|Haifa Oil Refinery]]]]
Haifa's development owed much to British plans to make it a central port and hub for Middle-East crude oil. The British Government of Palestine developed the port and built refineries, thereby facilitating the rapid development of the city as a center for the country's heavy industries. Haifa was also among the first towns to be fully electrified. The Palestine Electric Company inaugurated the Haifa Electrical Power Station already in 1925, opening the door to considerable industrialization.<ref>Shamir, Ronen (2013) Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine.

[[British Armed Forces|British forces]] in Haifa redeployed on 21 April 1948, withdrawing from most of the city while still maintaining control over the port facilities. Two days later the downtown, controlled by a combination of local and foreign (ALA) Arab irregulars was assaulted by [[Yishuv|Jewish]] forces in [[Battle of Haifa (1948)|Operation Bi'ur Hametz]], by the [[Barak Armored Brigade|Carmeli Brigade]] of the [[Haganah]], commanded by [[Moshe Carmel]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The operation led to a massive [[1948 Palestinian exodus|displacement]] of Haifa's Arab population. According to ''The Economist'' at the time, only 5,000–6,000 of the city's 62,000 Arabs remained there by 2 October 1948.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/refugees1.htm |title=The Palestine Refugee Problem |publisher=Mideastweb.org |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>

Contemporaneous sources emphasized the Jewish leadership's attempt to stop the Arab exodus from the city and the Arab leadership as a motivating factor in the refugees' flight.

:''The mass evacuation, prompted partly by fear, partly by orders of Arab leaders, left the Arab quarter of Haifa a ghost city ... By withdrawing Arab workers their leaders hoped to paralyze Haifa.''
[[Benny Morris]] said Haifa's Arabs left due to of a combination of Zionist threats and encouragement to do so by Arab leaders. [[Ilan Pappé]] writes that the shelling culminated in an attack on a Palestinian crowd in the old marketplace using three-inch (76&nbsp;mm) mortars on 22 April 1948.<ref>Pappé, Ilan (1992).

===State of Israel===
{{Further|Declaration of Independence (Israel)}}
After the [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel]] on 14 May 1948 Haifa became the gateway for Jewish immigration into Israel. During the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish immigrants were settled in new neighborhoods, among them [[Kiryat Haim|Kiryat Hayim]], Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and [[Kiryat Eliezer, Haifa|Kiryat Eliezer]]. Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in [[Hadar HaCarmel|Hadar Hacarmel]] date from this period. In 1953, a master plan was created for transportation and the future architectural layout.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web|title=History since Independence |accessdate=9 April 2008 |url=http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/36/c2 |publisher=Haifa Municipality}}</ref>

[[Tel Aviv]] gained in status, while Haifa suffered a decline in the role as regional capital. The opening of [[Ashdod]] as a port exacerbated this. Tourism shrank when the Israeli Ministry of Tourism placed emphasis on developing [[Tiberias]] as a tourist centre.<ref>Kellerman, Aharon (1993) Society and Settlement: Jewish [[Land of Israel]] in the Twentieth Century SUNY Press, ISBN 0-7914-1295-4 p 236</ref>

Nevertheless, Haifa's population had reached 200,000 by the early 1970s, and mass immigration from the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]] boosted the population by a further 35,000.<ref name="modern"/>

Haifa is Israel's third-largest city, consisting of 103,000 households,<ref name="pop"/> or a population of 266,300. Immigrants from the former [[Soviet Union]] constitute 25% of Haifa's population.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/statistical/arab_pop03e.pdf |title=The Arab Population of Israel 2003 |accessdate=3 January 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] }}</ref> According to the [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics|Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics]], [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arabs]] constitute 10% of Haifa's population, the majority living in [[Wadi Nisnas]], Abbas and Halissa neighborhoods.<ref name="autogenerated2"/>

Haifa is commonly portrayed as a model of co-existence between Arabs and Jews, although tensions and hostility do still exist.<ref>Faier, Elizabeth (2005) ''Organizations, Gender, and the Culture of Palestinian Activism in Haifa, Israel: fieldwork and Palestinians in Israel New venues: nongovernmental organizations and social change Activism: support, conflict, and ideas Two tales of a city: history, space, and identity Honor, land, and protest ...''

Between 1994 and 2009, the city had a declining and [[Population ageing|aging population]] compared to [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Jerusalem]], as young people moved to the center of the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to [[Bedroom community|bedroom communities]] in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.<ref name=Monocle/><ref name="demo">{{cite web|url=http://urbaneconomics.blogspot.com/2006/12/is-haifa-aging.html |publisher=urbaneconomics.blogspot.com |title=Is Haifa Ageing? |accessdate=10 February 2008 |date=6 December 2006 |work= Central Bureau of Statistics, Statistical Abstract of Israel, no. 56, 2005}}</ref>

The population is heterogeneous. [[Jews]] comprise some 82% of the population, almost 14% are Christians (the majority of whom are [[Arab Christians]])<ref name="demo"/> and, some 4% are [[Muslims]] (of which many are [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi]]s<ref>There are about 2,200 Ahmadis in Kababir of the 4% (under 11,000) Muslims:

Nineteen percent of the city's Jewish and other population is between 45 and 59, compared to 14% of the Arab population. This continues with 14% of Jews and others aged 60–74 and 10% over age 75, in comparison to 7% and just 2% respectively in the Arab population.<ref name="demographics"/>

==Flora and fauna==
The Carmel Mountain has three main [[wadi]]s: Lotem, Amik and Si’ach. For the most part these valleys are undeveloped natural corridors that run up through the city from the coast to the top of the mountain. Marked hiking paths traverse these areas and they provide habitat for wildlife such as wild boar, [[golden jackal]], [[hyrax]], [[Egyptian mongoose]], [[owls]] and chameleons.

==Neighborhoods==
[[File:Haifa 2872-1.jpg|thumb|[[Bat Galim]] neighborhood and [[Haifa Bay]]]]
[[File:Haifa 3082-1.jpg|thumb|Panorama Towers]]

Haifa has developed in tiers, from the lower to the upper city on the Carmel. The oldest neighborhood in the modern Haifa is [[Wadi Salib]], the Old City center near the port, which has been bisected by a major road and razed in part to make way for [[Government Buildings|government buildings]]. Wadi Salib stretches across to [[Wadi Nisnas]], the center of Arab life in Haifa today. In the 19th century, under Ottoman rule, the [[German Colony, Haifa|German Colony]] was built, providing the first model of [[urban planning]] in Haifa. Some of the buildings have been restored and the colony has turned into a center of Haifa nightlife.<ref name="tiers"/>

The first buildings in [[Hadar HaCarmel|Hadar]] were constructed at the start of the 20th century. Hadar was Haifa's cultural center and marketplace throughout the 1920s and into the 1980s, nestled above and around the Haifa's Arab neighborhoods. Today Hadar stretches from the port area near the bay, approximately halfway up Mount Carmel, around the German Colony, Wadi Nisnas and Wadi Salib.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/viehaifa.html |title=Haifa |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref> Hadar houses two commercial centers (one in the port area, and one midway up the mountain) surrounded by some of the city's older neighborhoods.

[[Neve Sha'anan, Haifa|Neve Sha'anan]], a neighborhood located on the second tier of Mount Carmel, was founded in the 1920s. West of the port are the neighborhoods of [[Bat Galim]], Shikmona Beach, and [[Kiryat Eliezer, Haifa|Kiryat Eliezer]]. To the west and east of Hadar are the Arab neighborhoods of Abbas and Khalisa, built in the 1960s and 70s.<ref name="go">{{cite web|url=http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Euk/Tourist+Information/Discover+Israel/Cities/Haifa.htm |title=Haifa |publisher=Israel Government Tourism Ministry |accessdate=21 March 2008}}</ref> To the south of Mount Carmel's headland, along the road to Tel Aviv, are the neighborhoods of Ein HaYam, Shaar HaAliya, Kiryat Sprinzak and Neve David.

Above Hadar are affluent neighborhoods such as the [[French Carmel|Carmel Tzarfati]] (French Carmel), Merkaz Ha'Carmel, [[Ramot Ben Gurion|Romema]], Ahuzat Ha'Carmel (Ahuza), Carmeliya, [[Vardia|Vardiya]], [[Ramat Golda]], [[Ramat Alon]] and Hod Ha'Carmel (Denya). While there are general divisions between Arab and Jewish neighborhoods, there is an increasing trend for wealthy Arabs to move into affluent Jewish neighborhoods.<ref name="demo"/> Another of the Carmel neighborhoods is [[Kababir]], home to the National Headquarters of Israel's [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]];<ref name="go"/> located near Merkaz HaCarmel and overlooking the coast.

==Urban development==
Recently, residential construction has been concentrated around [[Kiryat Haim]] and Kiryat Shmuel, with {{convert|75000|m²|0|abbr=on}} of new residential construction between 2002–2004, the Carmel, with {{convert|70000|m²|0|abbr=on}}, and Ramot Neve Sha'anan with approximately {{convert|70000|m²|0|abbr=on}}<ref name="building">{{cite web|url=http://www1.haifa.muni.il/spru/doc/YB/Building/Y2004/Download/BuildingDL.pdf|format=PDF|title=Building |publisher=Haifa Municipality |work=Haifa Statistical Yearbook |accessdate=21 February 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409211937/http://www1.haifa.muni.il/spru/doc/YB/Building/Y2004/Download/BuildingDL.pdf |archivedate = 9 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Non-residential construction was highest in the [[Lower Town]], (90,000 sq m), Haifa Bay (72,000 sq m) and Ramot Neve Sha'anan (54,000 sq m).<ref name="building"/> In 2004, 80% of construction in the city was private.<ref name="building"/>

Currently, the city has a modest number of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings, and many additional high-rise buildings are planned, have been approved, or are under construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/city/haifa-israel/high-rise-buildings |title=high-rise buildings &#124; Buildings |publisher=Emporis |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> Though buildings rising up to 20 stories were built on [[Mount Carmel]] in the past, the Haifa municipality banned the construction of any new buildings taller than nine stories on Mount Carmel in July 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=844707 |title=Gad Zeevi demands Haifa permit high-rises on the Carmel |publisher=Globes |date=17 October 2004 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

The neighborhood of [[Wadi Salib]], located in the heart of downtown Haifa, is being redeveloped. Most of its Jewish and Arab residents are considered squatters and have been gradually evicted over the years. The Haifa Economic Corporation Ltd is developing two 1,000 square meter lots for office and commercial use.<ref>[http://www.hec.co.il/Calcalit/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=84&FID=276 Haifa Economic Corporation Ltd: Wadi Salib] Haifa Economic Corporation {{wayback|url=http://www.hec.co.il/Calcalit/Templates/showpage.asp?DBID=1&LNGID=1&TMID=84&FID=276 |date=20110721135506 |df=y }}</ref> Some historic buildings have been renovated and redeveloped, especially into nightclubs and theaters, such as the Palace of the Pasha, a [[Turkish bath]]house, and a [[Middle Eastern music]] and [[Nightclub|dance club]], which has been converted into theaters and offices.<ref name=Johal/>

In 2012, a new, massive development plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western section of the city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The west side of the port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently bisect the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250979,00.html |title=Plan aims to turn Haifa into 'the Barcelona of Israel' - Israel Business, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref> A park will be developed on the border of the [[Kishon River]], the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port to the rest of the city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center.<ref name=hotels/> In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4330877,00.html |title=Move of Haifa Bay's ammonia tank tangled in red tape - Israel Environment, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

Another plan seeks to turn the western section of Haifa Port into a major tourism and nightlife center, as well as a functioning point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel. All port activity will be moved to the western side, and the area will be redeveloped. Public spaces and a beach promenade will be developed, and commercial buildings will be renovated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4250979,00.html |title=Plan aims to turn Haifa into 'the Barcelona of Israel' - Israel Business, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}</ref>

As part of the development plans, the [[Israeli Navy]], which has a large presence in Haifa, will withdraw from the shoreline between [[Bat Galim]] and Hof Hashaket. A {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=off|sp=us|adj=on}} long [[esplanade]] which will encircle the shoreline will be constructed. It will include a bicycle path, and possibly also a small bridge under which navy vessels will pass on their way to the sea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4312236,00.html|title=Haifa residents invited to 'smash wall' - Israel Travel, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

In addition, a 50,000 square-meter entertainment complex that will contain a [[Disney]] theme park, cinemas, shops, and a 25-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|Multiplex theater]] will be built at the Check Post exit from the Carmel Tunnels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000612861&fid=1124 |title=NIS 600m Disney park, multiplex planned for Haifa |publisher=Globes |date=3 January 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, a new major plan for the city was proposed, under which extensive development of residential, business, and leisure areas will take place with the target of increasing the city's population by 60,000 by 2025. Under the plan, five new neighborhoods will be built, along with new high-tech parks. In addition, existing employment centers will be renovated, and new leisure areas and a large park will be built.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-haifa-outline-plan-filed-for-objections-1000920431 |title=Haifa outline plan filed for objections |publisher=Globes.co.il |date=26 February 2014 |accessdate=16 July 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, ''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' magazine identified Haifa as the city with the most promising business potential, with the greatest investment opportunities in the world. The magazine noted that "a massive head-to-toe regeneration is starting to have an impact; from scaffolding and cranes around town, to renovated façades and new smart places to eat". The Haifa municipality had spent more than $350 million on roads and infrastructure, and the number of building permits had risen 83% in the previous two years.<ref name=Monocle>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3988794,00.html |title=Haifa: Greatest business potential - Israel Business, Ynetnews |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}</ref>

==Government==
As an industrial port city, Haifa has traditionally been a [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor party]] stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and [[trade union]]s earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent Arabs in the [[Communist Party of Israel|Israeli Communist Party]], among them [[Tawfik Toubi]], [[Emile Habibi]], [[Zahi Karkabi]], [[Bulus Farah]] and [[Emile Toma]], were from Haifa.

Before 1948, Haifa's Municipality was fairly unusual as it developed cooperation between the mixed Arab and Jewish community in the city, with representatives of both groups involved in the city's management. Under mayor al-Haj, between 1920 and 1927, the [[city council]] had six Arab and two Jewish representatives, with the city run as a mixed municipality with overall Arab control. Greater cooperation was introduced under [[Hasan Bey Shukri]], who adopted a positive and conciliatory attitude toward the city's Jews and gave them senior posts in the municipality.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eyadat |first=Fadi |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1150667.html |title=Haifa honors first mayor's legacy of coexistence |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}</ref> In 1940, the first Jewish mayor, [[Shabtai Levy]], was elected.

Today, Haifa is governed by its 12th city council, headed by the mayor [[Yona Yahav]]. The results of municipal elections decide on the makeup of the council, similarly to the [[Knesset]] elections.

==Education==
Haifa is home to two internationally acclaimed universities and several colleges The [[University of Haifa]], founded in 1963, is at the top of Mt. Carmel. The campus was designed by the architect of [[Brasília]] and [[United Nations Headquarters]] in [[New York]], [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. The top floor of the 30-story Eshkol Tower provides a panoramic view of northern Israel. The [[Hecht Museum]], with important archeology and art collections, is on the campus of Haifa University.

The [[Technion|Technion - Israel Institute of Technology]], described as Israel's [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], was founded in 1912.

==Transportation==
Haifa is served by six [[Rail transport|railway]] stations and the [[Carmelit]], currently Israel's only [[Rapid transit|subway]] system (another is under construction in Tel Aviv). The [[Nahariya]]–[[Tel Aviv]] [[Coastal railway line, Israel|Coastal Railway]] main line of [[Israel Railways]] runs along the coast of the [[Haifa Bay|Gulf of Haifa]] and has six stations within the city. From south-west to north-east, these stations are: [[Haifa Hof HaCarmel Railway Station|Haifa Hof HaCarmel]], [[Haifa Bat Galim Railway Station|Haifa Bat Galim]], [[Haifa Center HaShmona Railway Station|Haifa Merkaz HaShmona]], [[Lev HaMifratz Railway Station|Lev HaMifratz]], [[Hutzot HaMifratz Railway Station|Hutzot HaMifratz]] and [[Kiryat Haim Railway Station|Kiryat Haim]]. Together with the [[Kiryat Motzkin Railway Station]] in the northern suburb [[Kiryat Motzkin]], they form the Haifa - Krayot suburban line ("Parvarit").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israrail.org.il/english/travel/map.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301032459/http://www.israrail.org.il/english/travel/map.html |archivedate=1 March 2007 |title=Railway Map |publisher=Israel Railways |accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref> There are direct trains from Haifa to [[Tel Aviv]], [[Ben Gurion International Airport]], [[Nahariya]], [[Acre, Israel|Akko]], [[Kiryat Motzkin]], [[Binyamina]], [[Lod]], [[Ramla]], [[Beit Shemesh]], [[Jerusalem]] and other locations, but all trains to Beersheba skips all Haifa stations

Haifa's [[Bus|intercity bus]] connections are operated almost exclusively by the [[Egged (company)|Egged]] bus company, which operates two terminals:
* [[HaMifratz Central Bus Station]], adjacent to the [[Lev HaMifratz Railway Station]]
* [[Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station]], adjacent to the [[Haifa Hof HaCarmel Railway Station|Hof HaCarmel Railway Station]]
Lines to the North of the country use [[HaMifratz Central Bus Station]] and their coverage includes most towns in the North of Israel. Lines heading south use [[Haifa Hof HaCarmel Central Bus Station]]. [[File:Haifa-09-Carmelit.jpg|thumb|left| The [[Carmelit]], currently Israel's only subway]]Destinations directly reachable from Hof HaCarmel CBS include [[Tel Aviv]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Eilat]], [[Ra'anana|Raanana]], [[Netanya]], [[Hadera]], [[Zikhron Ya'akov]], [[Atlit]], [[Tirat Carmel]], [[Ben Gurion International Airport]] and intermediate communities. There are also three Egged lines that have their terminus in the [[Ramat Vizhnitz]] neighborhood and run to [[Jerusalem]], [[Bnei Brak]] and [[Ashdod]]. These used to be "''[[mehadrin bus lines|mehadrin]]''" (i.e. gender segregated) lines.

[[File:Metronit track.jpg|thumb|Completed [[Metronit]] track in downtown Haifa]]
All urban lines are run by Egged. There are also [[share taxi]]s that run along some bus routes but do not have an official schedule. In 2006, Haifa implemented a trial network of neighborhood mini-buses – named "Shkhunatit" and run by [[Egged (company)|Egged]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150885952889&pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull|title=Egged to start minibus project in Haifa|work=[[The Jerusalem Post|Jerusalem Post]]|date=9 June 2006|accessdate=22 February 2008}}</ref> In December 2012, [[GetTaxi]], an app and taxi service which allows users to hail a cab using their smartphone without contacting the taxi station by identifying and summoning the closest taxi.

Haifa and the [[Krayot (Haifa)|Krayot]] suburbs also have a new [[Phileas (public transport)|Phileas concept]] [[bus rapid transit]] system called the [[Metronit]]. These buses, operating with [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] engines, follow optical strips embedded in designated lanes of roads, providing tram-like public transportation services. The Metronit consists of 100 18-meter buses, each with the capacity for 150 passengers, operating along {{convert|40|km|0|abbr=on}} of designated roadways.<ref>{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Ron |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Haifa-to-get-new-Metronit-Bus-Rapid-Transit-system-by-2011 |title=Haifa to get new 'Metronit' Bus Rapid Transit system by 2011 &#124; JPost &#124; Israel News |publisher=JPost |date= |accessdate=13 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yefenof.co.il/pages/lighTrain.php|title=Metronit|publisher=Yefenof.co.il |accessdate=22 February 2008 |language=Hebrew |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080221164200/http://www.yefenof.co.il/pages/lighTrain.php |archivedate = 21 February 2008}}</ref> The new system officially opened on 16 August 2013 serving three lines.

The Haifa underground railway system is called [[Carmelit]]. It is a subterranean [[funicular]] on rails, running from downtown Paris Square to Gan HaEm (Mother's Park) on [[Mount Carmel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tour-haifa.co.il/eng/modules/article/view.article.php/c10/159|title=The Carmelit|accessdate=19 February 2008|publisher=Tour-Haifa.co.il}}</ref> With a single track, six stations and two trains, it is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the world's shortest metro line. The Carmelit accommodates bicycles.

Haifa also has a [[cable car]]. The [[Cable cars in Haifa|Haifa Cable Car]] [[gondola lift]] consists of six cabins and connects [[Bat Galim]] on the coast to the [[Stella Maris Monastery|Stella Maris]] [[Deck (building)|observation deck]] and monastery atop [[Mount Carmel]].
