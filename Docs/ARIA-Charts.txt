The '''ARIA Charts''' are the main [[Australia]]n [[record chart|music sales chart]]s, issued weekly by the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]]. The charts are a record of the highest selling [[Single (music)|singles]] and [[album]]s in various genres in Australia. ARIA became the official Australian music chart in June 1988, succeeding the [[Kent Music Report]] which had been Australia's national charts since 1974.

==History==
The ''[[Go-Set]]'' charts were Australia's first national singles and albums charts published from 2 February 1966 until 24 August 1974. Succeeding ''Go-Set'', the Kent Music Report began issuing the national top 100 charts in Australia from May 1974. The compiler, [[David Kent (historian)|David Kent]], also published Australia's national charts from 1940â€“1974 in a retrospective fashion using state based data. In mid 1983, the Australian Recording Industry Association commenced licensing the Kent Music Report chart.<ref name=process>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/RSOvsNY.png|title=The ARIA Chart Process (from The ARIA Report Issue No. 29)|publisher=Imgur.com|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref>  The first printed national top 50 chart available in record stores, branded the ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'' chart, was dated the week ending 10 July 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7OxWO4I2NY|title=The first ARIA top 50 singles chart (Countdown, 3rd July 1983)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref>

ARIA began compiling its own charts in-house from the chart dated week ending 26 June 1988.<ref>{{cite web|first=Gavin|last=Scott|url=http://chartbeat.blogspot.com.au/2013/06/25-years-ago-this-week-june-26-1988.html|title=25 Years Ago This Week: June 26, 1988|publisher=blogspot.com.au|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref>  Various artists compilation albums were initially included in the albums chart, as they had been on the Kent Report chart, until 2 July 1989, when a separate Compilations chart was created.<ref>{{cite web|first=Gavin|last=Scott|url=http://chartbeat.blogspot.com.au/2014/07/25-years-ago-this-week-july-2-1989.html|title=25 Years Ago This Week: July 2, 1989|publisher=blogspot.com.au|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref>  ''The ARIA Report'', detailing the top 100 singles and albums charts, was first available via subscription in January 1990.<ref name=process/>  The printed top 50 chart ceased publication in June 1998,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://i.imgur.com/tvFYut7.jpg|title=The ARIA Chart 7 June 1998 (Victoria & Tasmania State Chart)|publisher=[[Imgur]]|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> but resumed publication later in the year.  The printed top 50 chart again ceased publication at the end of 2000.<ref name=arianet/>

The ARIA charts are based on data collected from physical and digital retailers in Australia. Data of physical sales come from retailers such as [[Sanity (music store)|Sanity]] and [[JB Hi-Fi]], while data of digital sales come from online retailers such as [[iTunes Store|iTunes]], Bandit FM, GetMusic and [[BigPond|BigPond Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/about/chart-stores|title=ARIA Chart Stores|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>  Since 17 February 1997, all physical sales data contributing towards the chart has been recorded electronically at point of sale.<ref name=arianet>{{cite web|url=http://aria.com.au/ariaa.htm |title=The ARIAnet Charts |publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]] |accessdate=23 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010405010937/http://aria.com.au/ariaa.htm |archivedate=5 April 2001 }}</ref>

Starting from 8 October 2006, due to low physical single sales at the time, the ARIA singles chart included online data as well as physical sales. In 2006, it was announced that the Brazin retailing group, comprising major retailers [[HMV]], Sanity and Virgin music/DVD stores would no longer contribute sales data to the ARIA charts.<ref>[http://www.undercover.com.au/news/2006/may06/20060519_aria.html Undercover - Your Daily Music Fix<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.news.com.au/story/0,10221,19186936-7484,00.html | title=Dining out: Lady Gaga turns heads}}</ref> However, after a five-month absence, Brazin reportedly re-commenced contributing sales figures to the ARIA Charts on 26 November 2006.<ref>[http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ipHMutq58FEX3rN%2F%2BwEUmag%3D%3D Brazin Data Returns To Aus Charts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Since 1 June 2013, the [[Take 40 Australia]] radio program has broadcast the ARIA top 40 singles on Saturday afternoons, typically from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm, on each state's [[Hit Network]]-owned radio station.<ref name="Take 40">{{cite web|url=http://www.take40.com/|title=Take 40, Top 40 Countdown Australia, Music Charts|publisher=ARIA Charts|date=4 April 2016|accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref> The show is aired before the top 50 chart, dated for the following Monday, is published on the ARIA website at 6:00 pm.<ref name="Take 40"/> The charts were previously published online at 6:00 pm each Sunday.<ref name="Take 40"/> The website publishes the top 50 singles and albums charts (truncated from the top 100), top 40 digital tracks chart (truncated from the top 50), and top 20 dance singles chart (truncated from the top 25). The ARIA Report lists all charts in full and is available via paid e-mail subscription each week. These reports are uploaded to the [[Pandora Archive]] periodically.
