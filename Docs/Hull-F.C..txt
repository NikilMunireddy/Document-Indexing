'''Hull Football Club''', commonly referred to as '''Hull''' or '''Hull F.C.''', is a professional [[rugby league]] football club established in 1865 and based in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], England. The club plays in the [[Super League]] competition. It was known as '''Hull Sharks''' from 1996-99.

Hull F.C. were one of the founding members of the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] which was formed in 1895 in Huddersfield, making them one of the world's first twenty-two rugby league clubs. Later that year they moved to the Hull Athletic Club's ground at [[The Boulevard (stadium)|the Boulevard]], Airlie Street, which gave rise to their nickname the "Airlie Birds". Traditionally people from the west side of [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] support Hull FC while [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] are supported by the east half, the 'border' being regarded as the [[River Hull]].

Old Faithful is a traditional Hull terrace song. The team shares the [[KC Stadium]] with association football side [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. Their mascot is the "Airlie Bird".

==History==

===Early years===
The club was formed in 1865 by a group of ex-schoolboys from [[York]], most notably [[Anthony Bradley]], who had been at [[Rugby School]]. The founders used to meet at the Young Men's Fellowship, at St. Mary’s Church in Lowgate. The vicar at that time was the Reverend Scott and his five sons made up the nucleus of the team. The club immediately took on members who were plumbers and glaziers. Soon another team, Hull White Star, was formed and the two clubs merged. Hull Football Club was one of the first clubs in the north of England to join the [[Rugby Football Union]].

Hull, then nicknamed the All Blacks, were one of the initial 22 clubs to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] after the [[History of rugby league#The schism in Great Britain|acrimonious split]] from the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1895. The club moved from East Hull to the Hull Athletic Club at the Boulevard in 1895, and subsequently played their first ever match there in September of that year. 8,000 people turned out to witness the first club's match in which Hull beat [[Liversedge RFC (Rugby League)|Liversedge]].

The early years of the Northern Union saw Hull prosper, and their black and white irregular hooped jerseys became one of the most famous and feared strips in the league. Between 1908–10, Hull lost three consecutive [[Challenge Cup]] finals. In the first; they failed to score against [[Hunslet Hawks|Hunslet]] who would go on to win [[All Four Cups]] whilst in the second they failed to score against [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats|Wakefield Trinity]]. In the third final of 1910, they held [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] to a 7–7 draw at [[Fartown Ground, Huddersfield|Fartown]], [[Huddersfield]] but were heavily beaten in the replay held two days later.

In 1913, they paid a world record £600, plus £14 per match, to Hunslet for [[Billy Batten]], one of only seventeen players, and the only representative from Hull FC, so far inducted into the [[British Rugby League Hall of Fame]]. A year later the Airlie Birds won their first Challenge Cup, beating Huddersfield in the semi-final and [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats|Wakefield Trinity]] in the final held in Halifax. Playing alongside Billy on that day was [[John Harrison (VC 1917)|John "Jack" Harrison VC, MC]] who scored a try. Harrison scored 52 tries in the 1913–4 season, a club record that still stands.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-28405119</ref> Twelve Hull players were killed during the First World War.

Australian [[Jim Devereux]] became the first player to score 100 tries for Hull.<ref>[http://www.hullfc.com/page.aspx?p=1088 Hull's Australians] at [[Hull FC]].com</ref>

In 1920, Batten was once again key in Hull's first ever [[Rugby Football League Championship|Championship]] final, scoring the only try in the 3–2 victory over [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]].

The early-1920s were bittersweet years for the club. In 1921, Hull won the [[Rugby league county cups|Yorkshire Cup]] but lost the [[Rugby league county leagues|county championship]], both against rivals [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. Hull couldn't match the successes of 1914, losing a further two consecutive cup finals in 1922–23 to [[Rochdale Hornets]] and [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] respectively, but they managed to win the [[Rugby league county cups|Yorkshire Cup]] and finish top of the league.

In the early 1930s, Hull had a full back and goal kicker called [[Joseph Oliver (rugby league)|Joe Oliver]]. Oliver was so dependable with the boot that the crowd at one match spontaneously started singing the [[Gene Autry]] song, [[Old Faithful, rugby league song|Old Faithful]] at him. Hull supporters adopted the song as their battle cry from then on.

Hull's record attendance was set in 1936 when 28,798 turned up for the visit of Leeds for a third round Challenge cup match.

=== Post Second World War ===
The 1952 Kangaroos visited the Boulevard on Monday 8 September. They had opened their tour with a victory at [[Keighley Cougars|Keighley]] two days earlier, and they continued their winning run with a 28–0 victory over Hull.

In 1949, the black Welshman [[Roy Francis (rugby)|Roy Francis]] became the first black professional coach in any British team sport, when he coached Hull.

Hull team won the [[Rugby Football League Championship|league championship]] in 1956 when [[Colin Hutton]] kicked a last-minute penalty in the final against [[Halifax RLFC|Halifax]] at [[Maine Road]], Manchester. Hull won the play-offs again in 1958, against [[Workington Town]]. They also won the European Club championship in 1957 and lost in the cup finals at Wembley in 1959 and 1960. These triumphs healed the wound of two successive [[Rugby league county cups|Yorkshire Cup]] final defeats in 1955 and 1957. They lost in two further Challenge Cup finals to [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] and [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats|Wakefield Trinity]] in 1959 and 1960. All these reverses, when one hand had been grasping so many trophies, gave Hull a steely resolve and a thirst for success.

[[Johnny Whiteley]] became player coach in October 1963. When Roy Francis retired as Hull FC coach in 1965, Whiteley took over as coach. Hull F.C. lost to Wakefield Trinity 17–10 victory in the 1968 Rugby Football League Championship final at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] on 4 May 1968. Whiteley resigned in 1970 to coach [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. [[Ivor Watts]] was then appointed coach from 1970–1971 of which Hull won 28 matches and lost 17.

With the coaching appointment of [[Arthur Bunting]] in 1978, Hull began a period of dominance. Hull won all of their 26 Division Two matches in 1978–79, the only time a club has won all of its league matches in a season and returning to the top flight. The Airlie Birds lost the 1980 Challenge Cup final against [[Hull Kingston Rovers|Hull KR]] 10–5 and have never won at Wembley since. It was reputed that a makeshift sign was left on the A63 (the major westerly road out of Hull) that read "last one out turn the lights off!" due to most of the city travelling to Wembley for the final. In 1982, Hull, crushed by [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] in the [[Rugby League Premiership|Premiership]] final, avenged the defeat with an 18–9 Challenge Cup replay win at [[Elland Road]].

[[File:KC Stadium.JPG|thumb|200px|right|[[KC Stadium|Kingston Communications Stadium]].]]Hull eventually won the league in 1983 and also reached the Premiership final, the Challenge Cup final and the [[Rugby league county cups|Yorkshire Cup]] final, but the latter trophy would be their only reward from the three finals. They lost to [[Featherstone Rovers]] at Wembley in one of the great Challenge Cup final upsets and they also lost the Premiership final three years running.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/david-topliss-sparkling-rugby-international-849946.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=David Topliss: Sparkling rugby international | date=19 June 2008 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

The signing of Australian [[Peter Sterling]], a 2006 inductee into the [[Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame]], maintained Hull’s strength, and Bunting’s men went to their third successive Yorkshire Cup beating Hull KR 29–12, but were edged out in arguably the greatest ever [[Challenge Cup]] final in [[1984-85 Challenge Cup|1984–85]] by [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] with a score of 28 to 24 in Wigan's favour. The game was played in front 99,801 fans, the rugby league attendance record for Wembley. A number of subsequent coaches, such as [[Brian Smith (rugby league, born 1954)|Brian Smith]] (1988–90) failed to deliver consistent success. Hull lost the Premiership final in 1989 to [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]], but two years later returned to beat them 14–4 at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]] under coach [[Noel Cleal]].

[[Royce Simmons]] moved to England to coach Hull for two seasons from 1992 to 1994.<ref>{{cite web|last=hullfc.com|title=Coaches and Captains|url=http://www.hullfc.com/page.aspx?p=998|work=History|publisher=[[Hull FC]]|accessdate=18 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

===Summer era===

[[File:Hull-sharks.gif|left|thumb|Hull Sharks club logo]]
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural [[Super League]] season and changed from a winter to a summer season.<ref name="hadfield20-12-95">{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rugbys-pounds-87m-deal-gives-murdoch-transfer-veto-1526582.html |publisher= The Independent |title=Rugby's pounds 87m deal gives Murdoch transfer veto |author=Dave Hadfield |date=20 December 1995 |accessdate=6 May 2009 | location=London}}</ref> As the sport in Britain entered a new era, controversy was sparked in the city of Hull when it was suggested that Hull should merge with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] to form 'Humberside'. Hull FC's shareholders gave the idea general approval but it was ultimately resisted.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/british-tours-will-survive-the-super-league-fallout-1616669.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=British tours will survive the Super League fall-out | first=Dave | last=Hadfield | date=22 April 1995 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> The club like many other rugby league clubs re-branded and became known as the ''Hull Sharks''. It is unclear who came up with the 'Sharks' as a nickname but for a nautical city it was a fairly obvious choice. Hull FC finished below the cut-off point of 10th in the existing top flight and so were excluded from the new Super League.

[[Phil Sigsworth]] joined the club in 1996 and coached them to the First Division championship title and promotion to [[Super League]] in 1997. However, the club struggled to gain a foothold in the competition under new manager Peter Walsh. The renaming was unpopular with the supporters, and the club spiralled in to financial difficulties and went out of business. Hull Sharks closed and was taken over by the recently formed expansion team [[Gateshead Thunder (1999)|Gateshead Thunder]] at the end of 1999 (with the backing of the Super League).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/gateshead-fold-as-league--agrees-merger-741473.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Gateshead fold as League agrees merger | first=Ian | last=Laybourn | date=16 November 1999}}</ref> The Association of Premiership Clubs blocked proposals for the newly merged company to enter a Hull-based team in the [[Northern Ford Premiership]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/attempted-revival-of-don-valley-club-hits-the-buffers-741474.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Attempted revival of Don Valley club hits the buffers | first=Dave | last=Hadfield | date=27 November 1999 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> and so Hull FC closed and Gateshead Thunder took over the traditional Hull FC identity in Super League and moved its home games to The Boulevard. Most of the Gateshead playing squad moved to Hull FC along with their Board and ex-[[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]] coach [[Shaun McRae]] who remained at the helm until 2004.

After 107 years at the [[The Boulevard (stadium)|Boulevard]], Hull FC moved in January 2003 to a £44&nbsp;million state-of-the-art [[Hull City Council|council-owned]] Kingston Communications Stadium, more commonly known as the [[KC Stadium]] and the rejuvenation of the club continued. Although they are joint tenants at the stadium alongside the city's football club Championship side Hull City AFC : the two teams sharing use of the stadium, Hull FC have been forced to play a cup match away at Doncaster to avoid two matches clashing. Shaun McRae left the club to return to Australia at the end of the 2004 season; he was replaced by former [[England national rugby league team|England]] coach [[John Kear]], who had previously been McRae's deputy.

In his first season at the club, Kear led Hull FC to the Rugby League [[Challenge Cup]] final for the first time since 1985. Hull FC defeated [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] 25–24 in a thrilling final at [[Cardiff]]'s [[Millennium Stadium]] to lift the trophy. Paul Cooke's 77th minute try, which was converted by Danny Brough gave Hull FC a 1-point lead, which they held onto after Hull FC captain Richard Swain charged down a drop-goal attempt from Leeds skipper [[Kevin Sinfield]] in the dying seconds of the match.

John Kear left Hull FC on 3 April 2006 after a disappointing start to the season, which saw Hull lose four out of their first seven league games and also their defence of the Challenge Cup being ended at the first hurdle against the [[Bradford Bulls]] in a 23–12 defeat, to be replaced by Australian [[Peter Sharp]] who was recruited from [[Parramatta Eels]] where he was assistant coach. Between 14 April – 15 July 2006 Hull won 13 matches in succession, including a 27–26 defeat of the league leaders St Helens on 8 June 2006. The last time they beat St Helens on their ground was 18 years ago. This run ended in defeat at [[Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]] on 23 July 2006. Hull FC managed to finish in second place, their highest league position in the [[Super League]] era. They lost to the league leaders [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]] in the first Grand Final playoff game, but succeeded in reaching the final by defeating the reigning champions Bradford. Over 20,000 Hull FC fans travelled to [[Old Trafford]], but again they lost out to the Saints, this time by 26–4. The overall attendance broke the Grand Final record, mainly due to the stadium's recent expansion.

For the 2007 season, Hull FC signed five players: [[Matt Sing]] (a prolific [[National Rugby League]] try-scorer and [[Australian Kangaroos|Australian]] representative), Hutch Maiava, Willie Manu, Danny Tickle and Wayne Godwin. Also, the  ''Hull Football Club v Hull Kingston Rovers'' derbies are back for the 2007 season due to Rovers' promotion from National League 1. The first of four of these derby matches was played on [[Easter Monday]], 9 April 2007, at the KC Stadium. The game was played in front of a [[sell-out]] attendance of 23,002 and ended with a result for the Black and Whites who had been struggling early in the season. The final score was 22–14 with [[Sid Domic]] crossing the line for the Airlie Birds in the final seconds.

[[File:Leeds Rhinos 001.jpg|thumb|right|Hull facing [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]], May 2009]]
On 23 April [[Paul Cooke]], stand-off, controversially resigned from Hull Football Club to join [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. Cooke claimed he was out of contract as he had not signed the contract that the club had offered him. Following his departure, club chief executive David Plummer resigned. His replacement James Rule has come in for much criticism.

Hull FC have endured a poor 2008 season and on 19 May 2008 the club dismissed coach [[Peter Sharp]]. A week later they appointed his assistant [[Richard Agar]] as his replacement. John Sharp has since been named as an addition to the Hull FC coaching staff. Hull finished a poor 11th in the League in 2008, falling far short of the fans expectations, although a Challenge cup final appearance and a successful franchise application ensured the season was not a complete failure. The club announced that Australian test forward [[Michael Crocker]] will sign for the club on a three-year contract from the start of the 2008–09 season. Fullback [[Chris Thorman]] has signed a one-year deal for 2009, after leaving [[Huddersfield Giants|Huddersfield]]. Matty Dale, Matt Sing and James Webster were released at the end of the season. Former HKR favourite – Webster having only played one game.

In March 2009 [[Michael Crocker]] was denied a visa to come to England to play for Hull FC. Hull FC announced four big name signings for the 2010 SL season: Craig Fitzgibbon, Mark O'Meley, Sean Long, and Jordan Tansey (although Tansey arrived at the club towards the end of the 2009 season, having been released early from his contract at Sydney Roosters). Several long serving players left the club at the end of the forgettable 2009 season, including Paul King, Graeme Horne, and Gareth Raynor.

[[Super League XV]] started well with five wins from the first seven games, the two losses coming away against [[Crusaders Rugby League|Crusaders]] and Wigan Warriors. FC beat Hull KR 18–14 in the first derby of the year at Craven Park, but then followed a period of one win from five games, in which the team were convincingly knocked out of the Challenge Cup by Leeds. Hull FC finished the regular season in 6th place, however a convincing 21–4 home defeat to rivals [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] brought an early end to their playoff campaign.

On 22 July 2011 it was confirmed that [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]'s Head of Football Operations, Adam Pearson had purchased the entire shareholding of the club together with his close friend Mikey Drake and they had taken over full control from Kath Hetherington. In a statement on the club's website, it was also confirmed that James Rule would continue as chief executive.<ref>{{Cite news|title=CLUB STATEMENT: ADAM PEARSON ON TAKEOVER|url=http://www.hullfc.com/newsarticle.aspx?n=18194|publisher=Hull F.C.|date=22 July 2011|accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

Richard Agar left the club at the end of the 2011 season and was replaced by Australian [[Peter Gentle]]. The 2012 season was a largely transitional one, with high player turnover and many injuries hampering the side's progress mid-season, however the club finished a respectable 6th in the regular season. They went on to convincingly beat Huddersfield in the first round of play-off games but fell to defeat away at Warrington in the preliminary semi-finals.

For the 2013 season, Hull again finished 6th in the regular season and beat Catalans at home in the first round of the play-offs but were comprehensively beaten 76–18 by Huddersfield in the second round. Hull also reached the Challenge cup final for the first time in 5 years but were beaten 16–0 by Wigan. On 24 September 2013 Hull FC announced the departure of Peter Gentle with two years still remaining on his contract. It is thought the record loss to Huddersfield in the play-offs along with the poor performance at Wembley were the main factors behind his demise. The next day Hull announced that 34-year-old assistant [[Lee Radford]] will become Head Coach from 2014 and Andy Last would step up to become Lee's assistant. Also former player [[Motu Tony]] becomes the new director of football, replacing outgoing director [[Shaun McRae]].

==Stadiums==
===1895-2002: The Boulevard===
Hull F.C. moved into [[The Boulevard (stadium)|The Boulevard]] shortly after the formation of the [[RFL]]. Between 1904 and 1905 the ground was shared with [[Hull City A.F.C.]] and speedway also took place during the 1940s, 70s and 80s and also had a greyhound track in 2007. The Boulevard also host many international rugby league games. Like a number of grounds at the time, the pitch at The Boulevard was surrounded by a [[Motorcycle speedway]] track that was also later used for Greyhound racing.

===2003 – present: KC Stadium===
In 2003 Hull F.C. moved into the [[KC Stadium]] which they share with Hull City for a second time in their history. The record attendance for a rugby league ground was 23,004 in 2007 when they played local rivals [[Hull KR]].
