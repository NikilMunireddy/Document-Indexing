Delta is the sixth-oldest operating airline by foundation date, and the oldest airline still operating in the United States. The [[History of Delta Air Lines|company's history]] can be traced back to ''Huff Daland Dusters'', founded in 1924 in [[Macon, Georgia]] as a [[Aerial application|crop dusting]] operation. The company moved to [[Monroe, Louisiana]], and was later renamed ''Delta Air Services'', in reference to the nearby [[Mississippi Delta]] region, and commenced passenger services on June 17, 1929. Among predecessors of today's Delta Air Lines, [[Western Airlines]] and [[Northwest Airlines]] began flying passengers in 1926 and 1927, respectively.

In 2013, Delta Air Lines was the [[World's largest airlines|world's largest airline]] in terms of scheduled passengers carried (120.6 million<!--Rounded from 120,636 thousand-->),<ref name="WATS_pax_carried">{{cite web | url=http://www.iata.org/publications/pages/wats-passenger-carried.aspx | title= Scheduled Passengers Carried | work=[[IATA]] World Air Transport Statistics (WATS), 58th edition | accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> and the second-largest in terms of both revenue passenger-kilometers flown (277.6 billion<!--Rounded from 277,560 million-->)<ref name="WATS_pax-km">{{cite web | url=http://www.iata.org/publications/Pages/wats-passenger-km.aspx | title= Scheduled Passenger - Kilometres Flown | work=[[IATA]] World Air Transport Statistics (WATS), 58th edition | accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref> and capacity (4.4 billion [[Available seat miles|ASM]]/week<!-- Source in ASK, but since airline is American: 7097533389km / 1.609 = 4411145673mi-->; March 2013).<ref>{{cite web|title=REVEALED:The World's 50 biggest airlines by capacity|url=http://www.theaviationwriter.com/2013/03/50-biggest-airlines-in-world_24.html|website=The Aviation Writer|accessdate=29 July 2014}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Delta Air Lines}}
[[File:Huff-Daland Duster.jpg|thumb|Restored Huff-Daland Duster]]
[[File:Delta DC-7.jpg|thumb|Delta [[Douglas DC-7]] circa 1955]]
[[File:Delta Air Lines Boeing 747-100 Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|Delta [[Boeing 747-100]] at [[Heathrow Airport|London]] in 1973.]]
Delta Air Lines was created as Huff Daland Dusters, Incorporated, an aerial crop dusting operation, on May 30, 1924 in Macon, Georgia. Formed with a Huff-Daland Duster, the first true crop duster, the plane was deployed to combat the boll weevil in 1925. Delta Air Corporation owned the plane (now in the [[Southern Museum of Flight]]). The company moved to Monroe, Louisiana, in 1925. [[Collett E. Woolman]], one of the original directors, purchased the company on September 13, 1928, and renamed it '''Delta Air Service'''. It began carrying passengers on June 17, 1929. The single passenger sat in a chair placed in the bin where the pesticide was usually kept.<ref name="NGE">Jamil S. Zainaldin of the Georgia Humanities Council, [http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1302&hl=y "Delta Air Lines"], ''[[The New Georgia Encyclopedia]]'' (updated May 31, 2007).</ref>

Delta grew through the addition of routes and the acquisition of other airlines. They replaced propeller planes with jets in the 1960s and entered international competition to Europe in the 1970s and across the Pacific in the 1980s. The logo of Delta Air Lines, originally unveiled in 1959, is reminiscent of the swept-wing design of the [[Douglas DC-8|DC-8]] airplanes. Often termed as the "widget" logo, the current version consists of two 3D triangles.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.famouslogos.net/delta-logo/ |title= Delta Air Lines Logo: Design and History|accessdate=August 31, 2011}}</ref>

===Predecessors===
[[File:nwa a330-300 n805nw arp.jpg|thumb|A Northwest Airlines Airbus A330-300, shortly before the merger with Delta in 2008]]

The current Delta Air Lines is the result of many airline mergers over a period of more than 80 years. The most recent merger was with [[Northwest Airlines]] on October 29, 2008 and at the time formed the world's largest airline. After approval of the merger, Northwest continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta until December 31, 2009 when both carriers' operating certificates were merged (the Delta certificate was kept).<ref name="heslin">{{cite news| title=Delta, Northwest approved to fly under single operating certificate| url=http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2009/12/delta-northwest-approved-to-fly-under-single-operating-certificate/13205/1| date=31 December 2009| work=[[USA Today]]| author=Rebecca Heslin| publisher=usatoday.com| accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref> Delta completed the integration with Northwest on January 31, 2010 when their [[Computer reservations system|reservation systems]] and websites were combined, and the Northwest Airlines name and brand were officially retired.<ref name="mouawad">{{cite news| title=Delta-Northwest Merger's Long and Complex Path| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/19/business/19air.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0| author=Jad Mouawad| date=18 May 2011| work=[[The New York Times]]| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref>

===Defunct Delta subsidiaries===
[[File:Delta Express Boeing 737-200 KvW.jpg|thumb|Delta Express [[Boeing 737]] in 2001]]
* [[Comair]] began services in March 1977 and was headquartered at [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]]. After successfully introducing 50-seat planes into the United States, it was acquired by Delta in October 1999. Comair became the main carrier of Delta Connection and operated over 400 daily flights from Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport throughout the U.S., Mexico, and Caribbean. Comair ceased operations on September 29, 2012, and was folded into Delta Connection operations.
* [[Delta Express]] began service in October 1996 in an attempt by Delta to compete with [[Low-cost carrier|low cost airlines]] on leisure-oriented routes. Its main base of operations was [[Orlando International Airport]] and it used [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737–200]] aircraft. It ceased operations in November 2003 after Song was established.<ref>[http://www.icao.int/sta10/Docs/List_LCCs.pdf ICAO list of LCCs] retrieved August 5, 2011</ref>
* [[Song (airline)|Song]] began service on April 15, 2003 as a single-class airline operated by Delta to compete directly with [[JetBlue Airways]] from both airlines' hub at New York–JFK. While the brand was considered a successful addition to the Northeast-to-Florida market, financially the airline suffered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://knowledge.emory.edu/article.cfm?articleid=755 |title=Delta's Dilemma – Knowledge@Emory |publisher=Knowledge.emory.edu |date=March 10, 2004 |accessdate=May 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110718145954/http://knowledge.emory.edu/article.cfm?articleid=755 |archivedate=July 18, 2011 }}</ref> On May 1, 2006, Song was folded into the Delta [[Mainline (flight)|mainline]] brand.

===Branding===
Delta's current livery, "Upward & Onward", uses four colors. It features a "widget" ([[delta (letter)|delta]]) on each aircraft's vertical stabilizer to refer to Delta's origins as a carrier in the Mississippi Delta.<ref name="Mouawad1">{{cite news| author=Jad Mouawad| title=On Jet Exteriors, a Parade of Vanilla| work=The New York Times| date=23 December 2011| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/24/business/on-the-exterior-of-jetliners-a-parade-of-plain-vanilla.html?_r=1&ref=business| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref>

The previous livery, "Colors in Motion", used eight colors. Delta introduced its current branding in 2007 after it emerged from bankruptcy. The switch from the previous livery to the current livery removed one day from each aircraft's painting cycle, allowing the airline to save money. The airline took four years to repaint all of its aircraft into the current scheme, including aircraft inherited from Northwest Airlines.<ref name="Mouawad1"/> The triangle logo, known internally as "the Widget", was introduced in 1959.

* [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]]<ref name="HubCVG"/> – Prior to the merger with Northwest Airlines, Cincinnati was the second largest hub for Delta. Since the merger, service has been drastically cut, mainly due to its proximity to the Detroit hub, as well as the shutdown of [[Comair]], but it officially remains a hub.<ref name="yamanouchi">{{cite news |last=Yamanouchi |first=Kelly |url=http://www.ajc.com/business/hub-changes-hit-cincinnati-1241765.html?cxtype=ynews_rss |title=Hub changes hit Cincinnati hard |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |publisher=ajc.com |date=30 November 2011|accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

* [[Logan International Airport]]<ref name="HubBOS"/> - A hub for Delta in the second half of the 20th century and remained one until the early 2000s. In 2005, a new terminal A was built at Logan for Delta's sole use. However, when Delta went bankrupt, they leased 11 of the 22 gates in the terminal. Today, Delta still has a large share in the Boston market, with daily international flights to various cities in Central America, Canada, and major European cities, including Amsterdam, [[Heathrow Airport|London]], and Paris. They now occupy 17 of the 22 gates and have recently opened a second Sky Club location.
* [[Los Angeles International Airport]]<ref name="HubLAX"/> – Delta dismantled its Western Airlines-inherited LAX hub in the mid-1990s when it decided to relocate most of those aircraft to the US East Coast. Since that point, however, it has re-opened its hub there, mostly flying to Mexico, Florida, and Hawaii. As of May 2015, Delta captured a 17.22% passenger market share with 139 daily departures to Hawaii, Mexico, Japan, Guatemala, and some of Delta's large domestic bases throughout the United States, as well as regional service to the West Coast. LAX also remains Delta's sole transpacific gateway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawa.org/uploadedfiles/LAX/statistics/aircarrier-2014.pdf|title=Los Angeles International Airport Top 10 Carriers (2014)}}</ref>
* [[Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport]]<ref name="HubMSP"/> – Delta's third-largest hub by number of daily flights and second largest by number of seats available. Delta served 25,844,791 passengers at MSP in 2015 and accounts for more than 80% of the airports traffic. Delta serves mostly regional airports from MSP and serves most Canadian and American metropolitan areas. Delta also serves the Caribbean, Central America, Hawaii (Seasonally), Mexico, 3 year-round destinations in Europe, and Tokyo, Japan. It is also the former headquarters for Northwest Airlines.
* [[Narita International Airport]], [[Tokyo]]<ref name="HubNRT"/> – Delta's Asian hub, acquired through the merger with Northwest Airlines.
* [[Paris–Charles de Gaulle Airport]]<ref name="HubCDG"/> – Delta's other European hub. Operated in conjunction with SkyTeam partner [[Air France]].
* [[Salt Lake City International Airport]]<ref name="HubSLC"/> – Western Airlines' Salt Lake City hub operations were continued after Delta purchased Western Airlines in 1987. Salt Lake City International Airport is Delta's fourth-largest hub.
* [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]]<ref name="HubSEA"/> – Delta announced its eighth US hub on June 17, 2014 in conjunction with the launch of its new Seattle-Hong Kong service. The hub serves as Delta's main international gateway to Asia. Delta started building its international gateway in Seattle in 2011, and in 2013 began to add major domestic feeder service as well. However, the rapid expansion resulted in a turf war between Delta and hometown airline [[Alaska Airlines]].<ref name="airchive.com">{{cite web|url=http://airchive.com/blog/2014/06/17/delta-launches-seattle-hong-kong/ |title=Delta Launches Seattle-Hong Kong, and Seattle Hub - June 17, 2014 |publisher=airchive.com | accessdate=2014-06-17}}</ref>

===Former hubs===
* [[O'Hare International Airport]] – Delta operated a small hub at Chicago until the early 1990s.
* [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] – Delta, at one time, operated over 200 flights per day from DFW. At times, it was Delta's third-largest hub behind Atlanta and Cincinnati, respectively. Delta closed the hub in February 2005 due to competition with [[American Airlines]], which had their largest hub at DFW.
* [[Frankfurt Airport]] – Upon Pan American World Airways' bankruptcy, Delta acquired its Frankfurt hub and the remainder of its Atlantic Division (including the JFK Worldport). Delta closed the hub in 1997.
* [[Memphis International Airport]] – A Delta hub that was originally dismantled but regained hub status through the merger with Northwest.<ref name="mutzabaugh">{{cite news |title=Delta: 25% cut in flights will make Memphis a better hub  |author=Ben Mutzabaugh |url=http://travel.usatoday.com/flights/post/2011/03/delta-cuts-memphis/148836/ |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=March 22, 2011}}</ref> On September 3, 2013, Delta reduced its flights from Memphis to approximately 60 flights per day to remove it as a hub.<ref name=mem_close>{{cite web |url=http://www.wmctv.com/story/22499278/source-delta-airlines-to-de-hub-mem-cut-jobs-slash-flights |title=Delta Airlines to de-hub MEM, cut jobs, slash flights |work=[[WMC-TV]] |author=Nick Kenney |date=June 4, 2013 |accessdate=June 4, 2013}}</ref> In December 2014, flights were cut down to 25 daily flights to 10 destinations, fully removing the airport's hub status.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mutzabaugh|first1=Ben|title=More cuts: Is Memphis now just another city for Delta?|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/12/15/more-cuts-is-memphis-now-just-another-city-for-delta/20424023/|website=USA Today|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=22 February 2015|date=December 15, 2014}}</ref>
* [[Orlando International Airport]] – Delta built up its Orlando hub with the conjunction of [[Comair]] in the mid 1980s, and subsequently became the "Official Airline of Walt Disney World". The airport then became the hub for Delta Express and Song, before Delta pulled back mainline presence in the mid 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Change In Direction Delta Molding Orlando Hub As Southeastern Connection|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1989-12-18/business/8912163741_1_delta-orlando-aviation-authority-airline|accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref>
* [[Portland International Airport]] – Delta built up its Portland hub in the late 1980s to gain a presence in the U.S. to Asia market. The hub operated most of Delta's flights to Asia, but was slowly reduced due to the Japanese and Korean economic recession, and closed in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=David|title=A DETAILED LOOK AT DELTA AIR LINES HISTORY IN PORTLAND|url=http://www.airlinereporter.com/2011/10/a-detailed-look-at-delta-air-lines-history-in-portland-guest-blog/|website=Airline Reporter|publisher=Airline Reporter|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref>

===Air France–KLM and Alitalia joint venture===
Inherited from the Northwest-KLM relationship (which is older than any of the three major [[airline alliance]]s including SkyTeam itself), Delta has a transatlantic joint venture with [[Air France-KLM]] and Alitalia.

{{Main|Delta Air Lines fleet}}

{{As of|2013|01|}}, Delta operates a fleet of more than 800 aircraft, [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes|Boeing]], and [[McDonnell Douglas]].<ref name="statsfacts" /> The carrier operates the largest fleets of [[Airbus A330]] aircraft of any US airline. Delta also operates the largest fleets of [[Boeing 717]], [[Boeing 757]], [[Boeing 767]], [[McDonnell Douglas MD-88]], and [[McDonnell Douglas MD-90]] aircraft in the world. Prior to its 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines, Delta's fleet was made up of solely Boeing and McDonnell Douglas aircraft; Airbus aircraft from Northwest joined the fleet after the merger.

Unlike other mainline U.S. legacy carriers, Delta has decided that its best path to profitability is a strategy that utilizes older aircraft, and Delta has created a very extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them. The oldest aircraft in the fleet are the McDonnell Douglas MD-88s.<ref name=fleetage>{{cite web |url=http://www.delta.com/about_delta/corporate_information/delta_stats_facts/aircraft_fleet/index.jsp |title=Aircraft Fleet |date=March 19, 2011 |work=delta.com |publisher=Delta Air Lines, Inc |accessdate=May 12, 2011}}</ref> Delta buys older airplanes as sources for spare parts. However, Delta is replacing some of the oldest airplanes in its fleet. To replace the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]]s, MD-88s, and older A320 and 757-200 aircraft in their fleet, Delta began discussing narrowbody replacement plans with manufacturers such as Airbus, Boeing and [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] in early 2011.<ref name=narrowbodyrepl>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/12/17/351072/delta-prepares-for-full-narrowbody-analysis-in-early.html |title=Delta prepares for full narrowbody analysis in early 2011  |first=Lori |last=Ranson |date=December 17, 2011 |work=Flight International  |publisher=Reed Business Information |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vlN8ScN7 |archivedate=January 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 15, 2011 |quote=...Delta president Ed Bastian said: "We clearly need to get the DC-9s retired.

====History====
[[File:Deltaavod.jpeg|thumb|Audio Video on Demand offered domestically on select Delta aircraft]]
[[File:Delta IFE.jpg|thumb|left|Moving Map on a [[Boeing 757|757-200]].]]
In the 1960s audio programming was introduced where passengers wore headphones consisting of hollow tubes piping in music. These were installed in some Delta aircraft. Some early wide-bodied aircraft, including the [[Lockheed L-1011]], [[Boeing 767-200]], and [[767-300]] fleet, had movies projected on to the cabin bulkhead. Also during the late 1980s and early 1990s, CRT monitors over the aisles were added to the 757 fleet, making them the first narrowbody aircraft to feature video entertainment. The MD-90 introduced Delta's first IFE system with [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] monitors in 1995, and the 777 introduced Delta's first in-seat video system in 1999, initially using the [[Rockwell Collins]] Total Entertainment System. Delta's first all-digital IFE system with AVOD (Panasonic eFX) was first introduced in 2003 on Delta's former low-cost subsidiary, Song. The Rockwell Collins IFE system on the 777s was replaced by the Panasonic eFX system in 2007, followed by the Panasonic eX2 in 2011. The Panasonic eFX and eX2 systems are trademarked by Delta as '''Delta on Demand'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.delta.com/on_demand/ |title=In-flight Entertainment on your Delta flights |work= Delta Air Lines |accessdate=September 16, 2011}}</ref>

In 2012, Delta began replacing the overhead CRT monitors on the pre-merger Delta 757-200 fleet with new LCD monitors.<ref name="pvt">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-skymiles/1239128-no-ptvs-regular-pmdl-752s-new-lcds-instead-2.html |title=No PTVs for regular PMDL 752s, new LCDs instead |publisher=Flyertalk.com |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref> This was completed in late 2012.

CRT projectors were originally featured in economy class on [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767–300s]], with the international 767-300ERs also featuring ceiling-mounted CRT displays over the aisles, which have since replaced by LCD monitors, and are now in the process of being converted to the eFX2 AVOD system.

When Delta's ex-[[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] [[ETOPS]] 757s were first delivered, they featured a system made by Sony Transcom (a former subsidiary of [[Sony]] now sold to [[Rockwell Collins]]) system that was factory installed for TWA. The system featured overhead drop-down [[LCD]] monitors similar to Delta's non-Transcon 737-800s and 757-300s. Delta replaced the Sony Transcom system with the Panasonic eFX system featuring in-seat video and AVOD at the same time as the new BusinessElite seats and slimline economy class seats were installed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.delta.com/2007/08/31/enhancing-the-entertainment-experience/#comment-122 |title=Enhancing the Entertainment Experience |author=Chris Babb |date=September 2, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130514010347/http://blog.delta.com/2007/08/31/enhancing-the-entertainment-experience/ |archivedate=May 14, 2013 }}</ref>

====Current fleet====
Audio and video are available on all aircraft except for the [[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]], [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]] and MD-90, selected [[Boeing 757]], and Delta Connection aircraft. [[Boeing 777-200ER]], [[Boeing 777-200LR|777-200LR]], and 747 aircraft, along with those 767-300 and A330 aircraft that have completed cabin modifications, feature the Panasonic eX2 system. Compared to the older eFX system, this offers greater storage capacity, as well as larger personal video screens.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.shephard.co.uk/Inflight/default.aspx?Action=-1000945703&ID=32c250df-e45e-42d1-9747-bac853a0dd69|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071107110406/http://www.shephard.co.uk/Inflight/default.aspx?Action=-1000945703&ID=32c250df-e45e-42d1-9747-bac853a0dd69|archivedate=November 7, 2007|title=US majors get with the cabin-upgrade programme|accessdate=December 16, 2006|publisher=Shepard Group|date=December 16, 2006}}</ref> [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-400ER]] aircraft, selected 757-200 aircraft, as well as the remaining internationally configured [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767-300ER]] aircraft that have not completed cabin modifications, use the [[Panasonic Avionics Corporation|Panasonic]] eFX AVOD system. On these 767-300 aircraft, AVOD is available only in the Delta One class, while the system includes overhead LCD monitors and audio programming for passengers seated in the Economy cabin. The unmodified Airbus A330  aircraft feature the Panasonic 3000i [[AVOD]] system in all cabins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.net/photo/Delta-Air-Lines/Airbus-A330-323X/1934632/L/ |title=Delta A330-300 Cabin {{pipe}} |publisher=Airliners.net |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref> This system includes supplemental LCD monitors over the aisles for displaying the safety video and moving map.

Domestic [[Boeing 767|Boeing 767–300s]], [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737–700s]], as well as selected transcontinental [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757–200s]] and selected [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737–800s]] using the Panasonic eFX system, also feature live television via [[Dish Network]] in both first class and economy. Some [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800s]], as well as all [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757–300s]] feature systems with drop-down LCD displays below the overhead bins.<ref>{{cite web|last=No |first=Brisan |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/brisan/2242036182/ |title=Delta 737–800 Cabin {{pipe}} Flickr |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2007-12-09 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}</ref>

All aircraft with AVOD feature Panasonic's iXplor moving map program. 737-800s with overhead video and the coach sections of 767-300ER aircraft with overhead video feature the Rockwell Collins Airshow moving map, which is often shown during takeoff and landing. Other aircraft formerly equipped with the Rockwell Collins Airshow moving map included the Lockheed L-1011-250 and -500, [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]], and [[Boeing 767-400ER]] and [[777-200ER]]. The L-1011 and MD-11 fleet have since been retired, while the 767-400ER and 777-200ER have since had their Airshow systems replaced by the Panasonic iXplor system built into the eFX and eX2 AVOD systems.

==SkyMiles==
{{Main|SkyMiles}}
'''SkyMiles''' is the [[frequent flyer program]] for Delta Air Lines.

==Sky Clubs==
Delta Air Lines' airport lounges are called '''Sky Clubs'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delta.com/skyclub/skyclub.action|title=Delta Sky Club|work=delta.com|accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> Membership options include single visit passes and annual memberships that can be purchased with either money or miles. International business class passengers get free access. Membership can also be granted through top level Delta status or with the purchase of some American Express credit cards.

Features vary by location, but generally include free drinks (including alcoholic beverages), snacks and reading material. Wi-Fi is free for members and guests and is mostly provided in the USA by AT&T. Other benefits for Sky Club members include reciprocal lounge access with other SkyTeam members and Delta's other partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/airports-and-aircraft/delta-sky-club/perks-amenities.html#perks|title=Delta Sky Club® Perks : Delta Air Lines|publisher=}}</ref>

Originally, Delta's membership-based airport clubs were called '''Crown Room''' lounges, with Northwest's called '''WorldClubs'''.

==Environmental initiatives==
In 2008, Delta Air Lines was given an award from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Design for the Environment (DfE) program for their use of PreKote, a more environmentally friendly, non-hexavalent chromium surface pretreatment on its aircraft, replacing hazardous chemicals formerly used to improve paint adhesion and prevent corrosion. In addition, PreKote reduces water usage by two-thirds and reduces wastewater treatment.

PreKote is also saving money by reducing the time needed to paint each airplane. With time savings of eight to ten percent, it will save an estimated more than $1 million annually.<ref name="Delta Air Lines News Release">{{cite web|title=Delta Air Lines Accepts EPA Award for Use of Nontoxic Materials on Aircraft|url=http://news.delta.com/index.php?s=43&item=22|work=Delta Air Lines News Release|publisher=Delta Air Lines|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>

|[[Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport]]
|On a [[Fort Lauderdale]]–[[Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex|Dallas/Fort Worth]]- Los Angeles route, the plane crashed due to severe [[microburst]]-induced [[wind shear]]. One person on the ground was killed as the plane crossed a highway. The crash would later become the subject of a television movie. Numerous changes to pilot wind shear training, weather forecasting, and wind shear detection were made as a result of this crash.<ref name="changed">{{cite episode| title=When Weather Changed History – Delta 191 Crash| url=http://www.livedash.com/transcript/m_a_s_h-%28operation_noselift%29/4692/TVLANDP/Friday_September_3_2010/289645/|network=[[The Weather Channel]]| airdate=8 May 2010| accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref>

|Near collision with a [[Continental Airlines|Continental]] 747 carrying 418 passengers and crew. Both the Delta (London-Cincinnati) and Continental (London-Newark) were heading to the U.S. with nearly 600 people total on both aircraft. The Delta flight strayed {{convert|60|mi|km}} off course to the south from its assigned "C" track during its flight and came within {{convert|30|ft|m}} of colliding with the 747 as the L-1011 flew under it in Canadian airspace, flying on the "D" track (there are five westbound and five eastbound tracks from the United States to the United Kingdom). Had the planes actually collided, it could have tied the [[Tenerife airport disaster]] as the deadliest aviation accident in history.

===Hijackings===
[[File:Delta Security Stickers.jpg|thumb|upright|Delta Security stickers on the back of a [[passport]].]]

There have been over a dozen attempted hijackings that resulted in no injuries and the surrender of the often lone hijacker. These incidents are not included. The following are notable hijackings because of fatalities or success in forcing the aircraft to fly to another country:
* In 1968, a Delta DC-8 was hijacked to Havana, Cuba. This was the first successful hijacking to Cuba from the U.S. since 1961,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and was the start of multiple hijacking attempts to Cuba in the late 1960s. This coincided with the introduction of passenger screening using metal detectors in U.S. airports starting in the late 1960s.
* Additional hijackings that resulted in no injuries and the flight landing in Cuba include March 28, 1984 (Delta 357 New Orleans-Dallas 727),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19840328-0&lang=en|title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 727 Havana|publisher=Aviation-safety.net|date=March 28, 1984|accessdate=March 1, 2009}}</ref> August 18, 1983 (Delta 784 Miami-Tampa 727),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19830818-0&lang=en|title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 727 Havana|publisher=Aviation-safety.net|date=August 18, 1983|accessdate=March 1, 2009}}</ref> July 17, 1983 (Delta 722 Miami-Tampa 727),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19830717-0&lang=en|title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 727 Havana|publisher=Aviation-safety.net|date=July 17, 1983|accessdate=March 1, 2009}}</ref> June 11, 1979 (Delta 1061 New York LaGuardia-Fort Lauderdale L1011)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19790611-1&lang=en|title=ASN Aircraft accident Lockheed L-1011 TriStar Havana|publisher=Aviation-safety.net|date=June 11, 1979|accessdate=March 1, 2009}}</ref>
* July 31, 1972, a [[Delta Flight 841]], a Detroit to Miami DC-8 flight, was hijacked to Algiers, Algeria by 8 hijackers. The aircraft stopped in Boston to pick up an international navigator.
