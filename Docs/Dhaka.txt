The city hosted two major [[caravansary|caravansaries]] of the subcontinent: the [[Bara Katra]] and [[Choto Katra]], located on the riverfront of the Buriganga. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid out gardens, tombs, mosques, palaces and forts.

In 1793, Dhaka was ceded to the [[British East India Company]]. British Dacca developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the establishment of railways, [[jute trade|jute trading]] and various educational and cultural institutions. It was the capital of British [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]] between 1905 and 1912. After the [[Partition of British India]] in 1947, Dhaka became the administrative capital of [[East Pakistan]]. Due to major political, economic and cultural frictions between East and [[West Pakistan]], the city was subjected to long periods of [[martial law]] and [[Operation Searchlight|military suppression]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. After independence, Dhaka witnessed rapid urban growth as the centre of [[Politics of Bangladesh|political]], [[Economy of Bangladesh|economic]] and [[Culture of Bangladesh|cultural]] life in Bangladesh.<ref>{{cite web|author=Md Mashrur Rahman Mishu .|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=149689 |title=Historic Dhaka city: Past glory and present crisis |publisher=Archive.thedailystar.net |date=7 August 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Shay |first=Christopher |url=http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20110815-saving-dhakas-heritage |title=Travel - Saving Dhaka's heritage: History, Bangladesh |publisher=BBC |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The origins of the name for Dhaka are uncertain. Once ''[[Butea frondosa|dhak]]'' tree was very common in the area and the name may have originated from it. Alternatively, this name may refer to ''the hidden goddess'' [[Dhakeshwari]], whose shrine is located in the south-western part of the city.<ref name="Britannica-Dhaka">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/160598/Dhaka|publisher=britannica.com|title=Dhaka|accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref> Another popular theory states that Dhaka refers to a [[membranophone]] instrument, ''[[Dhak (instrument)|dhak]]'' which was played by order of [[Subahdar]] [[Islam Khan I]] during the inaugurating of the Bengal capital in 1610.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Islam_Khan_Chisti|publisher=[[Banglapedia]]|title=Islam Khan Chisti|accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref> Some references also say that it was derived from a [[Prakrit]] dialect called Dhaka Bhasa; or Dhakka, used in the [[Rajtarangini]] for a watch-station; or it is the same as Davaka, mentioned in the [[Allahabad]] pillar inscription of [[Samudragupta]] as an eastern frontier kingdom.<ref name="banglapedia">{{cite web |last=Chowdhury |first=A.M. |publisher=Banglapedia |date=23 April 2007 |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Dhaka |title=Dhaka |accessdate=23 April 2007}}</ref>

[[File:DhakaCity1861.png|thumb|Dhaka, or Dacca, under [[British Raj|British rule]] in 1861]]Dhaka suffered stagnation and decline during the early 19th-century.

=== Parks and recreation ===

There are many parks within Dhaka city, including [[Ramna Park]], [[Suhrawardy Udyan]], [[Shishu Park]], [[National Botanical Garden of Bangladesh|National Botanical Garden]], [[Baldha Garden]], [[Chandrima Uddan]], Gulshan Park and [[Dhaka Zoo]]. There are lakes within city, such as Crescent lake, [[Dhanmondi]] lake, [[Baridhara]]-[[Gulshan, Dhaka|Gulshan]] lake, [[Banani]] lake, [[Uttara Thana|Uttara]] lake and [[Hatirjheel]]-Begunbari lake.

Hatirjheel-Begunbari is a new place of recreation for city dwellers. Hatirjheel covering {{convert|320|acres|0|abbr=on}} is transformed into a place of festivity at night but with serenity settling down. Consultants from [[Department of Civil Engineering, BUET|Civil Engineering Department]] of [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology|BUET]] and engineers of SWO of [[Bangladesh Army]], [[Roads and Highways in Bangladesh|Roads and Highways Department]], [[Local Government Engineering Department]] and [[Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha]] have worked hard to turn this project into reality. However, the parks and the recreation places are often crowded and lacks security and cleanliness aspects, which is yet one of the big issues.

==Government==

===Capital city===
[[File:National Assembly of Bangladesh (09).jpg|thumb|352x352px|[[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban|National Parliament House]]]]
As the capital of the [[People's Republic of Bangladesh]], Dhaka is the home to numerous state and diplomatic institutions. The [[Bangabhaban]] is the official residence and workplace of the [[President of Bangladesh]], who is the ceremonial head of state under the [[Constitution of Bangladesh|constitution]]. The [[Jatiyo Sangshad Bhaban|National Parliament House]] is located in the modernist capital complex designed by [[Louis Kahn]] in [[Sher-e-Bangla Nagar]]. The [[Gonobhaban]], the official residence of the [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]], is situated on the north side of Parliament. The Prime Minister's Office is located in Tejgaon. Most ministries of the [[Government of Bangladesh]] are housed in the Bangladesh Secretariat. The [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|Supreme Court]], the [[Dhaka High Court]] and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bangladesh)|Foreign Ministry]] are located in the Ramna area. The [[Ministry of Defence (Bangladesh)|Defence Ministry]] and the [[Bangladesh Armed Forces]] headquarters are located in Dhaka Cantonment.

Dhaka hosts [[List of diplomatic missions in Bangladesh|48 resident embassies and high commissions]] and numerous [[international organisations]]. Most diplomatic missions are located in North Dhaka. The [[Agargaon]] area near Parliament is home to the country offices of the United Nations, the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[Islamic Development Bank]].

===Civic administration===
The Dhaka municipality was founded on 1 August 1864, and upgraded to "[[municipal corporation|Corporation]]" status in 1978. The [[Dhaka City Corporation]] is a self-governing corporation which runs the affairs of the city. Recently (i.e. 2011), Dhaka City Corporation has been divided into two administrative parts&nbsp;– these are (1) [[Dhaka North City Corporation]] and (2) [[Dhaka South City Corporation]] – for ensuring better civic facilities. These two corporations are headed by two administrators. The incorporated area is divided into several wards, which have elected commissioners. The [[Dhaka Education Board]] is responsible for administering all [[Education in Bangladesh|public schools]] and most private schools except for English-medium schools and [[madrasah|madrassahs]].<ref name="eduact">{{cite web|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=318&sections_id=15928&vol=13&search=Education%20Ordinance,%201961|title=East Pakistan Intermediate and Secondary Education Ordinance, 1961 (East Pakistan Ordinance No. XXX population III of 1961)|accessdate=31 March 2009 |publisher=Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Bangladesh }}</ref><ref name='moe'>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationboard.gov.bd/ |title=Education Board Bangladesh |accessdate=31 March 2009 |publisher=Ministry of Education, Intermediate and Secondary Education Boards, Bangladesh }}</ref> All madrassahs in Bangladesh are governed by a central board while English-medium schools are under separate educational and governance structures.<ref name='maddrassahact'>{{cite web|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/sections_detail.php?id=566&sections_id=7748&vol=21|title=THE MADRASAH EDUCATION ORDINANCE, 1978 (ORDINANCE NO.
