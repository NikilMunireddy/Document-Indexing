IBM Israel, registered on June 8, 1950, was the country's first high-tech firm. The company, located on Allenby Street in Tel Aviv, assembled and repaired punch card machines, sorting machines and tabulators. In 1956, a local plant was opened to produce punch cards, and a year later, the first service center opened, offering computerized data processing services.

In 1952, Thomas Watson, Sr., stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm; his son, [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]], was named president. In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of  [[artificial intelligence]] when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an [[IBM 704]] not merely to play checkers but "learn" from its own experience.  In 1957, the [[FORTRAN]] (FORmula TRANslation) scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, Thomas J. Watson, Jr., was elected chairman of the board and [[Albert L. Williams]] became company president. The same year IBM developed the SABRE (Semi-Automatic Business-Related Environment) reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful [[IBM Selectric typewriter|Selectric]] typewriter.

In 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to [[Armonk, New York]]. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission.

On April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the revolutionary [[IBM System/360]]. Sold between 1964 and 1978, it spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their application.

In 1974, IBM engineer [[George J. Laurer]] developed the [[Universal Product Code]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cummingsdesign.com/bar_code_history.htm |title=The history of the UPC bar code and how the bar code symbol and system became a world standard. |author= |work= |publisher=Cummingsdesign |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> On October 11, 1973, IBM introduced the IBM 3666, a laser-scanning point-of-sale barcode reader which would become the backbone of retail checkouts. On June 26, 1974, at Marsh's supermarket in Troy, Ohio, a pack of [[Wrigley Company|Wrigley's]] [[Juicy Fruit|Juicy Fruit chewing gum]] was the first-ever product scanned. It is now on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution’s]] [[Smithsonian National Museum of American History|National Museum of American History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

In the late 1970s, IBM underwent a wave of internal convulsions between a management faction wanting to concentrate on its bread-and-butter mainframe business and one desiring to expand into the emerging personal computer industry.

In 2002, IBM acquired [[PwC]] consulting. In 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values. Using its ''Jam'' technology, it hosted a three-day Internet-based online discussion of key [[business]] issues with 50,000 employees. Results were data mined with sophisticated text analysis software (eClassifier) for common themes. Three emerged, expressed as: "Dedication to every client's success", "Innovation that matters—for our company and for the world", and "Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/sjp/04-27-2004.html%7ctitle=Speeches%7cpublisher=IBM%7cdate=2004-04-27|title=IBM About IBM - United States|publisher=|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}</ref> Another three-day Jam took place in 2004, with 52,000 employees discussing ways to implement company values [[best practice|in practice]].<ref>{{cite journal

==Work environment==
IBM's employee management practices can be traced back to its roots. In 1914, CEO Thomas J. Watson boosted company spirit by creating employee sports teams, hosting family outings, and furnishing a company band. IBM sports teams still continue in the present day; the IBM Big Blue continue to exist as semi-professional company [[IBM Big Blue (rugby union)|rugby]] and [[IBM Big Blue (X-League)|American football]] teams. In 1924 the Quarter Century Club, which recognizes employees with 25 years of service, was organized and the first issue of ''Business Machines'', IBM's internal publication, was published. In 1925, the first meeting of the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

IBM was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935) and paid vacations (1937). In 1932 IBM created an Education Department to oversee training for employees, which oversaw the completion of the IBM Schoolhouse at Endicott in 1933. In 1935, the employee magazine ''Think'' was created. Also that year, IBM held its first training class for female systems service professionals. In 1942, IBM launched a program to train and employ disabled people in Topeka, Kansas. The next year classes began in New York City, and soon the company was asked to join the President's Committee for Employment of the Handicapped. In 1946, the company hired its first black salesman, 18 years before the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].  In 1947, IBM announced a Total and Permanent Disability Income Plan for employees. A vested rights pension was added to the IBM retirement plan.  During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s revisions were made to these pension plans to reduce IBM's pension liabilities.<ref>{{cite book |title= Retirement Heist: How Companies Plunder and Profit From The Nest Eggs Of American Workers |last=Schultz |first= Ellen E.|year= 2011 |publisher=[[Penguin Group]] |pages=39–75}}</ref>

In 1952, Thomas J. Watson, Jr., published the company's first written equal opportunity policy letter, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education and 11 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1961, IBM's nondiscrimination policy was expanded to include sex, national origin, and age. The following year, IBM hosted its first Invention Award Dinner honoring 34 outstanding IBM inventors; and in 1963, the company named the first eight [[IBM Fellow]]s in a new Fellowship Program that recognizes senior IBM scientists, engineers and other professionals for outstanding technical achievements.
[[File:IBMtricycleJohannesburg1965.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An IBM delivery tricycle in [[Johannesburg, South Africa]] in 1965]]
On September 21, 1953, [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]], the company's president at the time, sent out a controversial letter to all IBM employees stating that IBM needed to hire the best people, regardless of their race, ethnic origin, or gender. He also publicized the policy so that in his negotiations to build new manufacturing plants with the governors of two states in the U.S. South, he could be clear that IBM would not build "[[separate but equal|separate-but-equal]]" workplaces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/employment/us/diverse/50/tc.shtml|title=IBM's EO Policy letter is IBM's foundation for diversity|publisher=IBM}}</ref> In 1984, IBM added sexual orientation to its nondiscrimination policy. The company stated that this would give IBM a competitive advantage because IBM would then be able to hire talented people its competitors would turn down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/employment/us/diverse/heritage_ibm_1980.shtml|title=IBM Valuing Diversity: Heritage - 1980s|publisher=IBM}}</ref>

IBM was the only technology company ranked in ''Working Mother'' magazine's Top 10 for 2004, and one of two technology companies in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workingwoman.com/top10.html |title=100 best companies for working mothers 2004 |publisher=Working Mother Media, Inc. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041017073511/http://www.workingwoman.com/top10.html |archivedate=2004-10-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.workingwoman.com/top10.html |title=100 best companies 2005 |publisher=Working Mother Media, Inc.|accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> On October 10, 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use [[genetic testing|genetic information]] in employment decisions. The announcement was made shortly after IBM began working with the [[National Geographic Society]] on its [[Genographic Project]].

IBM provides same-sex partners of its employees with [[Health insurance|health benefits]] and provides an anti-discrimination clause. The [[Human Rights Campaign]] has consistently rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness since 2003 (in 2002, the year it began compiling its report on major companies, IBM scored 86%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Search_the_Database&Template=/CustomSource/WorkNet/srch_dtl.cfm&srchtype=QS&searchid=34&orgid=1238|title=International Business Machines Corp.

Following in the footsteps of other big companies like Adobe and Accenture, IBM got rid of its annual performance review system in February 2016. Now, through the "Checkpoint" system, official feedback is given on at least a quarterly basis - and it's supplemented by a more casual, ongoing dialogue between employees. This dialogue takes place virtually, through an IBM mobile and desktop app called "ACE," which stands for "Appreciation, Coaching, Evaluation." The app is an optional tool, and so far 90,000 IBM staffers are using it.<ref>Shana Lebowitz, Business Insider. “[http://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-now-uses-the-ace-app-to-give-and-receive-real-time-feedback-2016-5 After overhauling its performance review system, IBM now uses an app to give and receive real-time feedback].” May 20, 2016.

[[File:IBM Anechoic chamber.jpg|thumb|left|250x|An [[anechoic chamber]] inside [[IBM Yamato Facility|IBM's Yamato research facility]]]]
In 1945, The Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side was used as IBM's first laboratory devoted to pure science. It was the forerunner of [[IBM Research]], the largest [[R&D|industrial research]] organization in the world, with twelve labs on six continents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/|title=IBM  Research: Global labs|publisher=|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}</ref>

In 1966, IBM researcher Robert H. Dennard invented dynamic random access memory (DRAM) cells, one-transistor memory cells that store each single bit of information as an electrical charge in an electronic circuit. The technology permits major increases in memory density and is widely adopted throughout the industry where it remains in widespread use today.

IBM has been a leading proponent of the [[Open Source Initiative]], and began supporting [[Linux]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/news/1999/03/02.phtml |title=IBM launches biggest Linux lineup ever |date=1999-03-02 |publisher=IBM |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991110114228/http://www.ibm.com/news/1999/03/02.phtml |archivedate=1999-11-10}}</ref> The company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on Linux through the IBM [[Linux Technology Center]], which includes over 300 [[Linux kernel]] developers.<ref>{{cite web|title=IBM invests in Brazil Linux Tech Center|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/185602/|date=2006-05-24|publisher=[[LWN.net]]|author=Farrah Hamid}}</ref> IBM has also released code under different [[open source license]]s, such as the [[Cross-platform|platform-independent]] [[software framework]] [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]] (worth approximately US$40 million at the time of the donation),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-erick.html|title=Interview: The Eclipse code donation|date=2001-11-01|publisher=IBM}}</ref> the three-sentence [http://source.icu-project.org/repos/icu/icu/trunk/license.html International Components for Unicode] ([[International Components for Unicode|ICU]]) license, and the [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based [[relational database management system]] (RDBMS) [[Apache Derby]]. IBM's [[open source]] involvement has not been trouble-free, however (see ''[[SCO v. IBM]]'').

In 2013, Booz and Company (now known as [[Strategy&]], a subsidiary of [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]) placed IBM sixteenth among the 20 most innovative companies in the world. The company spends 6% of its revenue ($6.3 billion) in research and development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.challenges.fr/galeries-photos/galeries-photos/20111028.CHA6249/facebook-entre-dans-le-classement-des-10-entreprises-les-plus-innovantes.html#photo|title=Le top 20 des entreprises les plus innovantes du monde|publisher=Challenges|date=22 October 2013}}</ref>

IBM announced it will launch its new software, called "Open Client Offering" which is to run on [[Linux]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and Apple's [[Mac OS X]]. The company states that its new product allows businesses to offer employees a choice of using the same software on Windows and its alternatives. This means that "Open Client Offering" is to cut costs of managing whether to use Linux or Apple relative to Windows. There will be no necessity for companies to pay Microsoft for its licenses for operating systems since the operating systems will no longer rely on software which is Windows-based. One alternative to Microsoft's office document formats is the [[OpenDocument|Open Document Format]] software, whose development IBM supports. It is going to be used for several tasks like: [[word processing]], presentations, along with collaboration with [[IBM Lotus Notes|Lotus Notes]], [[instant messaging]] and blog tools as well as an [[Internet Explorer]] competitor&nbsp;– the [[Mozilla Firefox]] web browser. IBM plans to install Open Client on 5% of its desktop PCs.  The Linux offering has been made available as the IBM Client for Smart Work product on the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/openclient/ |title=IBM Client for Smart Work |publisher=01.ibm.com |accessdate=2010-05-23}}</ref>

In January 2014, IBM announced plans to invest more than $1.2bn (£735m) into its data centers and cloud storage business. It plans to build 15 new centers around the world, bringing the total number up to 40 during 2014.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25773266 | work=BBC News | title=IBM commits .2bn to cloud data centre expansion | date=17 January 2014}}</ref>

In July 2014, the company revealed it was investing $3 billion over the following five years to create computer functionality to resemble how the human brain thinks. A spokesman said that basic computer architecture had not altered since the 1940s. IBM says its goal is to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power.<ref name="BrainIBM">{{cite news|title=New research initiative sees IBM commit $3 bn|url=http://www.sanfrancisconews.net/index.php/sid/223650653/scat/3a8a80d6f705f8cc/ht/New-research-initiative-sees-IBM-commit-3-bn|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=''San Francisco News.Net''}}</ref>

==Environmental record==
IBM was recognized as one of the "Top 20 Best Workplaces for Commuters" by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in 2005. The award was to recognize [[Fortune 500]] companies which provided employees with excellent commuter benefits to help reduce traffic and air pollution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/responsibility/world/environmental/index.shtml|title=Environmental Protection|date=3 May 2008|publisher=IBM}}</ref>

The birthplace of IBM, [[Endicott, New York|Endicott]], [[Endicott, New York#Pollution|suffered pollution for decades]], however. IBM used liquid cleaning agents in [[Printed circuit board|circuit board]] assembly operation for more than two decades, and six spills and leaks were recorded, including one leak in 1979 of 4,100&nbsp;gallons from an underground tank. These left behind [[volatile organic compound]]s in the town's soil and aquifer. Traces of volatile organic compounds have been identified in Endicott’s drinking water, but the levels are within regulatory limits. Also, from 1980, IBM has pumped out 78,000&nbsp;gallons of chemicals, including [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|trichloroethane]], [[freon]], [[benzene]] and [[Tetrachloroethylene|perchloroethene]] to the air and allegedly caused several cancer cases among the townspeople. IBM Endicott has been identified by the Department of Environmental Conservation as the major source of pollution, though traces of contaminants from a local dry cleaner and other polluters were also found. Remediation and testing are ongoing,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/47783.html|title=Village of Endicott Environmental Investigations|accessdate=28 January 2015}}</ref> however  according to city officials, tests show that the water is safe to drink.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E4DF1631F936A25750C0A9629C8B63&fta=y|title=In an I.B.M.

Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Co., Ltd. (TOK) and IBM are collaborating to establish new, low-cost methods for bringing the next generation of [[Solar power|solar energy]] products, called [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (Copper-Indium-Gallium-Selenide) [[solar cell]] modules, to market. Use of [[thin film]] technology, such as CIGS, has great promise in reducing the overall cost of solar cells and further enabling their widespread adoption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tok.co.jp/en/news/2008/pdf/080616.pdf|title=IBM and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo Turn Up Watts on Solar Energy Production|publisher=tok.co.jp|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/green/index.shtml |title=Energy, the environment and IBM. |publisher=IBM |date=2008-04-01 |accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref>

IBM is exploring four main areas of photovoltaic research: using current technologies to develop cheaper and more efficient [[silicon]] solar cells, developing new solution-processed thin film photovoltaic devices, [[concentrating solar power|concentrator photovoltaics]], and future generation photovoltaic architectures based upon [[nanostructure]]s such as semiconductor [[quantum dot]]s and [[nanowire]]s.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/24203.wss |title=IBM Press room - 2008-05-15 IBM Research Unveils Breakthrough In Solar Farm Technology - United States |publisher=IBM |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2009-05-27}}</ref>

==Company logo and nickname==
[[File:Original IBM Logo.png|thumb|right|150px|The company used the "globe" logo until 1947, when it began using an acronym-based logo.]]
IBM's current "8-bar" [[logo]] was designed in 1972 by [[graphic designer]] [[Paul Rand]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/logo/logo_8.html|title=IBM Archives|publisher=IBM}}</ref> It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo that first appeared in public on the 1966 release of the TSS/360. Logos designed in the 1970s tended to reflect the inability of period photocopiers to render large areas well, hence discrete horizontal bars.

In 1990 company scientists used a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] to arrange 35 [[IBM (atoms)|individual xenon atoms]] to spell out the company acronym.  It was the first structure assembled one atom at a time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/vintage/vintage_4506VV1003.html|title=IBM Archives: "IBM" atoms|publisher=IBM}}</ref>

''Big Blue'' is a nickname for IBM derived in the 1960s from the company's blue logo and color scheme, originally adopted in 1947. ''True Blue'' referred to a loyal IBM customer, and business writers later picked up the term.<ref name="Big Blue">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Da1bPYRyltMC&pg=PA228&lpg=PA228&dq=big+blue+ibm|title=Postphenomenology: A Critical Companion to Ihde |page=228|isbn=0-7914-6787-2|year=2006|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|author=edited by Evan Selinger.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5zAW7RntiD8C&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=big+blue+ibm|title=Logos, Letterheads & Business Cards: Design for Profit |page=15|isbn=2-88046-750-0|year=2004|publisher=Rotovision|author=Conway Lloyd Morgan and Chris Foges.}}</ref> IBM once had a de facto [[dress code]] that saw many IBM employees wear white shirts with blue suits.<ref name="Big Blue"/><ref>{{cite book|page=55|title=The Essential Guide to Computing: The Story of Information Technology|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AwrQsOW5SsQC&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=big+blue+ibm|publisher=Publisher: Prentice Hall PTR|isbn=0-13-019469-7|author=E.
