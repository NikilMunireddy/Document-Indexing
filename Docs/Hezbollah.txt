===1980s===
{{Main|Lebanese civil war|South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)}}
Hezbollah emerged in [[South Lebanon]] during a consolidation of [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia]] militias as a rival to the older [[Amal Movement]]. Hezbollah played a significant role in the [[Lebanese civil war]], opposing [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|American forces in 1982–83]] and opposing Amal and [[Syria]] during the 1985–88 [[War of the Camps]]. However, Hezbollah's early primary focus was ending [[Israel]]'s occupation of southern Lebanon<ref name="bbc-hi-me"/> following Israel's [[1982 Lebanon War|1982 invasion]] and siege of [[Beirut]].<ref>Avi Shlaim (2001) ''The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World'' W.W.

In 2006, former [[Israeli prime minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] stated, "When we entered Lebanon ... there was no Hezbollah. We were accepted with perfumed rice and flowers by the Shia in the south.

===After 1990===
In the 1990s, Hezbollah transformed from a revolutionary group into a political one, in a process which is described as the Lebanonisation of Hezbollah. Unlike its uncompromising revolutionary stance in the 1980s, Hezbollah conveyed a lenient stance towards the Lebanese state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a784386222~db=all |publisher=''Mediterranean Politics'', Volume 3, Issue 1 Summer 1998, pages 103–134 |title=The strategy and tactics of Hizballah's current 'Lebanonization process}}</ref>

In 1992 Hezbollah decided to participate in elections, and [[Ali Khamenei]], [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader of Iran]], endorsed it. Former Hezbollah secretary general, [[Subhi al-Tufayli]], contested this decision, which led to a schism in Hezbollah. Hezbollah won all twelve seats which were on its electoral list. At the end of that year, Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians. Hezbollah regards cultural, political, and religious freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified, although it does not extend these values to groups who have relations with Israel.<ref>Alagha (2006), pp. 41–44</ref>

In 1997 Hezbollah formed the multi-confessional Lebanese Brigades to Fighting the Israeli Occupation in an attempt to revive national and secular resistance against Israel, thereby marking the "Lebanonisation" of resistance.<ref>Alagha (2006), p. 47</ref>

The Lebanese ''Daily Star'' newspaper reported on April 14, 2014 that three Hezbollah members had been arrested in [[Thailand]]. The information was obtained from a specialist Thai intelligence website that identified a Thai citizen, Y. Ayyad, described as a Hezbollah member working out of a unit in East Asia, while the two Lebanese nationals that were arrested, D. Farhat and B. Bahsoun, were considered "suspects."<ref>{{cite news|title=Hezbollah members arrested in Thailand: report|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2014/Apr-14/253310-hezbollah-members-arrested-in-thailand-report.ashx#axzz2z29Y4m35|accessdate=16 April 2014|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=14 April 2014}}</ref>

===Islamic Jihad Organization (IJO)===
Whether the [[Islamic Jihad Organization]] (IJO) was a ''[[nom de guerre]]'' used by Hezbollah or a separate organization, is disputed. According to certain sources, IJO was identified as merely a "telephone organization,"<ref>Marius Deeb, Militant Islamic Movements in Lebanon: Origins, Social Basis, and Ideology, Occasional Paper Series (Washington, DC, Georgetown University, 1986) p.19</ref><ref>al-Nahar, September 7, 1985</ref> and<ref>LaRevue du Liban, July 27,  – August 3, 1985</ref> whose name was "used by those involved to disguise their true identity."<ref>''al-Nahar al-Arabi'', June 10</ref><ref>''Ma'aretz'', December 16, 1983</ref><ref>''Le Point'', July 30, 1987</ref><ref>''al-Shira'', August 28, 1988</ref><ref>''Nouveau Magazine'', July 23, 1988</ref> Hezbollah reportedly also used another name, "Islamic Resistance" (''al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya''), for attacks against Israel.<ref>Ranstorp, Hizb'allah'' (1997), p.67</ref>

==Ideology==
{{Main|Ideology of Hezbollah}}

Back in the 1980s, the ideology of Hezbollah was described as radical. It is presented in the [[#1985 manifesto|1985 manifesto]]. The first objective was [[Anti-imperialism|fighting against American and Israeli imperialism]], freedom of the [[Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon|occupied Southern Lebanon]] and all other occupied territories. The second objective was to gather all Muslims in the concept of [[ummah]]; then Lebanon would continue the [[1979 Revolution]] of Iran. It also declared it would protect all Lebanese communities except the ones which collaborated with Israel, and supported all national movements—Muslim or non-Muslim—throughout the world. The Ideology has been changed, and today Hezbollah is a left-wing political entity focused on [[social injustice]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Engeland|first1=Dr Anisseh Van|last2=Rudolph|first2=Ms Rachael M|title=From Terrorism to Politics|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9781409498704|page=36}}</ref>

==Organization==
[[File:HezbollahOrgChart.svg|thumb|Organizational chart of Hezbollah, by Ahmad Nizar Hamzeh.]]

At the beginning many Hezbollah leaders have maintained that the movement was "not an organization, for its members carry no cards and bear no specific responsibilities,"<ref>''al-Nahar al-Arabi walduwali'', June 10–16, 1985; and ''La Revue du Liban'', July 27 – August 3, 1985. quoted in Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p.41</ref> and that the movement does not have "a clearly defined organizational structure."<ref>Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p. 64</ref> Nowadays, as Hezbollah scholar [[Magnus Ranstorp]] reports, Hezbollah does indeed have a formal governing structure, and in keeping with the principle of [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists]] (''velayat-e faqih''), it "concentrate[s]&nbsp;... all authority and powers" in its religious leaders, whose decisions then "flow from the [[Ulema|ulama]] down the entire community."

<blockquote>The supreme decision-making bodies of the Hezbollah were divided between the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Assembly) which was headed by 12 senior clerical members with responsibility for tactical decisions and supervision of overall Hizballah activity throughout Lebanon, and the Majlis al-Shura al-Karar (the Deciding Assembly), headed by Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah and composed of eleven other clerics with responsibility for all strategic matters. Within the Majlis al-Shura, there existed seven specialized committees dealing with ideological, financial, military and political, judicial, informational and social affairs. In turn, the Majlis al-Shura and these seven committees were replicated in each of Hizballah's three main operational areas (the [[Beqaa Governorate|Beqaa]], [[Beirut]], and the South).<ref name="Ranstorp-p45">Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p. 45</ref></blockquote>

Since the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] is the ultimate clerical authority, Hezbollah's leaders have appealed to him "for guidance and directives in cases when Hezbollah's collective leadership [was] too divided over issues and fail[ed] to reach a consensus."<ref name="Ranstorp-p45" /> After the death of Iran's first Supreme Leader, Khomeini, Hezbollah's governing bodies developed a more "independent role" and appealed to Iran less often.<ref name="Ranstorp-p45" /> Since the [[Second Lebanon War]], however, [[Iran]] has restructured Hezbollah to limit the power of [[Hassan Nasrallah]], and invested billions of dollars "rehabilitating" Hezbollah.<ref>Nahmias, Roee.

Structurally, Hezbollah does not distinguish between its political/social activities within Lebanon and its military/''jihad'' activities against Israel. "Hezbollah has a single leadership," according to [[Naim Qassem]], Hezbollah's second in command. "All political, social and jihad work is tied to the decisions of this leadership&nbsp;... The same leadership that directs the parliamentary and government work also leads jihad actions in the struggle against Israel."<ref>Daragahi, Borzou.

April 17, 2009.</ref>

Hezbollah's secret services have been described as "one of the best in the world", and have even infiltrated the [[Israeli army]]. Hezbollah's secret services collaborate with the [[:Category:Lebanese intelligence agencies|Lebanese intelligence agencies]].<ref name=Engeland33/>

In the summer of 1982, Hezbollah's Special Security Apparatus was created by Hussein al-Khalil, now a "top political adviser to Nasrallah,"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Masters|first1=Jonathan|last2=Laub|first2=Zachary|title=Hezbollah (a.k.a.

By 2008, scholar Carl Anthony Wege writes, "Hizballah had obtained complete dominance over Lebanon’s official state counterintelligence apparatus, which now constituted a Hizballah asset for counterintelligence purposes." This close connection with Lebanese intelligence helped bolster Hezbollah's financial counterintelligence unit.<ref name="Wege">{{cite journal|last1=Wege|first1=Carl Anthony|title=Hizballah's Counterintelligence Apparatus|journal=International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence|date=2012|volume=25|issue=4|pages=771–785|doi=10.1080/08850607.2012.705185|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850607.2012.705185?journalCode=ujic20}}</ref>{{rp|772, 775}}

According to Ahmad Hamzeh, Hezbollah's counterintelligence service is divided into ''Amn al-Muddad'', responsible for "external" or "encounter" security; and ''Amn al-Hizb'', which protects the organization's integrity and its leaders. According to Wege, ''Amn al-Muddad'' "may have received specialized intelligence training in Iran and possibly North Korea".<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|773–774}} The organization also includes a military security component, as well as an External Security Organization (''al-Amn al-Khariji'' or Unit 910) that operates covertly outside Lebanon.<ref name="Wege2" />{{rp|238}}

Successful Hezbollah counterintelligence operations include thwarting the [[CIA]]'s attempted kidnapping of foreign operations chief Hassan Ezzeddine in 1994; the 1997 manipulation of a double agent that led to the [[Shayetet 13#Ansariya Ambush|Ansariya Ambush]]; and the 2000 kidnapping of alleged Mossad agent Elhanan Tannenbaum.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|773}} Hezbollah also collaborated with the Lebanese government in 2006 to detect Adeeb al-Alam, a former colonel, as an Israeli spy.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|774}} Also, the organization recruited IDF Lieutenant Colonel Omar al-Heib, who was convicted in 2006 of conducting surveillance for Hezbollah.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|776}} In 2009, Hezbollah apprehended Marwan Faqih, a garage owner who installed tracking devices in Hezbollah-owned vehicles.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|774}}

Hezbollah's counterintelligence apparatus also uses electronic surveillance and intercept technologies. By 2011, Hezbollah counterintelligence began to use software to analyze cellphone data and detect espionage; suspicious callers were then subjected to conventional surveillance. In the mid-1990s, Hezbollah was able to "download unencrypted video feeds from Israeli drones," and Israeli [[SIGINT]] efforts intensified after the 2000 withdrawal from Lebanon. With possible help from Iran and the [[Russia]]n [[Federal Security Service|FSB]], Hezbollah augmented its electronic counterintelligence capabilities, and succeeded by 2008 in detecting Israeli bugs near Mount Sannine and in the organization's fiber optic network.<ref name="Wege" />{{rp|774, 777–778}}

The '''Lebanese Resistance Brigades''' ({{lang-ar|سرايا المقاومة اللبنانية}} ''Saraya al-Moukawama al-Lubnaniyya''), also known as the '''Lebanese Brigades to Resist the Israeli Occupation''', were formed by Hezbollah in 1997 as a multifaith (Christian, Druze, Sunni and Shia) volunteer force to combat the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon. With the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000, the organization was disbanded.<ref>{{cite book |last=Blanford |first=Nicholas |date=2011 |title=Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lJWGvIcmODoC&pg=PT582&lpg=PT582&dq=resistance+brigades+lebanon+2008&source=bl&ots=zz1p0_fchZ&sig=5m78C7PMm7L9DlJnTqvNBxXOLZs&hl=es&sa=X&ei=_MxbU_n2Juia0QXsiYHoBw&ved=0CG8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=resistance%20brigades%20lebanon%202008&f=false |location=New York |publisher=[[Random House]] |page=582 |isbn=978-0-679-60516-4 |accessdate=26 April 2014 }}</ref>

In 2009, the Resistance Brigades were reactivated, mainly comprising [[Sunni]] supporters from the southern city of [[Sidon]]. Its strength was reduced in late 2013 from 500 to 200–250 due to residents complaints about some fighters of the group exacerbating tensions with the local community.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wariness of Resistance Brigades grows in Sidon|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2013/Nov-13/237718-wariness-of-resistance-brigades-grows-in-sidon.ashx#axzz2zozaKG9W|work=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]|date=13 November 2013|accessdate=26 April 2014}}</ref>

====South Lebanon conflict====
{{Main|South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)}}
Hezbollah has been involved in several cases of armed conflict with Israel:

* During the [[1982–2000 South Lebanon conflict]], Hezbollah waged a guerrilla campaign against Israeli forces occupying [[Southern Lebanon]]. In 1982, the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) was based in Southern Lebanon and was firing Katyusha rockets into northern Israel from Lebanon. Israel invaded Lebanon to evict the PLO, and Hezbollah became an armed organization to expel the Israelis.<ref name="In the Party of God" /> Hezbollah's strength was enhanced by the dispatching of one thousand to two thousand members of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps|Iranian Revolutionary Guards]] and the financial backing of Iran.<ref name="lebarmy6915">{{cite web|url=http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/article.asp?ln=en&id=6915 |author=Nizar Abdel-Kader |publisher=Lebanese Army Magazine |title=Iraq and the Future of Gulf Security Cooperation: A Lebanese perspective |accessdate=July 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060404030400/http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb:80/article.asp?ln=en&id=6915 |archivedate=April 4, 2006 }}</ref><ref>Third World Quarterly, Vol 14, No 2, 1993, reprinted at Al Mashriq [http://almashriq.hiof.no/ddc/projects/pspa/hamzeh2.html Lebanon's Hizbullah: from Islamic revolution to parliamentary accommodation] Accessed July 26, 2006</ref><ref>Rex A.

{{main|Assassination of Rafic Hariri}}
On February 14, 2005, former Lebanese Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]] was killed, along with 21 others, when his motorcade was struck by a roadside bomb in Beirut. He had been PM during 1992–1998 and 2000–2004. In 2009, the United Nations special tribunal investigating the murder of Hariri reportedly found evidence linking Hezbollah to the murder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,626412,00.html|title=New Evidence Points to Hezbollah in Hariri Murder|first=Erich|last=Follath|work=Der Spiegel}}</ref>

In August 2010, in response to notification that the UN tribunal would indict some Hezbollah members, [[Hassan Nasrallah]] said Israel was looking for a way to assassinate Hariri as early as 1993 in order to create political chaos that would force Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, and to perpetuate an anti-Syrian atmosphere [in Lebanon] in the wake of the assassination. He went on to say that in 1996 Hezbollah apprehended an agent working for Israel by the name of Ahmed Nasrallah – no relation to Hassan Nasrallah – who allegedly contacted Hariri's security detail and told them that he had solid proof that Hezbollah was planning to take his life. Hariri then contacted Hezbollah and advised them of the situation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/nasrallah-israel-used-secret-agent-to-turn-lebanon-gov-t-against-hezbollah-1.307008|title=Nasrallah: Israel used secret agent to turn Lebanon gov't against Hezbollah|date=August 9, 2010|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref> Saad Hariri responded that the UN should investigate these claims.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/lebanon-pm-un-must-probe-claims-of-israeli-complicity-in-hariri-murder-1.307587?localLinksEnabled=false|title=Lebanon PM: UN must probe claims of Israeli complicity in Hariri murder|date=August 12, 2010|work=Haaretz.com}}</ref>

===Designation as a terrorist organization or resistance movement===
<!--Linked from [[Hassan Nasrallah]]-->
Hezbollah's status as a legitimate political party, a terrorist group, a resistance movement, or some combination thereof is a contentious issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/blog/2013/09/25/hezbollahs-military-and-politics-any-difference|title="Hezbollah's Military and Political: Any Difference?" By Richard Horowitz, World Policy Institute, September 25, 2013|publisher=}}</ref>

There is a "wide difference" between American and Arab perception of Hezbollah.<ref name=nybooks /> Several [[Western world|Western countries]] officially classify Hezbollah or its external security wing as a [[terrorist organization]], and some of their violent acts have been described as terrorist attacks. However, throughout most of the [[Arab world|Arab]] and [[Muslim world]]s, Hezbollah is referred to as a [[resistance movement]], engaged in [[National security|national defense]].<ref name="HG20Ak02"/><ref name="hiof-Views">{{cite web|url=http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/hizballah/hizballah-background.html |title=Hizbullah: Views and Concepts|publisher=Almashriq|date=June 20, 1997|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/300/320/324/324.2/hizballah/statement01.html |title=Statement of purpose |publisher=Almashriq|date=March 20, 1998 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> Even within Lebanon, sometimes Hezbollah's status as either a "militia" or "national resistance" has been contentious. In Lebanon, although not universally well-liked, Hezbollah is widely seen as a legitimate national resistance organization defending Lebanon, and actually described by Lebanese information minister as an important ally in fighting terrorist groups.<ref name=nybooks /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Dionigi|first1=Filippo|title=Hezbollah, Islamist Politics, and International Society|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137403025|pages=153–156}}</ref> In Arab world, Hezbollah is generally seen either as a destabilizing force that functions as Iran's pawn by rentier states like [[Egypt]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], or as a popular sociopolitical [[guerilla]] movement that exemplifies strong leadership, meaningful political action, and a commitment to [[social justice]].

In May 2013, [[France]] and [[Germany]] released statements that it will join other European countries in calling for a [[European Union|EU]]-blacklisting of Hezbollah as a terror group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/paris-backs-blacklisting-hezbollah-over-assad-ties/|title=Blacklisting Hezbollah EU is Blacklisting Hezbollah|work=The Times of Israel}}</ref>

====In the Western world====
The United States Department of State has designated Hezbollah a terrorist organization since 1995. The group remains on Foreign Terrorist Organization and
Specially Designated Terrorist lists. According to the [[Congressional Research Service]], "The U.S. government holds Hezbollah responsible for a number of attacks and hostage takings targeting Americans in Lebanon during the 1980s, including the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in April 1983 and the bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in October 1983, which together killed 258 Americans. Hezbollah’s operations outside of Lebanon, including its participation in bombings of Israeli and Jewish targets in Argentina during the 1990s and more recent training and liaison activities with Shiite insurgents in Iraq, have cemented the organization’s reputation among U.S. policy makers as a capable and deadly adversary with potential global reach."<ref>Casey L.

Tuení believed that Hezbollah's evolution is cosmetic, concealing a sinister long-term strategy to Islamicize Lebanon and lead it into a ruinous war with Israel.<ref name=nybooks/>

While Hezbollah has supported popular uprisings in [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], [[2011 Yemeni uprising|Yemen]], Bahrain and [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisia]], Hezbollah publicly sided with Iran and Syria in their own [[2011 Syrian uprising|violent repressions of dissent]]. In August 2010, 800 people demonstrated in Beirut against Syrian President Bashar Assad, and police were called in to contain the smaller pro-Syrian rallies that followed. Demonstrators were shouting, "Syria wants freedom," "Anyone who kills his people is a murderer and a coward," and "the people want an end to the regime."<ref>{{cite news|last=Spangler|first=Timothy |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=233279 |title=Syria uprising stirs old divisions in neighboring Lebanon |newspaper=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=November 22, 2011}}</ref>

===Views of foreign legislators===
[[J. Gresham Barrett]] brought up legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives which, among other things, referred to Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. Congress members [[Tom Lantos]], [[Jim Saxton]], [[Thad McCotter]], [[Chris Shays]], [[Charles Boustany]], [[Alcee Hastings]], and [[Robert Wexler]] referred to Hezbollah as a terrorist organization in their speeches supporting the legislation.<ref>Congress. [https://books.google.com/?id=eaCIX6d3Y5YC&pg=PA4533 ''Congressional Record'', V. 151, Pt. 4 ...."] Government Printing Office. March 11 to April 6, 2005. January 23, 2011.</ref> Shortly before a speech by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, U.S. Congressman [[Dennis Hastert]] said, "He [Maliki] denounces terrorism, and I have to take him at his word. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization."<ref>{{cite news|author=Weisman, Jonathan|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/26/AR2006072600230.html|title=Iraqi Prime Minister Presses for More Aid|newspaper=Washington Post|date=July 27, 2006|accessdate=September 4, 2013}}</ref>

In 2011, a bipartisan group of members of Congress introduced the Hezbollah Anti-Terrorism Act.  The act ensures that no American aid to Lebanon will enter the hands of Hezbollah. On the day of the act's introduction, Congressman [[Darrell Issa]] said, "Hezbollah is a terrorist group and a cancer on Lebanon. The Hezbollah Anti-Terrorism Act surgically targets this cancer and will strengthen the position of Lebanese who oppose Hezbollah."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/ca28_berman/HATA_Joint_Release.shtml |title=Reps.

In a [[Sky News]] interview during the 2006 Lebanon war, British MP [[George Galloway]] said that Hezbollah is: "not a terrorist organization".<ref>{{cite video|people=George Galloway, Anna Botting|title=Getting a word in|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbyF1Mp-fHk|format=TV|medium=News|publisher=Sky News|accessdate=January 22, 2011|time=3:59–4:04|quote=But they're not a terrorist organization.}}</ref>

Former Swiss member of parliament, [[Jean Ziegler]], said in 2006: "I refuse to describe Hezbollah as a terrorist group. It is a national movement of resistance."<ref>{{cite news|title=Switzerland nominates Hezbollah advocate for UN Human Rights Council |author=Benjamin Weinthal|newspaper=Jerusalem Post|date=August 14, 2013|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Switzerland-nominates-Hezbollah-advocate-for-UN-Human-Rights-Council-322971|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}</ref>
