'''Amiens''' ({{IPA-fr|a.mjɛ̃}}) is a city and [[Communes of France|commune]] in northern France, {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Paris and {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} south-west of [[Lille]]. It is the capital of the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] [[Departments of France|department]] in [[Picardy (region)|Picardy]]. The city had a population of 136,105 according to the 2006 census.

The first known settlement is '''Samarobriva''' ("Somme bridge"), the central settlement of the [[Ambiani]], one of the [[List of peoples of Gaul|principal tribes of Gaul]]. The town was given the name Ambianum by the Romans, meaning settlement of the Ambiani people. The town has been much fought over, being attacked by [[barbarian]] tribes, and later by the [[Normans]]. In 1113 the city was recognized by King [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] of [[Kingdom of France|France]], and joined to the Crown of France in 1185. In 1597, Spanish soldiers held the city during the six-month [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|Siege of Amiens]], before [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] regained control. During the 18th and 19th century, the textile tradition of Amiens became famous for its [[velours]]. In 1789 the provinces of France were dismantled and the territory was organised into [[Departments of France|departments]]. Much of [[Picardy]] became the newly created department of [[Somme (department)|Somme]], with Amiens as the departmental capital. During the [[industrial revolution]] the city walls were demolished, opening up space for large boulevards around the town centre. The [[Henriville, Amiens|Henriville]] neighbourhood in the south of the city was developed around this time. In 1848, the first railway arrived in Amiens, linking the city to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. During the 1870 [[Battle of Amiens (1870)|Battle of Amiens]], when the Somme was invaded by Prussian forces, Amiens was occupied.

The town was fought over during both the First and Second World Wars, suffering much damage, and being occupied several times by both sides. The 1918 [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]], was the opening phase of the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], which led directly to the [[Armistice with Germany]] that ended the war. It was heavily bombed by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. The city was rebuilt according to [[Pierre Dufau]]'s plans, with a focus on widening the streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The architect [[Auguste Perret]] designed the [[Gare d'Amiens]] train station and nearby [[Tour Perret (Amiens)|Tour Perret]].

It has one of the biggest university hospitals in France with a capacity of 1200 beds.

[[Amiens Cathedral]], the tallest of the large, classic, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] churches of the 13th century and the largest in France of its kind, is a [[World Heritage Site]]. The author [[Jules Verne]] lived in Amiens from 1871 until his death in 1905, and served on the city council for 15 years. During December, the town hosts the largest [[Christmas market]] in northern France. Amiens is known for a few local foods, including "[[macarons d'Amiens]]", almond paste biscuits; "tuiles amienoises", chocolate and orange curved biscuits; "pâté de canard d'Amiens", duck pate in pastry; "la ficelle Picarde", an oven-baked cheese-topped [[crêpe]]; and "[[flamiche aux poireaux]]", a puff pastry tart made with leeks and cream.

==Geography==

===Location===
[[File:Map commune FR insee code 80021.png|thumb|right|Map of the Amiens and its surrounding communes]]
Amiens, the regional prefecture of [[Picardy]], is also the prefecture of the [[Somme (department)|Somme]], one of the three departments (with [[Oise]] and [[Aisne]]) in the region. Located in the [[Paris Basin (geology)|Paris Basin]], across the country the city benefits from a privileged geographical position (proximity to [[Paris]], [[Lille]], [[Rouen]], [[London]] and [[Brussels]]). At the crossroads of major European routes of movement ([[A1 autoroute (France)|A1]], [[A16 autoroute|A16]] and [[A29 autoroute|A29]]), the city is also at the heart of a major rail star.

[[As the crow flies]], the city is {{convert|115|km|mi}} from Paris, {{convert|97|km|mi}} from Lille, {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Rouen, {{convert|162|km|mi}} from [[Le Havre]] and {{convert|144|km|mi}} from [[Reims]]. At the regional level, Amiens is located {{convert|53|km|mi}} north of [[Beauvais]], {{convert|71|km|mi}} west of [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]], {{convert|66|km|mi}} from [[Compiègne]] and {{convert|102|km|mi}} from [[Laon]].

In area, it is the third in the Somme, after [[Crécy-en-Ponthieu]] and [[Hornoy-le-Bourg]].

===Geology and relief===
The area of the commune is {{convert|4946|ha|acre}}; the altitude varies between {{convert|14 and 106|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professionnels.ign.fr/rgc#tab-3|title=Répertoire géographique des communes 2012|publisher=[[Institut géographique national]]|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>

===Hydrography: Somme and canal, Avre and Selle===
[[File:LL 69 - AMIENS - Vue prise dans la vieille ville.JPG|thumb|left|150px|The Somme in the old town at the beginning of the 20th century]]
[[File:INCONNU - Vieil Amiens - Pont Becquet.JPG|thumb|right|The Becquet Bridge, at the start of the 20th century]]

Amiens is crossed by the [[main stem]] of the [[River Somme]] and is generally quiet, except during exceptional floods,  several weeks long (such as spring 2001). It is also, on its southeastern outskirts, close to [[Camon, Somme|Camon]] and [[Longueau]], the [[confluence]] with its main [[tributary]] on the left bank (to the south), the [[Avre (Somme)|Avre]]. The [[Selle]] enters from the northwest of Amiens, with two arms (including the Haute Selle) passing behind the Unicorn Stadium, the exhibition park, the megacity and horse racing track, then passing the end of the ''Promenade de la Hotoie'' and the zoo of Amiens, and to the right of the water treatment plant, in front of the island Sainte-Aragone, opposite the cemetery of La Madeleine in Amiens.

The city developed in a natural narrowing of the river at the level of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Hortillonnages d'Amiens|Hortillonnages d'Amiens|hortillonnages}}, due to the advance of the rim of the Picard plateau in Saint-Pierre ([[Ford (crossing)|ford crossing]]). The Amiens citadel is built on this limestone butte and ''Rue Saint-Pierre'' is a path slightly inclined path to leave the city from the north. At this narrowing, a network of narrow canals led to the construction of bridges and buildings including [[Textile manufacturing|textile mills]] in the [[Middle Ages]].

The hydrographic network has always been an important asset operated by the city. The river helped shape the identity of the landscape, urban and economic territory. It is around the quarters of Saint-Leu, Saint-Maurice bordering the River Somme and most of the administrative and civil area of the current city centre which the city has developed since [[Ancient history|antiquity]].

The [[Canal de la Somme]] dates from the beginning of the 19th century and the bridge at the foot of the citadel was built after [[World War II]].

===Climate===
Amiens has a typical [[oceanic climate]] in the north of France, with relatively mild winters, cool summers, and rainfall well distributed throughout the year.

[[File:Ombrothermic diagram of Amiens.png|800px|centre]]

===Transport===
Amiens is a [[Transport hub|hub]] between the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île de France]] and the rest of the north of France; [[Normandy]] and [[Benelux]]; and France and Great Britain. Amiens is not directly on principal European road and rail arteries, such as the [[A1 autoroute (France)|A1 motorway]] and the Paris-Lille [[TGV]] train line, at present.

However, at halfway between the urban areas of Lille and Paris, Amiens has good conditions of service and accessibility, including motorways (at the junction of the [[A16 autoroute|A16]] and [[A29 autoroute|A29]]).

A regular bus link with the [[Gare TGV Haute-Picardie|TGV Haute-Picardie station]] also provides access to the [[Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV|Charles-de-Gaulle Airport station]]. On the horizon of 2022,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/picardie/2015/02/20/sncf-le-tgv-arrivera-t-il-un-jour-amiens-659253.html|title=SNCF : quels sont les chantiers prévus en Picardie en 2015 ?|first1=Nathalie|last1=Tissot|date=20 February 2015|publisher=[[France 3 Picardie]]}}</ref> the [[Roissy–Picardie Link]] will put Amiens 55 minutes from Paris Charles-de-Gaulle Airport and its TGV station.

By train, Amiens is located at:

====Roads====
{{see also|{{Interlanguage link|fr|Rocade d'Amiens}}}}

Since antiquity, Amiens has been a crossroads of important routes. The contemporary city is served by the [[A16 autoroute|A16]] and [[A29 autoroute|A29]] autoroutes. The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Viaduc Jules-Verne|Viaduc Jules-Verne|Jules Verne Viaduct}}, {{convert|943|m|ft}} long, crosses the [[River Somme]] to the east of the city and allows circumvention of the city by motorway-type roads. The A16 and A29 autoroutes, the RN1 and the RN25 form a bypass-type motorway around the city that the population has called the ''Rocade d'Amiens'' [ring road of Amiens]. Initially constituting national roads which are downgraded today, mostly as departmental roads, the greater urban area of Amiens is served by:

<center>
{|  style="vertical-align:top; width:100%;"
|-
|  style="vertical-align:top; width:50%;"|
*[[Route nationale 1|RN 1]] to [[Beauvais]] and [[Paris]], to the South, and towards [[Abbeville]], [[Calais]], [[Dunkirk]] and the Belgian border, northwest.
*[[Route nationale 25|RN 25]] towards [[Doullens]], [[Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise]] and [[Arras]]
*[[Route nationale 29|RD 1029]] towards [[Yvetot]] and [[Neufchâtel-en-Bray]] to the west, [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] and [[La Capelle]] in the east.

*{{Interlanguage link|fr|Route nationale 334|Route nationale 334|RD 934}} to [[Roye, Somme|Roye]] and [[Noyon]].
|}
</center>

Amiens is served by several motorways:

*[[A16 autoroute|A16]] to [[Calais]] via [[Abbeville]] and [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]
*A16 to Paris via [[Beauvais]]
*[[A29 autoroute|A29]] to [[Rouen]] and [[Le Havre]] via [[Neufchâtel-en-Bray]]
*A29 to [[Reims]] via [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]] and [[Laon]]
*The proposed A24 autoroute from Amiens to [[Lille]] via [[Doullens]] was cancelled in 2006.

====Parking====

According to the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Plan de déplacements urbains|Plan de déplacements urbains|urban transport plan}} (PDU) approved 19 December 2013 for the period 2013-2023 parking supply is considered abundant in Amiens.<ref name="PDU">{{cite web|url=http://fr.calameo.com/read/00120283528d25dba53b8|title=PDU - Plan de déplacements urbains - Amiens Métropole - 2013-2023 |date=19 December 2013|publisher=amiens.fr}}</ref> Although important, demand for parking is less than what is available (capacity reserves are still 20% minimum: If the road is sometimes saturated, the occupancy rate of the underground parking remains globally less than 100%).<ref name="PDU" />

In 2013, the city counted approximately 70,000 public parking spaces, including 8,400 in the city centre and in its immediate vicinity, where 70% of places are paid.<ref name="PDU" />

*4,400 spaces on highways (1,950 in the inner city, including 1,600 paid)
*4,000 spaces in underground parking (620 other new places are programmed in a project for the Gare La Vallée development zone).

The underground car parks in the city centre are organised thus:

{{As of|2007}}, a residential parking system is deployed in Saint-Anne ward to cope with congestion in the streets by cars of users from the [[Gare d'Amiens|SNCF railway station]]. During the campaign for the [[French municipal elections, 2008|municipal election of 2008]], parking was one of the important topics of debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/informations/le-difficile-pari-de-demailly_725298.html|title=Le difficile pari de Demailly|first1=Jacques|last1=Trentesaux|work=L'Express|date=16 October 2008}}</ref> A year after the change of majority, the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Gilles Demailly}} team launched a consultation with the population.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Delphine|last1=Richard|title=Le stationnement en huit questions|work=Le Courrier picard|date=9 March 2009|url=http://courrier-picard.fr/courrier/Actualites/Info-locale/Amiens-et-Metropole/Le-stationnement-en-huit-questions}}</ref> From 2011, the residential parking was extended to the quarters of Gare-La-Vallée and Riolan, then in 2012 the Noyon and the area east of the Riolan sector. In 2014, 2,600 parking spaces<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens.fr/actualite/3232/stationnement-residentiel.html|title=Stationnement résidentiel|date=21 August 2014|publisher=amiens.fr}}</ref> were affected by this system which is designed to allow city residents more parking near their homes, to promote a better rotation of vehicles in the streets and reduce permanent occupation of public space by the cars cluttering the highway.

====Public transport====
{{main|{{Interlanguage link|fr|Former tramway of Amiens|Ancien tramway d'Amiens}}|{{Interlanguage link|fr|Tramway of Amiens|Tramway d'Amiens}}|{{Interlanguage link|fr|Public transport in Amiens|Transports en commun d'Amiens}}}}

Two [[tram]] lines over {{convert|10.7|km|mi}} were opened in 1887. The two intersect at ''Place Gambetta'', one linking {{Interlanguage link|fr|Cimetière de La Madeleine (Amiens)|Cimetière de La Madeleine (Amiens)|La Madeleine Cemetery}}, the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Abbaye de Saint-Acheul|Abbaye de Saint-Acheul|Church of Saint-Acheul}}, Cagnard bridge, ''Rue de Noyon'' and ''Rue Jules-Barni''; the other from the Church of Saint-Pierre at the racecourse, by the streets of Saint-Leu, Frédéric-Petit and Colbert.

Electrified in 1899, the network grew to seven lines totalling {{convert|19|km|mi}} in 1906. From 1932, [[Longueau]] was linked to Amiens by a bus service. The terrible German bombing in 1940 which destroyed most of the city centre also hit the Jules-Ferry Road tram {{Interlanguage link|fr|Former tramway of Amiens|Ancien tramway d'Amiens|depot}} and totally destroyed the tram fleet. Only the Longueau bus survived. Amiens remained without transport. A few old Parisian buses were then used for an extremely reduced service. These buses as well as the survivor bus were then converted to city gas and equipped with tanks on the roof covered by a huge white dome. This service continued with this extraordinary material until approximately 1946. There were only two urban lines: An east-west line (Saint-Acheul - Montieres) and a northeast-southwest line (Beauville - road to Rouen). It was decided after war to serve the city by [[trolleybus]] with one bus route to Longueau. This programme was only in part realised (serving Saint-Acheul), road to Rouen, La Madeleine and Saint-Pierre. In 1964, trolleybuses were abandoned and the bus became ubiquitous in Amiens transportation.<ref>Jean-Marie Fouré, ''Amiens, du tram au bus'', édition du Moulin-Alidor.</ref>

The bus network is today managed by the Ametis {{Interlanguage link|fr|Société d'économie mixte|Société d'économie mixte|mixed economy company}}, whose network covers {{Interlanguage link|fr|Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole|Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole|Amiens Métropole}}, the agglomeration of Amiens. The establishment of dedicated [[bus lane]]s began in 2006. Former Mayor [[Gilles de Robien]] had envisioned the creation of a [[tram]], but the choice of dedicated [[bus lane]]s had been preferred for reasons of cost and attendance. His successor, Mayor {{Interlanguage link|fr|Gilles Demailly}}, had been considering the development of a {{h:title|Transport en commun en site propre (public transport in a dedicated site)|TSCP}} in the metropolitan area. As a result of numerous studies and conferences, elected representatives voted for the creation of a tram at the municipal Council of 15 November 2012. The project had been endorsed by the [[Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole]] on 18 December 2012 and the commissioning of a first north-south {{Interlanguage link|fr|Tramway of Amiens|Tramway d'Amiens|tram route}} was scheduled for 2018/2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amiens.fr/nos_projets/tcsp.html|title=Le TCSP, atout majeur de qualité de vie et d’attractivité pour Amiens Métropole.|work=amiens.fr|accessdate=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729040327/http://amiens.fr/nos_projets/tcsp.html|archivedate=29 July 2012}}</ref> Following the {{Interlanguage link|fr|2014 municipal election in Amiens|Élection municipale de 2014 à Amiens|elections of 2014}}, which were a defeat for most municipal and community carriers of the project, the new mayor of Amiens [[Brigitte Fouré]] and by extension the new president of Amiens Métropole [[Alain Gest]] decided to suspend the project at least during the time of their respective mandates, thus applying a campaign promise (the tram was at the heart of debate)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courrier-picard.fr/region/le-tramway-amienois-toujours-au-coeur-des-debats-ia167b0n347017|title=ALe tramway amiénois toujours au cœur des débats|work=Le Courrier picard|date=8 April 2014}}</ref> and despite a project announcement of [[Guided bus|trams on tyres]] (of [[Bombardier Guided Light Transit|TVR]] type).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://picardie.france3.fr/2014/04/11/amiens-80-aucune-forme-de-tram-pendant-mon-mandat-selon-brigitte-foure-457241.html|title=Amiens (80): "Aucune forme de tram pendant mon mandat" selon Brigitte Fouré|work=picardie.france3.fr|date=11 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courrier-picard.fr/region/amiens-pas-de-tramway-durant-le-mandat-de-brigitte-foure-ia201b0n348563|title=AMIENS Pas de tramway durant le mandat de Brigitte Fouré selon un tweet|work=courrier-picard.fr|date=11 April 2014}}</ref> Improvement of public transit would then be only by that of the bus network.

====Cycle networks====
[[File:Vélam Amiens.jpg|thumb|Vélam public [[bicycle sharing system]] in Amiens.]]

{{main|{{Interlanguage link|fr|Vélam}}}}
Amiens has developed two bike services: ''Buscyclette'' and {{Interlanguage link|fr|Vélam|Vélam|''Velam''}}.

*''Buscyclette'' is a service of rental bikes on demand, created in May 1999. In 2014, nearly 2,400 "green bikes" are available for rent, essentially city bikes but also [[electric bicycle|electric bikes]] (VAE), [[folding bicycle]]s and specific bikes (kids bikes, child trailers, [[mountain bike]]s, [[freight bicycle|freight bike]]s, [[tandem bicycle|tandem]]s, etc.). The rental period varies from half a day to one year.
*{{Interlanguage link|fr|Vélam|Vélam|''Velam''}} is a [[bicycle sharing system|bike sharing system]] (VLS) created on 16 February 2008, an adaptation of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Cyclocity}} system managed by [[JCDecaux]], similar to [[Vélo'v]] in Lyon and [[Vélib']] in Paris. {{Interlanguage link|fr|Vélam}} offers 313 bikes distributed every 300 to 400 metres in the centre of Amiens and 26 stations.

In 2012, [[Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole|Amiens Métropole]] had {{convert|100|km|mi}} of routes for cyclists.<ref name="PDU" /> Despite the development of a bicycle plan in 1997 which was planning the development of {{convert|500|km|mi}} of equipped cycleways, the network of the territory in terms of paths is still incomplete.

The blueprint of the bicycle facilities of the agglomeration (SDAC) provides, over a period of 10 years (2014-2024),<ref name="PDU" /> for {{convert|188|km|mi}} of cycle routes and equips 490 sites for the parking of bikes. This plan also includes the deployment of parking facilities over the entire territory of the city, close to the facilities frequented by bikers, as well as {{Interlanguage link|fr|Tourne-à-droite cycliste|Tourne-à-droite cycliste|cyclist right-turns}} at traffic lights or even the maintenance of existing facilities.

====Railways====
[[File:Verrère place Alphonse Fiquet, Gare d'Amiens.jpg|thumb|right|Gare du Nord and its canopy in August 2012]]

There are three railway stations:

*Two stations on the [[Longueau–Boulogne railway|Paris-Boulogne]] and [[Amiens–Rouen railway|Amiens - Rouen]] lines:
;*The [[Gare d'Amiens|Amiens station]], main station, known as ''Gare du Nord'', in memory of the [[French Northern Railway|Compagnie du Nord]] who created it. Every day, 15,000 travellers use its seven lines.<ref name="bedel">Benoit Delespierre, ''Longueau, l'autre gare d'Amiens'', ''[[Le Courrier picard|Courrier picard]]'', 11 avril 2013.</ref>

;*The [[Gare de Saint-Roch (Somme)|station of Saint-Roch]]

Connections from these two stations include to [[Gare de Lille-Flandres|Lille]] via [[Arras, France|Arras]] and [[Douai]], to [[Boulogne]] via [[Abbeville]], to Paris-Nord via [[Creil]] or [[Compiègne]], to [[Reims]] via [[Tergnier]], and to [[Rouen]].

*A station located on the [[Paris–Lille railway|Paris - Lille line]] in [[Longueau]] serving south of Amiens and the communes of Longueau, [[Cagny, Somme|Cagny]], [[Boves, Somme|Boves]], etc.

*{{Interlanguage link|fr|Gare de Montières|Montieres station}}, station assigned to the freight traffic, it serves only the industrial zone of Amiens. This station is located on the former railway line of [[Doullens]].

Many regional and extra regional links (Haute-Normandie, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, Champagne-Ardenne and île-de-France) pass through Amiens, especially by [[TER Picardie]].

A station located {{convert|45|km|mi}} from Amiens, the [[Gare TGV Haute-Picardie|Haute-Picardie TGV station]], allows access to the [[TGV]] network. It is served by buses from Amiens. Its isolated character earned it the name of ''gare des betteraves'', or ''gare betteraves'', at the time of its construction.<ref>This expression, which dates from before 2004, is due to a Socialist politician from the [[Haute-Vienne]], {{Interlanguage link|fr|Jacques Santrot}}, the expression which was then adopted by a geographer, Jean-François Troin, which also cited the TGV stations of [[Vendôme]], [[Mâcon]], and [[Le Creusot]]. {{cite web|url=http://www.lorraine.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/Rapport_Adielor_Phase_2_cle817d73.pdf|title=Analyse de l’impact du TGV-Est sur les agglomérations de Metz, Nancy, Épinal et Thionville|page=33|id=rapport de phase 2, I.S.I.S.

====Waterways====
The Somme [[canal]] runs through the town to the [[English Channel]]. This canal is linked to the [[Canal du Nord]] (Paris to Lille metropolitan area)

==Urbanism==

===Urban morphology===

Amiens comprises a number of neighbourhoods ("quartiers" in French) with their own characteristics, including [[Saint-Leu, Amiens|Saint-Leu]], [[St-Maurice, Amiens|St-Maurice]], Henriville, and [[Saint-Acheul]].

====Saint-Leu quarter====
St-Leu is a part of Amiens north of the city centre. It has many older wooden and brick houses and several canals. At the foot of the cathedral, traversed by canals, this picturesque area was largely rehabilitated during the 1990s. It extends to the [[River Somme|Somme]] canal, located more to the north, at the foot of the Coteau Saint-Pierre on which the fortress of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Jean Errard}}, called ''Citadelle'', was built. Historically, it was the poor quarter of the city, where butchers, tanners and dyers gathered.

Amiens University's Faculty of Sciences, present since the 1960s, has been renovated and expanded on occasion. The Faculty of Law and Economics has also been transferred since the mid-1990s from the campus (offset to the south of the city) to its new location at the foot of the cathedral.<ref group="note">Work had also been delayed, because some people wanted to "preserve the cathedral", the situation was exceptional.</ref> The open-air parking it replaces was a "gap" in the landscape dating from [[World War II]]. Nonetheless, it allowed an unobstructed view of the cathedral. Most of the buildings have been renovated and transformed into housing much of which is for students, many of whom are in the quarter.

The area became the heart of the Amiens people's evenings, with many establishments (bars, restaurants, etc.) on ''Place du Don'' and ''Quai Bélu''.

At ''Rue Saint-Leu'' is found the church, located just between the Faculty of Science and Law-Economy (UPJV).

Two theatres were established in the quarter, that of the [[Chés Cabotans]] (puppet shows in the [[Picard language]]) and the ''Maison du Théâtre'' at the foot of the Saint-Leu Church. There is also ''La Lune des Pirates'', a concert hall.

====Saint-Maurice quarter====
Located to the west of the [[Citadel]]le, and east of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Cimetière de La Madeleine (Amiens)|Cimetière de La Madeleine (Amiens)|La Madeleine Cemetery}}, this very old working-class quarter of Amiens, and industrial centre of the 18th century, is undergoing rehabilitation with the construction, rearrangement and renovation of much housing.

Bordered by the [[Canal de la Somme]], it offers a stopover for leisure boats, which must go through a lock.

The walls of the city's former [[dye]] factory are now those of the {{Ill|fr|École supérieure d'art et de design d'Amiens}} (ESAD) as well as those of the Faculty of Arts. The [[ESIEE Amiens|École supérieure d'ingénieurs en électronique et électrotechnique]] (ESIEE) is in the same quarter. As the Citadelle, it will be renovated by the architect [[Renzo Piano]] to accommodate the university departments (UFR) of letters, of history and geography, of languages, the {{Interlanguage link|fr|École supérieure du professorat et de l'éducation}} (ESPE), the House of Languages, the House of Research and the University Library in 2015.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Jardin des plantes d'Amiens|Jardin des plantes d'Amiens|Jardin des plantes}}, known as the ''Jardin du Roy'' within the city, is also located in this quarter.

[[File:Ami1b.JPG|thumb|The [[River Somme]] from the Boulevard de Beauvillé]]

====Henriville quarter====
The Henriville neighbourhood was mostly built during the 19th century after the demolition of the city wall. It lies at the south of the town centre. It has numerous [[bourgeois]] houses and [[townhouse]]s, predominantly in brick, blending architectural styles of the period, including [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], [[Troubadour style#Architecture|troubadour]] and [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic]]. There are also private mansions, such as the Acloque mansion and the house of [[Jules Verne]].

====Saint-Acheul quarter====
The Saint-Acheul quarter ({{IPA-fr|aʃoel|IPA}}) existed before Amiens, as people have lived there since prehistoric times. This is where archaeological excavations in the nineteenth century discovered prehistoric tool sets typical of the "[[Acheulean]]" prehistorical era, named after this neighbourhood (also spelled Acheulian, pronounced {{IPA-fr|əˈʃuːliən|}}). An archaeological garden can be freely visited there.

Not to be confused with the [[commune]] of [[Saint-Acheul]] situated {{convert|37|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north, the quarter of Saint-Acheul is the site of a military cemetery from the [[First World War]] (1914–1918).

It also contains the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Abbaye de Saint-Acheul|Abbaye de Saint-Acheul|Church of Saint-Acheul}}, and the former [[normal school]] of teachers which became the Lycée Robert-de-Luzarches. A number of famous people are buried in the former Saint-Acheul cemetery such as J.-P. Pinchon (creator of ''[[Bécassine]]'') and many resistance fighters. Part of the quarter includes a so-called "English neighbourhood," with typical English style houses. At the feet of this area lie the {{Ill|fr|hortillonnages|Hortillonnages d'Amiens}}, a marshy area criss-crossed by canals.

====Other neighbourhoods====
Amiens, like other big cities, has its large [[HLM]] high-rise tower blocks:

*North of the city the quarters ''du [[Pigeonnier]]'', which is famous for its weekend market, ''Messenger'', ''Mozart'', ''Fafet-Brossolette-la Cité'', ''Balzac'', ''Léo Lagrange-Schweitzer'', etc.;
*Southeast of the city: ''[[Victorine-Autier]]'', ''Philéas Lebesgue'', ''Condorcet'', ''Pierre-Rollin''.
*West: ''[[Etouvie]]'' and ''Montieres'' (an [[ecodistrict]] is provided in this industrial space, where there are buildings of the 19th century, in brick).<ref>{{cite journal|title=Amiens, Un écoquartier en projet à Montières|id=E.G|journal=Le Moniteur|issue=5510|date=3 July 2009}}</ref>
*East: ''Saint-Acheul-la-Cité'' and the ''Clos de l'Avre''.

These areas experience a lot of social troubles and have regularly been the place for riots. The northern quarters were the scene of violent events in 1994, 1999 and 2000 (clashes between several districts of the city and between the neighbourhoods of Amiens and the districts of [[Creil]]), in 2006 and 2008 (in the wake of incidents in the Paris suburbs){{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and more recently in August 2012 following a conflict between youth and the police. The cost of the latest vandalism to occur in the north of Amiens would amount, according to {{Interlanguage link|fr|Gilles Demailly}}, to between four and six million euros. These extremely violent riots caused sixteen police officers to be injured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valeursactuelles.com/actualit%C3%A9s/politique/guerre-d%E2%80%99amiens-bien-eu-lieu20120918.html|title=La guerre d’Amiens a bien eu lieu|first=Gilles|last=Gaetner|work=Valeurs actuelles|date=20 September 2012}}</ref>

An extensive programme of redevelopment of these neighborhoods began recently, demolished HLM tower blocks and new infrastructure have been built, especially for schools. In 2009, the public transport network of the Amiens agglomeration was significantly modified.

===Housing===
In 2009, the total number of dwellings in the municipality was 68,145, while it was 63,201 in 1999.<ref group="Insee">''LOG T1M - Évolution du nombre de logements par catégorie''</ref>

Among this housing, 91.7% were primary residences, 1.0% of secondary residences and 7.4% vacant housing. These dwellings were 38.7% of detached houses and 60.2% of apartments.<ref group="Insee" name="LOG T2">''LOG T2 - Catégories et types de logements''</ref>

The proportion of principal residences, which were the properties of occupants, was 34.0%, down from 1999 (35.3%). The share of empty rented [[HLM]] homes (social housing) was also down: 29.0% against 32.5% in 1999, their number decreased from 18,692 to 18,103. However, this percentage remains much greater than the rate of 20% required by the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Loi relative à la solidarité et au renouvellement urbains|Loi relative à la solidarité et au renouvellement urbains|law on solidarity and urban renewal}} (SRU) for cities and agglomerations of more than 50,000 inhabitants.<ref group="Insee">''LOG T7 - Résidences principales selon le statut d'occupation''</ref>

The identity of the city is strongly marked by the specificity of its housing stock consisting in a large proportion of detached houses, semi-detached, single or bourgeois: the ''amiénoises''. These traditional houses in the suburbs, in brick and floor(s), were intrinsically linked to the expansion of the city during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The ''amiénoise simple'' includes a window on the ground floor and floors for attic and basement. It is built on a plot of a few metres wide but is very deep, and includes a garden, forming hearts with green islets and sparse areas. The ''amiénoise double'' has two windows at each level. The ''grandes amiénoises'' and townhouses rise to at least two floors with large rooms. They can have a gate opening onto a paved courtyard.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://crdp.ac-amiens.fr/idp/page3/files/9233b8e97237acc21a3da03f14b66d0c-259.html|title= L’Amiénoise|first1=Alain|last1=Boulnois|date= 2008|publisher= le site du centre régional de documentation pédagogique de l’académie d’Amiens
}}</ref>

The official buildings or mansions regularly use [[brick]] façades on a sandstone base, decorated by stone window and door frames.

The Chanoines quarter has stone façades exclusively.

In historic areas such as the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Saint-Leu (Amiens)|Saint-Leu (Amiens)|Saint-Leu}} quarter, façades widely use wood, [[half-timbered]] or [[siding]], and [[wattle and daub]].

===Development projects===
*Amiens 2030: Amiens, in the context of the [[Communauté d'agglomération Amiens Métropole]], is developing a master plan of development called Amiens 2030.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens.fr/actions-projets/meilleures-conditions-vie/projet-metropolitain/projet-metropolitain.html|title=Le projet métropolitain Amiens 2030|work=amiens.fr}}</ref> This strategic outreach project shapes around priority issues of economic, social and cultural development of the agglomeration. The whole process of reflection will determine the development of the metropolis by the 2030.
*{{Interlanguage link|fr|Citadelle d'Amiens|Citadelle d'Amiens|La Citadelle}}: This flagship project for the agglomeration involves the amalgamation of units of training and research from the [[University of Picardie Jules Verne|University of Picardie]] in letters, languages, history, geography, philosophy, sociology, psychology and the {{Interlanguage link|fr|École supérieure du professorat et de l'éducation|École supérieure du professorat et de l'éducation|College teaching and education}} (ESPE) on the site of La Citadelle; set of {{convert|18|acre|ha}} on the outskirts of downtown. This university construction programme should strengthen regional competitiveness and the development of higher education and research. The project, entrusted to the Italian architect [[Renzo Piano]], provides an opening of the campus on the city and will be accessible to all its inhabitants.
*ZAC Gare-la-Vallée: The project must strengthen Amiens in his role as regional capital and allow the creation of a genuine business district in the heart of the city. With a budget of €157 million, the project combines tertiary activities, shops and habitat walk from the [[Gare d'Amiens|station]] and the inner city. The first buildings were inaugurated in 2008. A second phase of development extends from 2012 to 2017. Under the control of the Chief Architect, [[Paul Chemetov]], the quarter must especially accommodate 2,000 homes, {{convert|200000|m2|sqft}} of offices and two urban parks creating a visible link between downtown, the [[River Somme|Somme]] and the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Hortillonnages d'Amiens|Hortillonnages d'Amiens|Hortillonnages}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens-garelavallee.fr/|title=Amiens Gare La Vallée|work=projet Gare-la-Vallée|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616222450/http://www.amiens-garelavallee.fr/|archivedate=16 June 2012}}</ref>

It will include {{convert|12|ha|acre}} of gardens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens-amenagement.fr/Projets/Intercampus/Le-projet-urbain|title=ZAC Intercampus sur le site d'Amiens Aménagement}}</ref>
*ZAC Paul Claudel: This new housing and services quarter of {{convert|40|ha|acre}} is located at the southern entrance to the city. Intended as a small neighbourhood, it must accommodate 1,400 units and {{convert|1800|m2|sqft}} of commercial space. Designed in 4 slices, together with its inhabitants, it entered the final phase of development in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens-amenagement.fr/Projets/Les-vergers-Paul-Claudel/Le-projet-urbain|title=ZAC Paul Claudel sur le site d'Amiens Aménagement}}</ref>
*ZAC Renancourt: This new quarter must ensure the development of the city to the west. Located between the Grâce Valley, the Selle Valley, the Renancourt quarter and its suburb, this planning area is a natural viewpoint over the city. It is also adjacent to emblematic facilities of the city: The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Zénith d'Amiens|Zénith d'Amiens|Zenith of Amiens}}, the [[Stade de la Licorne]] and the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Mégacité d'Amiens|Mégacité d'Amiens|megacity}}. By 2018, this residential area must accommodate 1,400 houses but also a hotel, facilities and shops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens-amenagement.fr/Projets/Renancourt/Le-projet-urbain|title=ZAC Renancourt|work=Amiens Aménagement}}</ref>
*[[Bus rapid transit]] (BRT): A project of three BRT lines is under consideration for commissioning in 2019, at the end of two years of work. Estimated at €85 million excluding taxes for {{convert|44|km|mi}}, the project would include the construction of a new bus depot and four [[park and ride]] stops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens.fr/actualite/3860/transport-bhns-cerise-sur-gateau-des-assises.html|title=Transport : le BHNS, cerise sur le gâteau des Assises|first1=Jean-Christophe|last1=Fouquet|date=11 February 2015|publisher=amiens.fr}}</ref> This project follows the cancellation of a tram project, which was endorsed by the municipal team in place between 2008 and 2014.

==Toponymy==
The [[toponym]] is derived from the name of the local Gallic people, the [[Ambiani]], which was replaced in the 4th century to the old name of the town {{Interlanguage link|fr|Samarobriva}} (the bridge on the Samara - Somme).

===Prehistory===
[[File:Biface de St Acheul MHNT.jpg|thumb|right|The Saint-Acheul axehead ({{Interlanguage link|fr|Félix Régnault}} collection, [[Muséum de Toulouse]]).]]

====Paleolithic====
The discovery of important prehistoric sites in Amiens contributed to the birth and growth of [[prehistory]], a young science which established itself in the second half of the 19th century. The region of Amiens has enormous potential for [[Quaternary]] [[geology]] and, more generally, for knowledge of the history of the first settlements in Europe.

The wealth and importance of the deposits in the suburbs of Saint-Acheul and Montieres, as well as the quality of the work of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Victor Commont}} and [[Jacques Boucher de Crèvecœur de Perthes|Jacques Boucher de Perthes]], considered the founder of prehistory, brought an international scientific reputation to the territory. As the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Vézère Valley|Vallée de la Vézère}} and the [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne]], the Somme Valley made reference to prehistory and to the study of the [[Paleolithic]].

It was at Amiens that, for the first time, was defined one of the most ancient civilisations of humanity: The [[Acheulean]]. In 1853, ''haches taillées'' [carved axes], according to the term of the time, were collected in the old alluvium of the Somme at the level of the suburb of Saint-Acheul, east of the city. This discovery fascinated the greatest international experts of the time, [[Joseph Prestwich]], [[Hugh Falconer]], [[Charles Lyell]] and [[John Evans (archaeologist)|John Evans]], who flocked to the site. In August 1859, [[Jean Albert Gaudry|Albert Gaudry]] discovered nine "[[Hand axe|carved axes]]" attesting, according to him, of the great antiquity of mankind. These discoveries marked the beginning of the great period of Saint-Acheul which lasted more than three-quarters of a century.

Between 1860 and 1880, 20,000 axeheads were thus collected. Saint-Acheul, whose fame became international, attracted many French and foreign specialists and collectors. This success gave rise to a lucrative trade of fake flints.

In 1872, [[Louis Laurent Gabriel de Mortillet|Gabriel de Mortillet]], who named the great periods of prehistory in France, decided to name the [[stone tool]]s gathered in large numbers at Saint-Acheul as Acheulean. The Amiens site then became the reference for the main features of the [[lower Palaeolithic]].

Today, the Saint-Acheul archaeological garden is open to the public<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.amiens-tourisme.com/accueil/en_un_clic/amiens_en_famille/que_faire_en_famille__1/le_jardin_archeologique_saint_acheul_a_amiens#.UZOAorV7K84|title= Le jardin archéologique Saint-Acheul à Amiens|work= amiens-tourisme.com|accessdate= 15 May 2013}}</ref> and presents a landscape of the former quarries which were classified as [[Monument historique|Historic Monuments]] in 1947.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://lesportesdutemps.culture.gouv.fr/lieux/jardin-archeologique-de-saint-acheul/|title=Jardin archéologique de Saint-Acheul, Amiens, Ville d’Art et d’Histoire |work= culture.gouv.fr|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>

In 2007, archaeological excavations, at the ''Rue du Manège'', uncovered the earliest traces of human occupation in Amiens, in an alluvial aquifer perched at {{convert|35|m|ft}} above the bottom of the current valley. The age of the remains collected during this intervention is dated to approximately 500,000 to 550,000 years ago.

====Mesolithic====
In 2006, when housing was under construction, excavations revealed [[Mesolithic]]<ref group="note">[[Mesolithic]] going from 9600 to 5500 BCE.</ref> sites on positions of ancient banks of the [[River Somme|Somme]] and the [[Selle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inrap.fr/userdata/c_bloc_file/3/3376/Inrap_RA_2006.pdf|title=Rapport d'activité 2006|work=Inrap|page=102}}</ref>

====Neolithic====
The [[Neolithic]] period the territory of Amiens has not been the subject of intensive research as the [[Paleolithic]]. However, a large deposit in the Montieres-Etouvie sector has delivered an extensive Neolithic [[Stone tool|industry]] with yellow flint of excellent craftsmanship.

Renancourt brickworks also updated important remains attributable to the Neolithic or [[Chalcolithic]], evidenced by the boat-shaped double axe exhibited at the [[Musée de Picardie]].

===Antiquity===

The first known settlement is Samarobriva ("Somme bridge"), mentioned for the first time in the ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' of [[Julius Caesar]]. Some forty years later, it was the central settlement of the [[Ambiani]], one of the [[List of peoples of Gaul|principal tribes of Gaul]], who were issuing coinage, probably from Amiens, in the 1st century BC. It was a large town which controlled the passage of the ''Via Agrippa'' connecting [[Lyon]] to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]]. The Ambiani derived their name from the Gaulish word ''ambe'', meaning river – a reference to the Somme that flows through Amiens.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=amiens+name+meaning&source=bl&ots=idwrH4LRYQ&sig=-Otn4ti-x3r9kSANzHsk7mfHqLg&hl=en&ei=CirITNzUGI70tgP5i6XpDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=amiens%20name%20meaning&f=false |title=Placenames of the world: origins and ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref> The town was given the name Ambianum by the Romans, meaning settlement of the Ambiani people. ''Samarobriu'' (''Samarobriva Ambianorum'') appears on the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]''.

By tradition, it was at the gates of Amiens that Saint [[Martin of Tours]], at the time still a Roman soldier, shared his cloak with a naked beggar.

Excavations near the city hall and the Palace of Justice revealed the foundations of the forum, the thermal baths and amphitheatre built for a population greater than that of either [[Londinium]] or [[Lutetia]]. During the late Roman Empire, the walled city was one of the main rear Roman bases facing the [[Migration Period|Barbarian Invasions]]. After Nero's death, it was a centre of equipment of [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and saw a flow of legionaries and merchants. The enclosure of the late Empire protected an area of {{convert|20|ha|acre}}.<ref>Gérard Coulon, ''Les Gallo-Romains : vivre, travailler, croire, se distraire - de 54 av. J.-C. à 486 ap. J.-C.''. Paris, Ed. Errance, 2006, Collection ''Hespérides'', ISBN 978-2-87772-331-2, p.21.</ref> The prosperity of the city made it a target for [[barbarian]] tribes such as the [[Alans]], the [[Burgundians]] or the [[Vandals]], who attacked the city several times. During the development of the ZAC de Renancourt in 2012, archaeologists (INRAP and Drac Picardie) excavated a Gallo-Roman rural area of {{convert|10|ha|acre}}, from after the conquest (1st and 2nd centuries). The occupation of the 1st century discovered ([[La Tène culture]]).

In 2006, during the construction of buildings in the Cathedral {{illm|Zone d'aménagement concerté|lt=ZAC|fr|Zone d'aménagement concerté}}, excavations were used to study a portion of the wall erected at the end of the 3rd century in Samarobriva.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inrap.fr/userdata/c_bloc_file/3/3376/Inrap_RA_2006.pdf|title=Rapport d'activité 2006 de l’Inrap|page=103}}</ref>

In 367, [[Valentinian I]] moved to Amiens to organise a maritime defence system, known as the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Tractus Armoricanus et Nervicanus}}. Valentinian I was proclaimed [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] along with his son [[Gratian]] the same year. Also in 367, it was from Amiens that [[Count Theodosius]] restored Roman order in Brittania.

In 383, in contrast, Amiens, like all towns in the area, was taken by [[Magnus Maximus]], proclaimed emperor by the legions in Britain.

During the 5th century, [[Chlodio]] rose to power among the [[Franks]], and [[Merovech]] was elected in Amiens by his comrades in arms. [[Honoratus of Amiens|Saint Honorius (Honoré)]] (d. 600 AD) became the seventh bishop of the city. [[Normans]] sacked the city 859 and again in 882. During the second sacking, the city's cathedral was burned. During the early part of the 10th century, Count Herbert de Vermandois united the regions of Amiens, Vexin, Laon, and Reims.<ref name="picardie.fr">[http://www.picardie.fr/en/applis/frise_en/frise_en.swf ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> In 1095, the people of Amiens began to form a rough municipal organization. In 1113, the municipality was sworn with the agreement of the Bishop and subsequently recognised by the King of France. Other cities in the region ([[Beauvais]], [[Cambrai]], [[Laon]], [[Noyon]], [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]]) moved up in the field of municipal liberties. On Palm Sunday 1115, King [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] was present in Amiens, to support Bishop Geoffroi and the residents against the Count [[Enguerrand I, Lord of Coucy|Enguerrand]] of [[County of Boves|Boves]] who refused to recognise the [[Medieval commune|communal]] institution. The city was joined to the Crown of France in 1185.

In 1218, lightning destroyed the archives of the bishopric and chapter, and destroyed the cathedral which had been rebuilt after the invasion of the Normans. In 1264, Amiens was chosen as the seat of arbitrations when King [[Louis IX of France]] settled the conflict between King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and his rebellious barons, led by [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester|Simon de Montfort]]. The arbitrations led to Louis deciding on the [[Mise of Amiens]] – a one-sided settlement in favor of Henry. This decision almost immediately led to the outbreak of the [[Second Barons' War|Barons' War]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Maddicott|first=John|authorlink=John Maddicott|title=Simon de Montfort|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1994|pages=257–8|isbn=0-521-37493-6}}</ref>

The blue of Amiens produced from woad (''[[Isatis tinctoria]]'') known as the ''Pastel des teinturiers et de waide'' [Pastel of dyers and of woad] in Picard, a dye plant, made the fortune of merchant woad producers, and the city, in the 12th and 13th centuries. The wealth generated by the proceeds from the sale of this [[dyeing|dye]] contributed to the financing of the reconstruction of the cathedral. Today, the heritage, cultural and economic exploitation of woad is still topical. Amiens is indeed the leader of the European cooperation project "beyond the blue - Woad: heritage and creation".

In 1435 the city was among the possessions granted to [[Philip the Good]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] by the [[Congress of Arras]]. It was re-acquired again by King [[Louis XI]] in 1477 after the death of [[Charles the Bold]].<ref name="picardie.fr"/> Louis XI authorised two annual [[fair]]s in Amiens, by its letters patent, so that not only the city gains but that it does not now encourage the flight of currency from the kingdom, due to the powerful fairs of [[Antwerp]] and [[Bruges]].

===Early Modern era===

On 11 March 1597, the Spanish attacked by surprise. The soldiers of Count [[Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo, Count of Fuentes|Pedro Henriquez de Acevedo]] of [[County of Fuentes|Fuentes]], disguised as peasants came before the gates of the walls with walnuts and apples. The hungry people of Amiens then opened the gates and the Spaniards entered and took over the city. After the six months of the [[Siege of Amiens (1597)|siege of Amiens]], [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] took over the city, putting an end to its autonomous rule.

During the 18th and 19th century, the textile tradition of Amiens became famous for its [[velours]]. The [[Cosserat]] family rose to prominence as one of the wealthiest of Amiens' textile manufacturing families. In 1789 the provinces of France were dismantled and the territory was organised into [[Departments of France|departments]]. Much of [[Picardy]] became the newly created department of [[Somme (department)|Somme]], with Amiens as the departmental capital.

===19th century===
[[File:La Paix d'Amiens de Jules-Claude Ziegler (1853).jpg|thumb|right|''La Paix d'Amiens'' by [[Jules-Claude Ziegler]] (1853).]]
In November 1801, British and French delegates began discussing terms of peace at the Amiens Congress. On 25 March 1802, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[First French Republic]] signed the [[Treaty of Amiens]] at the town hall, putting an end to the [[Second Coalition]] against France.

During the 19th century, Amiens began to feel the effects of the [[industrial revolution]], an became known worldwide thanks to the quality of its textile production. The city walls were demolished, opening up space for large boulevards around the town centre. The [[Henriville, Amiens|Henriville]] quarter in the south of the city was developed around this time, on the plots of the hospices of Amiens, far from the suburbs of Saint-Honore and Saint-Acheul. The ''Rue de la République'' was created and became a street of power and knowledge, with the erection of the municipal library and the Picardie Museum, as well as the installation of the prefecture.

In 1849, as in all the communes in France, the adult male population could, for the first time, vote through the introduction of [[universal suffrage]]. The city was hit by an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1866.

The first railway through Amiens was built in 1846, with the first station, known as ''[[Gare d'Amiens|Gare du Nord]]'': It allowed the city to connect to [[Paris]].<ref group="note">This is the current [[Paris–Lille railway]], which hasn't passed through the station of Amiens since March 1849, the month a direct connection to Longueau was commissioned.</ref> A second line opened from 1847 to [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]],<ref group="note">This is the current [[Longueau–Boulogne railway]].</ref> with [[Gare de Saint-Roch (Somme)|Gare Saint-Roch]]; then, in 1874,  the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Dépôt d'Amiens|Dépôt d'Amiens|Amiens locomotive depot}} was put into service. Some old ditches, adjacent to the city walls, were used for the passage of railway routes. This progress changed the geography of the city, which now turned away from the Somme, like the city hall which moved its entrance from the ''Place au fil'', to the current ''Rue des Trois-Cailloux''.

After this time, the city began to grow beyond the river and into the surrounding hills. During the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]], Somme was invaded by Prussian forces and Amiens was occupied.

Early science fiction author [[Jules Verne]] took up residence in Amiens in 1871, having met his wife there at a wedding in 1856. He was later elected city councilman in 1888.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://babelfish.yahoo.com/translate_url?trurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jules-verne.net%2F&lp=fr_en&.intl=us&fr=moz35 |title=Translation result for http://www.jules-verne.net/ |publisher=Babelfish.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref> In 1889, Jules Verne presided over the opening of the Amiens circus, including a courthouse, a police station and a museum dedicated to the history of Picardy.<ref name="picardie.fr"/>

In 1891, the network of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Former tramway of Amiens|Ancien tramway d'Amiens|former tramway of Amiens}} was created, originally horse-drawn, and then, from 1899, with electric traction. This network operated until its destruction during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940.

===Since 1900===

====From the Belle Epoque to the First World War====
[[File:Un concert par la Musique du 72e de ligne au Jardin Montplaisir à Amiens.jpg|thumb|left|A concert at the Montplaisir bandstand in 1908.]]
[[File:XVe congrès national corporatif.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque of the [[Charter of Amiens]] at the entrance of the Noyon primary school, ''Rue Rigollot''.]]

The tenth French town at the beginning of the 20th century, its population doubled between 1800 and 1900 from 41,000 to more than 90,000 inhabitants.<ref>Collectif, « Amiens Ville d’Art et d’Histoire – le guide ». «De la Belle Époque à la Première Guerre mondiale (1900-1918)», éditions du patrimoine, centre des monuments nationaux, 2007, pp.36-38.</ref> Given the need to accommodate the newcomers, the city transformed and enriched its heritage, especially valuing its centre, while retaining traces of its past with its plan leaving the imprint of the successive walls. The city extended first south and then north, especially in the Saint-Pierre quarter where many "Jacobins" houses were built.

The ''Nouvelles Galeries'', which opened their doors in 1895 on the ''Rue des Trois-Cailloux'', competed with small trade. In 1902, Henri {{Interlanguage link|fr|Devred 1902|Devred 1902|Devred}} installed his first ready-to-wear store in this iconic shopping street.

Beginning in 1905, Victor Commont, called "the founding father of modern Prehistoric science,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.somme-tourisme.com/uk/decouvrir/avisiter/archeologie/archeologie_saint-acheul.asp |title=Le Tourisme dans la Somme |publisher=Uk.somme-tourisme.com |date= |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref> performed important archaeological work in the Picardy area.<ref name="picardie.fr"/>

In 1906, the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|CGT]] held an historic congress which developed the [[Charter of Amiens]], signed on 13 October 1906, a constitution of French syndicalism defining its independence from political parties.

The Picardy capital was a vibrant city, rich with sports and cultural activities. Evidenced by the international exhibition held in July and August 1906 in the Park of the Hotoie with its 1.3 million visitors<ref>Benoît Delespierre, Lorsqu'Amiens accueillait son "village sénégalais", ''Le Courrier picard'' of 7 April 2013.</ref> or the [[French Grand Prix|Grand Prix of France]] in 1913 and its 100,000 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courrier-picard.fr/region/le-grand-prix-fete-son-centenaire-ia167b0n133470|title=Le Grand Prix fête son centenaire|date=12 July 2013 |work=Le Courrier picard|accessdate=12 July 2013}}</ref> The city had great intellectual activity with several influential scholarly societies, a varied press and a renowned theatre. The traditional, more aristocratic and popular festivals were many.

In 1913, the city had 38 clothing manufacturers. The Saint-Leu and Saint-Pierre quarters and the suburb of Hem dominated the textile industry, contrasting with the prosperity of the city centre and uptown by concentrating poverty and substandard housing.

With the declaration of war in the summer of 1914, Amiens, which geographical determinism placed to protect the capital, suffered the brunt of the horrors of war.

====First World War====
[[File:Amiens opération Michael mai 1918 première guerre mondiale.jpg|thumb|right|A general view of Amiens in May 1918, during Operation Michael.]]
At the start of the war, in August 1914, Amiens had been the Advance Base for the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]. It was captured by the German Army on 31 August 1914, but recaptured by the French on 28 September. The proximity of Amiens to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] and its importance as a rail hub, made it a vital British logistic centre, especially during the [[Battle of the Somme]] in 1916.<ref>{{cite web|author =Reading Room Manchester |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/20902/ST.%20PIERRE%20CEMETERY,%20AMIENS |title=Commonwealth War Graves Commission – ST. PIERRE CEMETERY, AMIENS – Historical Information |publisher=Cwgc.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> The city was to the immediate rear of the Allied front during most of the war. With 93,000 inhabitants at the start of the war, the population increased to 110,000 during the conflict because of the presence of Allied troops. The population and industries suffered heavy privations (gas, coal, bread, etc.), leading to several strikes, twenty-five alone in 1917. Facing regular bombings, the municipality implemented measures for the protection of historical monuments, such as the cathedral, as early as 1915.

Amiens was one of the key objectives of the German [[Spring Offensive]] which was launched on 27 March 1918 as [[Second Battle of the Marne|Operation Michael]]. The German 2nd Army pushed back the British 5th Army, who fought a series of defensive actions. Eventually, on 4 April, the Germans succeeded in capturing [[Villers-Bretonneux]] which overlooked Amiens, only for it to be retaken by an Australian counterattack that night. This was also stopped by the Canadian Cavalry brigade ([[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)]]) at Villers-Bretonneux and [[Moreuil]]. During the fighting, Amiens was bombarded by German artillery and aircraft; more than 2,000 buildings were destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ww1westernfront.gov.au/amiens-cathedral/victory-medal.html |title=Australians on the Western Front – France 1918: Defence of Amiens |publisher=Ww1westernfront.gov.au |date=1918-09-07 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>

In August, the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] of Field-Marshal Sir [[Douglas Haig]] led the offensive which would become the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]]. The attack was intended to release a large part of the railway line between Paris and Amiens. On 8 August 1918, a successful Allied counter stroke, the battle took place and was the opening phase of the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], which led directly to the [[Armistice with Germany]] which ended the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/battles_amiens.html |title=History of War – Rickard, J (5 September 2007), '&#39;Battle of Amiens, 8 August-3 September 1918'&#39; |publisher=Historyofwar.org |date= |accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

At the end of the [[First World War]], the civilian toll was 152 killed and 213 wounded, property damage included 731 buildings completely destroyed and nearly 3,000 damaged, in addition to looting.<ref>Albert Chatelle, ''Amiens pendant la guerre 1914-1918''.</ref>

A reconstruction plan was arranged by {{Interlanguage link|fr|Louis Duthoit}}, replaced in 1921.{{who|date=June 2015}} In 1924, the State rejected the request for war damages made by the municipality. A less ambitious reconstruction began in 1925, as evidenced by a few [[Art Deco]] façades.

====Second World War====
{{main|Operation Jericho}}
The rebuilding of downtown was not complete from already being heavily hit during the First World War, the city was again stricken by many bombings during the [[Second World War]], in 1940, particularly during the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Battle of Amiens (1940)|Bataille d'Amiens (1940)|Battle of Amiens}} in early June. During the [[Battle of France]], Amiens was reached by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army's]] [[1st Panzer Division (Wehrmacht)|1st Panzer Division]] on 20 May 1940, following two days of heavy air raids. The Germans gradually penetrated the city and two other armoured divisions supported the offensive. French and British units were installed in positions to the south of Amiens, and discharged field guns upon the city on 5 June. A last offensive of German armour in numeric superiority, committed from 6 to 8 June, overcame the Franco-British lock, the city definitely fell on 8 June and the Wehrmacht continued its breakthrough in the direction of its next target, [[Paris]]. However, the German losses were high: Nearly 200 tanks. Despite the later fighting, the cathedral and a few neighbourhoods were spared, including those Henriville and Saint-Leu. It had been defended by a battalion, the [http://www.7throyalsussex.org.uk/home.php 7th Battalion], [[Royal Sussex Regiment]], a [[Army Reserve (United Kingdom)|Territorial]] infantry battalion of the [[British Army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/UK/UK-NWE-Flanders/UK-NWE-Flanders-5.html |title=Major L.

In 1942, the first reconstruction plans were underway by German officials, and by [[Pierre Dufau]].

On 4 January 1944, the Germans initiated an organised round-up, which resulted in the arrests of 21 Amiens Jews, joined by Jews from the Department. First held in [[Drancy internment camp]], most were deported to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]] by Convoy no. 66. There was only a single Amiens survivor, from this convoy, at the end of the war: Renée Louria, who recounted his terrible fate in the ''Courrier Picard'' in May 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courrier-picard.fr/region/la-rafle-du-4-janvier-1944-commemoree-hier-ia167b0n281742|title=La rafle du 4 janvier 1944 commémorée hier|date=6 January 2014|work=Le Courrier picard|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref>

On 18 February 1944, British aircraft bombed the prison in Amiens as part of [[Operation Jericho]]. The raid was intended to aid the escape of members of the [[French Resistance]] and political prisoners being held there. In all, 258 prisoners escaped.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spitfiresite.com/2010/03/operation-jericho.html |accessdate=29 May 2010 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Prior to the [[Normandy landings]] of 6 June 1944, Allied aircraft concentrated on disabling communications in [[occupied France]], and the railway junction at [[Longueau]] to the south east of Amiens was attacked by 200 bombers of the [[Royal Air Force]] on the night of the 12 and 13 June. There was much damage in the town itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aerial.rcahms.gov.uk/database/record.php?usi=006-000-001-185-C |title=The National Collection of Aerial Photography: Sortie 106G/3133 – Longueau railway depot |publisher=Aerial.rcahms.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> Amiens was liberated on 31 August 1944 by the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|11th Armoured Division]], part of [[XXX Corps (United Kingdom)|30 Corps]] commanded by [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Brian Horrocks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1060024055 |title=IWM Collections – 30TH CORPS CAPTURES AMIENS |publisher=Iwm.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>

====Post-war period====
{{main|Tour Perret (Amiens)|Gare d'Amiens}}

The city was rebuilt according to Pierre Dufau's plans, the reconstruction and development plan was adopted as early as July 1942. With a focus on widening the streets to ease traffic congestion. These newer structures were primarily built of brick, concrete and white stone with slate roofs. The ''Place Gambetta'' was furnished by the architect Alexandre Courtois, the architect [[Auguste Perret]] designed the [[Gare d'Amiens]] railway station, the ''Place de la Gare'', and the nearby [[Tour Perret (Amiens)|Tour Perret]]. Meanwhile, Dufau focussed on the market square and the cathedral square.<ref>Joseph Abram, ''L'Architecture moderne en France. Du chaos à la croissance, 1940-1966'', éd. Picard, 1999, p.28-31.</ref>

On 2 June 1960, the new region of [[Picardy]] was formed from the [[Departments of France|department]]s of [[Aisne]], [[:Oise]] and [[Somme (department)|Somme]].<ref name="picardie.fr"/>

A wind of protest which blew over France and the world at the end of the 1960s, also affected Amiens. First, a demonstration opposing the [[Vietnam War]] was organised on 21 October 1967. Then, while the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Maison de la culture d'Amiens|Maison de la culture d'Amiens|House of Culture}} hosted the National Education Minister [[Alain Peyrefitte]] in mid-March 1968, at a symposium on education, Amiens students followed suit from the events in Paris by marching in protest on 6 and 7 May. Factory and the railway workers in the city joined them a few days later on 17 May. The next day, the [[Gare de Longueau|Longueau]] railwaymen blocked [[Railroad switch|points]], [[Ferodo]] workers occupied their factory from 20 May for five weeks.

Although not experiencing clashes comparable to those in Paris, the city was quickly paralysed. The absence of household waste collection gave the streets a foul odour, and the department was short of petrol from 22 May. Against this movement of left, the extreme right was not absent: While militants had thrown an explosive device in protest at the Communist permanence of the city on 23 December 1967, members of [[Occident (movement)|Occident]] opposed students on 21 May, in front of the Picardy cinema. During the night of 27–28 May, students tried to take the House of Culture. In the aftermath of President [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s radio address, his supporters in Amiens demonstrated in the streets on 31 May, while recovery was committed the following week. Faure law promulgated, the [[University of Amiens]] was created on 26 October,<ref>Antoine Caux, Jean-Christophe Fouquet et Nicolas Lejeune, « 2008, souvenirs de mai », ''JDA Métropole'' no.487 of 28 May 2008.</ref> founded on a campus in the southwestern suburbs of the city.

====Since the 1970s====
The city suffered the loss of many jobs as manufacturing plants in the region closed during the late 1970s and 1980s. Despite the hardships, the city made an effort to renovate the degraded area of St-Leu during this time.

The 1990s saw a great period of rebirth in the city. The St-Leu renovations were completed, the parc Saint-Pierre was redesigned and part the [[University of Picardie Jules Verne|University of Picardy]] moved into new buildings in the city centre. The ''Vallée des Vignes'' commercial district was developed in the south of the city, and large parts of the city center were converted to pedestrian areas.

Since 2006, there has been a comprehensive programme for the restructuring of the station quarter, the ''Gare la Vallée'' project, is in progress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens.fr/fichiers/6490/Gare%20-%20la%20Vall%E9e.pdf|title=Amiens Gare la Vallée|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://www.amiens.fr/fichiers/6490/Gare%2520-%2520la%2520Vall%25E9e.pdf&title=lien%20vers%20la%20plaquette%20de%20pr%C3%A9sentation|archivedate=2015-06-21}}</ref> Since June 2008, the vast architectural transformation of the station square facilitates access to the station for people with reduced mobility and pedestrian continuity between the city hall and the station. The Gare du Nord has been renovated with a controversial new glass roof. The [[wiktionary:Tour Perret|Tour Perret]] was renovated as well and a new cinema complex was built, reorganising the area around the railway station.

It should be noted that on the same date, the site of the Communauté d'agglomération does cite only three twinnings with Dortmund, Görlitz and Darlington and does not cite the twinning with Bergen. Similarly, it cited the contract of partnership with Lviv, but none of the other partnerships, and adds a partnership with [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens.fr/institutions/villes-jumelles/|title=Villes jumelles|work=Communauté d'agglomération|accessdate=12 November 2013}}</ref>

Furthermore, in 1997, a cooperation agreement and a twinning charter signed between Amiens and the Chinese city of [[Mianyang]]. These were renewed in 2014 with aims to bring the two cities closer on various levels: economic, cultural, scientific, etc.<ref>

==Population and society==

===Demography===
The inhabitants of Amiens are called the ''Amiénois''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.habitants.fr/|title=Nom des habitants des communes françaises|work=habitants.fr of Lionel Delvarre}}</ref> and their {{Interlanguage link|fr|nom jeté}} is ''Chés maqueux d'gueugues'' (the eaters of nuts).

The population of Amiens has risen sharply since the mid-19th century: Its population doubled between 1850 and 1960, from 50,000 to 100,000 inhabitants, i.e. a gain of 50,000 people over this period of 110 years, and gaining about 30,000 others since (over 50 years only this time).

====Demographic evolution====
In 2012, the commune had 132,727 inhabitants. The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses carried out in the town since 1793. From the 21st century, the communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants census takes place every year as a result of a sample survey, unlike the other communes which have a real census every five years.<ref group="note">At the beginning of the 21st century, the terms of census have been amended by [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000593100&fastPos=1&fastReqId=2036940488&categorieLien=cid&oldAction=rechTexte Act No. 2002-276 of 27 February 2002], called "grassroots democracy law" on the democracy of proximity and in particular Title V "of census operations", in order, after a power transition period from 2004 to 2008, the annual publication of the legal population of the different French administrative districts. For municipalities with populations greater than 10,000 inhabitants, a sample survey is carried out annually, the entire territory of these municipalities is included at the end of the same period of five years. The first post-legal population from 1999, and fitting in the new system which came into force on 1 January 2009, is the census of 2006.</ref><ref group="note">In the census table, by Wikipedia convention, the principle was retained for subsequent legal populations since 1999 not to display the census populations in the table corresponding to the year 2006, the first published legal population calculated according to the concepts defined in Decree No. 2003-485 of 5 June 2003, and the years corresponding to an exhaustive census survey for municipalities with less than 10,000 inhabitants, and the years 2006, 2011, 2016, etc. For municipalities with more than 10,000, the latest legal population is published by INSEE for all municipalities.</ref>

*South Hospital, ''Avenue René-Laënnec''
*North Hospital, ''Place Victor-Pauchet''
*Saint-Victor Centre, 354 ''Bis Boulevard de Beauville''
*Obstetrics and Gynaecology Centre, 124 ''Rue Camille-Desmoulins''

From 2014, the four sites were gradually gathered on the current site of the South Hospital, with the exception of the long stay units for the elderly remaining in the Saint-Victor Centre. This merger will be completed in 2016 and allow the CHU of Amiens to increase its national and inter-regional dimension. This group represents the largest hospital construction of France and one of the most important in Europe (more than €630 million of work and equipment). At the end of the work, the total space of the CHU of Amiens will be {{convert|172000|m2|sqft}}. It will count three blocks of hospitalisation with 400 beds each. The CHU of Amiens is the largest employer in the [[Picardy]] region. At the end of the merger, there will be 6,700 employees, 1,300 students of the professions of health and 1,250 consultants who will go there each day.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://amiens.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/communication/publications/amiens-forum/AF28.pdf |title= Quel accès pour notre hôpital ?|date= February 2012 |work= Amiens Forum |accessdate= 16 May 2013}}</ref>

In order to maintain a supply of health to the north of the city, a health centre will open its doors in the first quarter of 2016, at the crossroads of the ''Avenue de l'Europe'' and the ''Rue Maurice-Ravel''. This health space of {{convert|1200|m2|sqft}} will host general practitioners and specialists of the CHU (cardiologist, a service of gynaecology-obstetrics, psychologists, dentist, masseurs-physiotherapists, etc.) with the promise of a {{Interlanguage link|fr|permanence of care|Permanence des soins}} (7 days a week and 24 hours a day).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://fr.calameo.com/read/0012028354a62d519eecb|title=Des soins au plus près des habitants|first=Lysiane|last=Voisin|date=|journal=JDA|issue=140|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

Alongside the CHU, there are three private clinics, resulting from the consolidation of old clinics in the city. These care and hospitalisation institutions for medical, surgical, and obstetrics came together to create a private hospital centre in the Vallée des Vignes quarter, south of the city.

*Polyclinic of Picardy, 43 ''Rue Alexandre Dumas''
*Clinic of Europe, 5 ''Allée des Pays-Bas''
*Victor Pauchet Heath Group, 2 ''Avenue Irlande''

The CHU of Amiens figured in 11th place in the ''2013 awards of the hospitals and clinics'' of the magazine ''[[Le Point]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.courrier-picard.fr/region/le-chu-d-amiens-bien-note-dans-le-classement-des-hopitaux-ia0b0n167893|title=Le CHU d'Amiens bien noté dans le classement des hôpitaux du " Point "|date=27 August 2013|work=Le Courrier picard|accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref> In this ranking, the CHU stands out for ankle surgery (3rd), hip prosthesis (5th), foot surgery (7th) and paediatrics (14th). In this same classification, the Victor Palmer Health Group, equipped with a solid "mother-to-child hub", gained a 5th place in the table for the gynaecological clinics and an 8th place for breast cancers.

Agriculture has very little representation among Amiens jobs with only 0.2%, just as the construction sector which represents 3.0% of jobs. Unlike these two sectors whose share is below the national average, the tertiary sector represents a significant part of the Amiens workforce, 19.8%, and is more important than at the national level. Industry includes 17.4% of jobs.

The [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company]] announced more than 400 {{Interlanguage link|fr|Unemployment in France|Chômage en France|job cuts}} in May 2008 at the Amiens plant, which has had 1,450 employees; in March 2009, the management announced new {{Interlanguage link|fr|Plan of safeguarding of employment|Plan de sauvegarde de l'emploi|collective redundancies}} of a thousand jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2009/03/18/04015-20090318ARTFIG00576-goodyear-amiens-la-restructuration-se-durcit-.php|title=Goodyear Amiens : la restructuration se durcit|work=Le Figaro|date=18 March 2009}}</ref>

===Businesses and shops===

On 31 December 2010, at Amiens, there were 9,166 businesses: 69 in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, 402 in industry, 533 in construction, 6,111 in trade, transportation and various services and 2,051 were related to the administrative sector.<ref group="Insee" name="CEN T1">''CEN T1 - Active establishments by sector of activity on 31 December 2010''.</ref>

In 2011, 743 companies were established at Amiens,<ref group="Insee">''DEN T1 - Créations d'entreprises par secteur d'activité en 2011''.</ref> including 417 by of [[Sole proprietorship|sole proprietors]].<ref group="Insee">''DEN T2 - Créations d'entreprises individuelles par secteur d'activité en 2011''.</ref>

[[Philately|Philatelic]] publishers [[Yvert et Tellier]] (catalogues of quotes) and ''[[l'Écho de la timbrologie]]'' (magazine) have their management in Amiens, even if they have more of their services in the Paris region. The [[Gueudet]] Group, one of the largest car dealers in France, was established at Amiens in 1918. The old textile tradition of the city remains with the factory of [[Lee Cooper]] France (122 employees).

Since the end of [[World War II]], much of the city's economy was related to automotive equipment with companies such as [[Valeo]], [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] and [[Sumitomo Group|Sumitomo]]-[[Dunlop Tyres|Dunlop]] tyres. In 2003, Dunlop was bought by the American Goodyear company, these two companies through late 2007 and early 2008 had a deep crisis, the headquarters in the United States having "offered" to workers a change of their working hours and the number of posts, which was refused by the staff at a high percentage.

[[Procter & Gamble]], settled at Amiens in 1964 to produce soap and inaugurated its new detergents unit in 1966. Established over more than {{convert|45|ha|acre}}, it is one of the largest factories in the world for laundry cleaning products ([[Ariel (detergent)|Ariel]], Dash, Bonux, Gama) and for around the house ([[Mr. Clean]], [[Febreze]]). More than 85% of its production is intended for export. The Amiens plant employs approximately 930 people.

Since the mid-1990s, the city has tried to convert to the economy of the internet and telephony. Many [[call centre]]s (Intracall center, Coriolis France, [[Médiamétrie]])<ref>Insee, ''Picardie : diagnostic et perspectives'', chapitre ''Dynamiques économiques'', p.36, 2006.</ref> have opened mainly within the city, region or state. The Unilog (now [[Logica]]) computer service company has installed a service centre in Amiens (the CSA).

Amiens is the seat of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Regional Chamber of commerce and industry of Picardy|Chambre régionale de commerce et d'industrie de Picardie}}. It is also the seat of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Chamber of commerce and industry of Amiens|Chambre de commerce et d'industrie d'Amiens}}. It manages the [[Amiens - Glisy Aerodrome]].

==Culture, tourism and heritage==
{{main|{{Interlanguage link|fr|List of historic monuments of Amiens|Liste des monuments historiques d'Amiens}}}}

The strategic position of Amiens makes it an attractive destination for a weekend or a few days, from [[Paris]], [[Lille]] or [[Brussels]]. Amiens also benefits from the proximity of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Baie de Somme}}, a tourist hotspot registered at the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Club des plus belles baies du monde}} and labelled {{Interlanguage link|fr|Label Grand Site de France|Label Grand Site de France|Great Site of France}}.

Amiens has the label of [[French Towns and Lands of Art and History|Towns and Lands of Art and History]] since 1992. Within this framework, the host of the heritage organises guided tours to themes intended for an audience of adults and children with educational workshops. A signposted circuit allows an independent tour of the town, with information panels offering comment on places and notable buildings.

Amiens has an important historical and cultural heritage, an accessible and varied natural heritage, on which tourism is based. The main attractions are the cathedral, which is included in the world heritage of [[UNESCO]], the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Hortillonnages d'Amiens|Hortillonnages d'Amiens|hortillonnages}}, {{Interlanguage link|fr|Maison de Jules Verne|Maison de Jules Verne|Jules Verne House}}, the [[Tour Perret (Amiens)|Tour Perret]], the [[Musée de Picardie]], the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Zoo d'Amiens|Zoo d'Amiens|zoo}}, and the quarters of Saint-Leu and Saint-Maurice.

===Places and monuments===
The commune has an exceptional heritage: 53 monuments listed in the [[Monument historique|inventory of monuments historiques]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=INSEE&DOM=MH&VALUE_1=80021|title=Architecture|work=Merimee|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> and 126 places and monuments listed in the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Inventaire général du patrimoine culturel|Inventaire général du patrimoine culturel|general inventory of cultural heritage}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=INSEE&DOM=INV&VALUE_1=80021|title=Architecture|work=Merimee|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> and on the other hand, 263 objects listed in the inventory of monuments historiques<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/palissy_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=INSEE&DOM=MH&VALUE_1=80021|title=Mobilier|work=Palissy|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> and 122 objects listed in the general inventory of cultural heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/palissy_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=INSEE&DOM=INV&VALUE_1=80021|title=Mobilier|work=Palissy|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> The information given below is relative only to a brief selection.

====Notre-Dame d'Amiens====
{{main|Amiens Cathedral}}
[[File:Cathédrale Notre-Dame d'Amiens-3420.jpg|thumb|right|Façade of Notre-Dame Cathedral]]

{{pull quote|It's a lovely woman, this Cathedral is a Virgin. ... Point of vain confusion, here, point of exaggeration or swelling. It is absolutely empirical of supreme elegance.|author =[[Auguste Rodin]]}}

{{pull quote|Amiens Cathedral deserves the name given by [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|M. Viollet-le-Duc]], 'the [[Parthenon]] of Gothic architecture'.|author =[[John Ruskin]]|source=The Bible of Amiens}}

The city is famous for its Notre-Dame Cathedral, masterpiece of [[Gothic art]] and the largest cathedral in the world by its interior volume ({{convert|200,000|m3|cuft}}).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.francetv.fr/culturebox/amiens-la-cathedrale-en-couleurs-58273 |title= Amiens, la cathédrale en couleurs|date= 18 June 2011 |work=France Télévisions|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref> The largest religious and medieval building of France, its interior could twice hold [[Notre Dame de Paris]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.routard.com/guide_voyage_lieu/10252-cathedrale_notre_dame_d_amiens.htm |title= Cathédrale Notre-Dame d'Amiens|work=Guide du routard|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>

The cathedral measures {{convert|145|m|ft}} long and its spire rises {{convert|112|m|ft}} high. The vaults of the central [[nave]], finished in 1247, are {{convert|42.3|m|ft}} (close to the maximum limit for this architecture).

Dating back to the 13th century, its construction is due to the wealth of the city in the Middle Ages and the fire of the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] cathedral which stood previously. Three architects, including [[Robert of Luzarches]] succeeded to complete the construction.

Amiens Cathedral is notable for the coherence of its plan, the beauty of its three-tier interior elevation, the particularly fine display of sculptures on the principal façade and in the south transept, and other inlays of its floor. It is also described by [[John Ruskin]] as "Gothic, clear of Roman tradition and of Arabian taint, Gothic pure, authoritative, unsurpassable, and unaccusable."

Regarded as the archetype of the classic [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, the cathedral also presents some elements of the radiant Gothic style and flamboyant Gothic. The speed of construction, barely 70 years for the shell (1220 to 1269), explains this remarkable homogeneity of style. Its façade is decorated with more 3,000 statues, gargoyles and chimeras.

Registered since 1981 as a [[World Heritage Site]] of [[UNESCO]] as a "masterpiece of world heritage", it is a second time in 1998 as a monumental step on the [[Camino de Santiago (route descriptions)|Camino de Santiago]]. Despite the two World Wars of the 20th century, which severely affected the city, it managed to stay intact.

A show of the reproduction of the original polychromy<ref>Unlike most cathedrals in France, Notre Dame Amiens has substantially retained all of its original statues and ornaments, which even today allows one to admire some of the colours used in Middle Ages.</ref> of façades, discovered as a result of recent [[laser]] cleaning, is given annually for free in December and during the summer period. The show is a projection on the façade of slides in color.

The {{Interlanguage link|fr|Zodiaque de la cathédrale d'Amiens|Zodiaque de la cathédrale d'Amiens|zodiac}} is a set of reliefs on the foundations of the western façade formed series of quatrefoil medallions, carved in a representative agrarian calendar and the signs of the zodiac.

The statue of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|L'Ange pleureur|L'Ange pleureur|weeping Angel}} (on a tomb carved by {{Interlanguage link|fr|Nicolas Blasset}}) and the reliefs evoking Saint-Firmin and St. John the Baptist are some of the well-known works of the Cathedral.

At ground level lies the intact {{Interlanguage link|fr|Labyrinthe de la cathédrale d'Amiens|Labyrinthe de la cathédrale d'Amiens|labyrinth}} of {{convert|234|m|ft}} long.

On the north side of the cathedral is the former {{Interlanguage link|fr|Palais de l'évêché d'Amiens|Palais de l'évêché d'Amiens|Palace of the Bishop of Amiens}}, occupied by the {{Interlanguage link|fr|École supérieure de commerce d'Amiens|École supérieure de commerce d'Amiens|École supérieure de commerce}} in Amiens.

====The belfry====
[[File:Le Beffroi Amiens FRA 001.jpg|thumb|right|The belfry of Amiens]]
{{main|{{Interlanguage link|fr|Belfry of Amiens|Beffroi d'Amiens}}}}

Its origin dates back to the establishment of the commune of Amiens by [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]]. It is mentioned for the first time in an arbitral award issued by the chapter of Amiens in 1244.

Symbolising the independence of the commune, it was formerly used for meetings of the notables of the city and then as archive rooms, weapons store and prison. A spotter nearby monitored arrivals and warned the population of the external dangers. During the Middle Ages, the building was repeatedly engulfed by fire.

The belfry is composed of a base in white cut stone, built in the 15th century between 1406 and 1410, a stone superstructure bell tower built from 1749 with Baroque [[volute]]s at its base, and a dome covered with slate and then an arrow and a weather vane with a [[pheme|renown]]. At the time, a huge 11-ton bell was installed inside, it was later destroyed along with the dome (as a result of the melting of the copper component) in the bombardment and fire of the city on 19 May 1940. Abandoned and devoid of a roof since [[World War II]], the monument was fully restored between February 1989 and July 1990.

Located on the ''Place au Fil'', the old central square of the city before the arrival of the railway and the rise of the ''Rue des Trois Calloux'', the belfry is adjacent to ''Les Halles'' and the back of the city hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=PA00116043|title=Architecture|work=Merimee|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> At a height of {{convert|52|m|ft}}, it rings every hour of the day.

Since July 2005, the belfry of Amiens (recorded in the inventory of Historic Monuments) is, as [[Amiens Cathedral|Notre Dame Cathedral]], classed among the world heritage of [[UNESCO]].

====Cirque Jules-Verne====
{{main|{{Interlanguage link|fr|Cirque Jules-Verne}}}}

[[File:Cirque Amiens foule début XXe.jpg|thumb|left|The municipal circus of Amiens in 1912, on the festival of Saint Jean.]]
[[File:Cirque municipale amiens.jpg|thumb|The municipal circus of Amiens in 2006.]]

In 1845, the traditional fair of Saint-Jean, formerly held at ''Place René Goblet'', was transferred to ''Place Longueville'', a wide esplanade taking the place of the Longueville bastion since the demolition of the walls of the city in the early 19th century. Each year, a temporary circus was established on this occasion.

In 1865, a circus company emerged to claim a permanent circus, which would be built in wood by the Schytte contractor in 1874. However, expensive maintenance prompted the municipality to consider the construction of a new building. The decision was taken in 1886 under the leadership of Mayor [[Frédéric Petit (politician)|Frédéric Petit]] and the work began.

The Chief Architect of the Somme, {{Interlanguage link|fr|Émile Ricquier}}, a disciple of [[Gustave Eiffel]], was responsible for its construction. It was inspired by the [[Cirque d'hiver]] of Paris but chose a cast metal frame, supplemented by brick from the local countryside. The architect of civil buildings, [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], claimed that the frames should be hidden with a plaster imitating stone. The "moderninst" design of Ricquier, who chose to display the structure, and to favour local material such as brick, is visible at the rear of the monument.

With its 16-sided polygonal shape, with a diameter of {{convert|44|m|ft}}, it includes lodges and [[Choir (architecture)#Seating|stalls]] in its enclosure. Modern, it hosts two steam engines dedicated fully electric lights and central heating. Since its construction, it has also been the first circus which included a buffet and a refreshment bar. The cost of the construction of the building finally reached double the forecast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/public/mistral/merimee_fr?ACTION=CHERCHER&FIELD_1=REF&VALUE_1=IA80000169|title=Inventaire général du patrimoine culturel|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref> In 1888, the new city councillor responsible for festivals and celebrations, Jules Verne, was responsible for monitoring the work, and it was he who opened it on Sunday 23 June 1889, for the opening of the fair and the centenary of the French Revolution:<ref>Jules Verne, extrait du {{cite web|url=http://www.phys.uu.nl/~gdevries/etexts/cirque/cirque.html|title=discours d'inauguration}} du 23 juin 1889.</ref>

{{pull quote|The new circus is a work of art that your municipal administration wanted to build with all of the enhancements of the modern industry. It is the most best, undoubtedly, it is also the most comprehensive with its facilities and equipment which have been built in France and abroad.|author =[[Jules Verne]]}}

The roof was damaged by a shell in 1916. The circus was the setting for [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[The Clowns (film)|The Clowns]]'' (1971), and the film by [[Jean-Jacques Beineix]], ''[[Roselyne et les lions]]'' (1989), with [[Isabelle Pasco]] as lead actress. The largest of the circuses of the province with its 3,000-seats, the building has acquired a multidisciplinary use for decades of performances of theatre, dance, concerts, galas, sports and public meetings.

====The Hortillonages====
Amiens is also known for the {{Ill|fr|hortillonnages|Hortillonnages d'Amiens}}, gardens on small islands in over {{convert|300|ha|acre}} of marshland between the [[River Somme]] and [[Avre (Somme)|River Avre]], surrounded by a grid network of man-made canals (locally known as "rieux").

Hortillon means [[market garden]] in Picard, and derives from the Latin ''hortillus'', small garden. It is circulated in flat bottom boats, formerly called ''barque à cornet'' [Cornet boat], due to the very raised front, which allows the boats to easily dock on the fragile shores of the cultivated fields. It is the port of upstream, located at the foot of the cathedral where a weekly market is held on the water, although the arrival by boat of the growers can be accomplished only once a year, in summer.

===Amiens and music===
[[File:The rabeats sly flamm marcelo.JPG|thumb|right|The Rabeats]]
Even if it rarely achieves national notoriety (with the notable exceptions of [[Les Fatals Picards]], {{interlanguage link|fr|The Rabeats}}, [[Olympe (singer)|Olympe]], [[Albin de la Simone]], [[Disiz]] and [[Rokia Traoré]]), the Amiens music scene is active and developed. In this dynamic, the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Nouvelle scène rock française|Nouvelle scène rock française|New French Rock}} scene holds a central place and is organised around a collective as ''Amiens Burning'', which is responsible for networking the breeding ground for the local rock scene, to accompany it in its projects, and organise concerts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Association Amiens Burning|work=Maison des associations d'Amiens Métropole|accessdate=19 November 2012|url=http://www.maam.fr/association/amiens-burning}}</ref>

Since their creation, {{Interlanguage link|fr|La Lune des Pirates}} or Cité Carter also provide support to the local scene. For example, the Cité Carter each year produces a compilation with the groups which repeat within its structure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Discographie de la Cité Carter|work=Ville d'Amiens|accessdate=20 November 2012|url=http://w2.amiens.com/lesafran/discographie.htm}}</ref>

The city has the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Conservatoire à rayonnement régional d'Amiens}}, seat of strong musical activity (framed by 70 teachers, an administrative and technical team with an additional 20 people).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amiens.fr/vie-quotidienne/culture/conservatoire/conservatoire.html|title=Conservatoire à Rayonnement Régional|work=amiens.fr|accessdate=24 January 2014}}</ref>

===Amiens and literature===
Amiens saw rise, over the centuries, major writers.<ref>Collectif, « Amiens Ville d’Art et d’Histoire – le guide ». « Vie littéraire à Amiens sous l’ancien Régime » et « La vie littéraire au siècle XIX », éditions du patrimoine, centre des monuments nationaux, 2007, p.26 and p.35.</ref> In the first half of the 17th century, [[Vincent Voiture]], poet and letter writer, was the darling of the [[Précieuses]] for the fluidity of his style. In 1634, he was member of the 1st [[Académie française]]. In 1678, [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange]], nicknamed "the French [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]]", published his ''Glossarium'' in 3 volumes. This glossary of medieval Latin is still authoritative today. In 1750, [[Jean-Baptiste-Louis Gresset|Jean Baptiste Gresset]], playwright and poet, celebrated in his time and member of the [[Académie française]], founded the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Académie des sciences, des lettres et des arts d'Amiens|Académie des sciences, des lettres et des arts d'Amiens|Academy of Amiens}} which is still active today and he was named perpetual president.

In 1782, the Amiens native [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos|Choderlos de Laclos]] published ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'' where he staged a depraved nobility. Considered one of the masterpieces of 18th-century literature, the book has toured the world and is known as an [[Dangerous Liaisons|Oscar-winning film adaptation]].

{{pull quote|Here I am quite citizen of Amiens. It seems to me that I was born. I live very happy, although uncomfortable to work. Amiens is a wise city, even-tempered, and the company is friendly and literate. It is near Paris, close enough to have the highlights without unbearable noise and bustle.|author =[[Jules Verne]]}}

[[File:Firma de Julio Verne.svg|thumb|right|The signature of Jules Verne]]

In the 19th century, there was a brilliant literary life around the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Académie des sciences, des lettres et des arts d'Amiens}} with historian [[Albéric de Calonne]] and the [[Yvert et Tellier#Genealogy of the Yvert family|Yvert family]]. However, the great name of Amiens literary life is [[Jules Verne]]. He animated all intellectual activity, giving balls and parties, while his wife held a famous [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]. He often attended the library of the industrial society, which subscribed to numerous scientific journals. A member of the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts of Amiens from 8 March 1872, he was elected Director in 1875, and in 1881 and, on this occasion, he delivered several speeches of welcome, especially for one of his friends, Amiens cartoonist {{Interlanguage link|fr|Gédéon Baril}}, who signed illustrations of {{Interlanguage link|fr|Dix heures en chasse}} with [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel|Hetzel]]. Engaged in local life, he was Councillor of Amiens from 1888 to 1904. He was closely interested in the affairs of the city, wrote many reports on the theatre and brought its support to the construction of the {{Interlanguage link|fr|Cirque Jules-Verne|Cirque Jules-Verne|municipal circus}}.

Amiens does appear explicitly in his novels but there are however characteristic elements of the city such as the cathedral and the river. This is the case, for example, for the imaginary city of Ragz in ''Le secret de Wilhem Storitz''. In the novel ''Une fantaisie du docteur Ox'', the inhabitants of the fictional town of Virgamen, the Virgamenois, refer directly to the Amiénois and their prudent nature.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedie.picardie.fr/index.php/Dans_les_pas_de_Jules_Verne_%C3%A0_Amiens|title= Dans les pas de Jules Verne à Amiens|first=Anne-Marie|last=Cojez|date=7 August 2009|work=encyclopedie.picardie.fr|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref>

In 1875, he delivered before the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Arts of Amiens a speech entitled "An ideal city: Amiens in the year 2000" where he portrays himself wandering in a forward-thinking city of Amiens. Since then, the city has built a tourist route from this text.

He died in Amiens in 1905, and he deeply marked the town's footprint, so that today many places, monuments and events bear his name. He rests at {{Interlanguage link|fr|Cimetière de La Madeleine (Amiens)|Cimetière de La Madeleine (Amiens)|La Madeleine cemetery}} where one can read on his tomb: ''Vers l'immortalité et l’éternelle jeunesse.'' [Towards immortality and eternal youth].

{{pull quote|Such as it is with his distinctive smile, how much I love the Golden Virgin, with her smile of heavenly hostess; how much I love its home at the door of the Cathedral in its adornment exquisite and simple of hawthorns.|author =[[Marcel Proust]] (about the portal of the Virgin Golden of the Cathedral of Amiens)}}

In 1885, Englishman [[John Ruskin]] published the Bible of Amiens, which was translated into French, extensively annotated and prefaced, in 1904, by Marcel Proust. This book dedicated to [[Amiens Cathedral|Notre-Dame d'Amiens]] was the opportunity for Proust to recall his admiration for the English author and the Cathedral of Amiens.

{{pull quote|I would like to give the reader the desire and the means to spend a day at Amiens in a sort of Ruskinesque pilgrimage. It was not worth starting by asking him to go to Florence or Venice, when Ruskin wrote a whole book on Amiens.|author =Marcel Proust}}

In the second half of the 19th century, {{Interlanguage link|fr|Jules Barni}}, {{Interlanguage link|fr|List of députés of the Somme|Liste des députés de la Somme|Member of Parliament for the Somme}}, Associate Professor of philosophy and brilliant scholar translated Kant's work in French and thus enabled its dissemination in France.

A native of Amiens, [[Paul Bourget]] published {{interlanguage link|fr|Le Disciple|Le Disciple|''Le Disciple''}} in 1889, novel today considered his major work. He was elected, 5 years later, to the Académie française.

Born in Sainte-Anne district in 1885, [[Roland Dorgelès]] published {{interlanguage link|fr|Les Croix de bois|Les Croix de bois|''Les Croix de bois''}} in 1919. A masterpiece written from his notes taken at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Front]], the novel won the [[Prix Femina]] the same year. Though capable of obtaining the [[Prix Goncourt]], it was beaten by {{Interlanguage link|fr|À l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs}} of Marcel Proust, 6 votes against 4. A member of the [[Académie Goncourt]] in 1929, he was elected president in 1954 until his death in 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.editionstrotteuraile.fr/Roland-Dorgeles_a37.html |title=Roland Dorgeles|first=Jean-Louis|last=Andreani|publisher= Les éditions du trotteur ailé|accessdate=16 March 2013}}</ref>

In 1926, the Amiens native [[Henri Deberly]], won the Prix Goncourt with {{Interlanguage link|fr|Le Supplice de Phèdre}}, a novel inspired by his home city.

*The ''blasons populaires'' are surnames or the nicknames given to the inhabitants of cities and the Picardy villages. These ''surpitchets'' sometimes come from the history of the city, sometimes a verbal game, sometimes through a mockery of people. The nickname of the inhabitants of Amiens is: ''Chés Maqueus d'gueugues d'Anmien'' [Amiens nut eaters] in reference to an episode of the Spanish invasion. On 11 March 1597, the Spanish armies developed a ploy to seize the city: The soldiers of Hernán Tello de Portocarrero, Governor of [[Doullens]], disguised as peasants, came to the gates of the walls with nuts. The Amiens hungry then opened the doors and the Spaniards took the city.

;Logo of the city of Amiens
In 1991, the municipality formed around [[Gilles de Robien]] designed a new logo, incorporating the Fleur-de-lis and the Ivy leaf present on the coat of arms, placed side by side in red with a background of grey or white, depending on usage.

*A [[Postage stamp|stamp]] representing the arms of the city was issued in 1962, this issue fitted into one of the ''Arms of cities''. Its power of postage was five cents. It was issued on 23 January 1962 and withdrawn from sale on 23 January 1977. A ''first day'' was arranged in Amiens on 21 July 1962. It was designed by {{Interlanguage link|fr|Robert Louis (architect)|Robert Louis|Robert Louis}}. Artist [[Arman]] made a board collage of this stamp.<ref>Œuvre listed under the No. APA #8005.62.010 Arman archives in New York.</ref>
