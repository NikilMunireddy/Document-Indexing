The '''Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film''' is one of the [[Academy Award|Academy Awards of Merit]], or Oscars, handed out annually by the U.S.-based [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS). It is given to a [[feature-length]] motion picture produced outside the United States of America with a predominantly non-English dialogue track.<ref name="Rules">[http://www.oscars.org/80academyawards/rules/rule14.html 80th Academy Awards – Special Rules for the Best Foreign Language Film Award].

When the first Academy Awards ceremony was held on May 16, 1929, to honor films released in 1927[[1928 in film|/28]], there was no separate category for foreign language films. Between [[20th Academy Awards|1947]] and [[28th Academy Awards|1955]], the Academy presented [[Academy Honorary Award|Special/Honorary Awards]] to the best foreign language films released in the United States. These Awards, however, were not handed out on a regular basis (no Award was given in [[26th Academy Awards|1953]]), and were not competitive since there were no nominees but simply one winning film per year. For the [[29th Academy Awards|1956 (29th) Academy Awards]], a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since then.

Unlike other Academy Awards, the Best Foreign Language Film Award is not presented to a specific individual. It is accepted by the winning film's director, but is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. Over the years, the Best Foreign Language Film Award and its predecessors have been given almost exclusively to European films: out of the 68 Awards handed out by the Academy since [[20th Academy Awards|1947]] to foreign language films, fifty-six have gone to [[European cinema|European films]],<ref>[[European cinema|Europe]]'s tally includes 14 nominations and 4 wins for the [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|U.S.S.R.]] and its [[Post-Soviet states|successor states]]. It also includes 5 [[Academy Honorary Award|Special/Honorary Awards]]: 2 won by [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]], 2 won by [[Cinema of France|France]] and 1 shared between them for ''[[The Walls of Malapaga]]'' (1949). The latter Award is counted only once in Europe's tally, whereas it is included twice in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film#Awards tally by country|country-based table]] as it figures in both [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]]'s and [[Cinema of France|France]]'s tallies.</ref> six to [[Asian cinema|Asian films]],<ref>Number includes 3 [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Awards]] for [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]].</ref> three to [[African cinema|African films]] and three to [[Cinema of the Americas|films from the Americas]]. [[Italians|Italian]] filmmaker [[Federico Fellini]] directed four Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award–winning motion pictures during his lifetime, a record that remains unmatched as of 2007 (if [[Academy Honorary Award|Special Awards]] are taken into account, then Fellini's record is tied by his fellow countryman [[Vittorio De Sica]]).
The most awarded foreign country is [[Italy]], with 14 awards won, 3 [[Academy Honorary Award|Special Awards]] and 31 nominations, while France being the foreign country with the largest number of nominations (39 for 12 win) and Israel being the foreign country with the largest number of nominations, 10, without winning an award. Portugal has the largest number of submissions (30) without a nomination.

==History==
When the [[1st Academy Awards|first Academy Awards]] ceremony was held in 1929, no foreign language film was honored. During the early post-war era (1947–1955), eight foreign language films received [[Academy Honorary Award|Special or Honorary Awards]]. Academy leader and board member [[Jean Hersholt]] argued that "an international award, if properly and carefully administered, would promote a closer relationship between American film craftsmen and those of other countries." The first foreign language film honored with such an award was the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealist]] drama ''[[Shoeshine (film)|Shoeshine]]'', whose citation read: "the high quality of this motion picture, brought to eloquent life in a [[Military history of Italy during World War II|country scarred by war]], is proof to the world that the creative spirit can triumph over adversity." In the following years, similar awards were given to seven other films: one from Italy (''[[Bicycle Thieves|The Bicycle Thief]]''), two from France (''[[Monsieur Vincent]]'' and ''[[Forbidden Games]]''), three from Japan (''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'', ''[[Gate of Hell (film)|Gate of Hell]]'' and ''[[Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto|Samurai, The Legend of Musashi]]''), as well as a Franco-Italian [[International co-production|co-production]] (''[[The Walls of Malapaga]]''). These awards, however, were handed out on a discretionary rather than a regular basis (no award was given at the [[26th Academy Awards]] held in 1954), and were not competitive since there were no nominees but simply one winning film per year.<ref name="Levy">{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Emanuel |authorlink=Emanuel Levy |title=All About Oscar: The History and Politics of the Academy Awards |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dH2Lb_YhIhAC&pg=PA207 |accessdate=2010-07-16 |edition=2nd |year=2003 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8264-1452-6 |page=207 |chapter=Chapter 11: The Oscar and the Foreign-Language Picture}}</ref>

A separate category for non-English-language films was created in 1956. Known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, it has been awarded every year since then.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pryor |first=Thomas M. |date=October 2, 1956 |title='Oscar' Created For Foreign Films |journal=[[The New York Times]] |page=39 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40C12FB3A591B7B93C0A9178BD95F428585F9 |format=fee required |accessdate=2010-07-16}}</ref> The first recipient was the Italian neorealist drama ''[[La strada|La Strada]]'', which helped establish [[Federico Fellini]] as one of the most important European directors.<ref name="Levy"/>

== Eligibility ==

Unlike other Academy Awards, the Foreign Language Film Award does not require films to be released in the United States in order to be eligible for competition. Films competing in the Foreign Language Film category must have been first released in the country submitting them during the eligibility period defined by the rules of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]], and must have been exhibited for at least seven consecutive days in a commercial movie theater.<ref name="Rules"/> The eligibility period for the Foreign Language Film category differs from that required for most other categories: the awards year defined for the Foreign Language Film category usually begins and ends before the ordinary awards year, which corresponds to an exact [[calendar year]]. For the [[80th Academy Awards]], for instance, the release deadline for the Foreign Language Film category was set on September 30, 2007, whereas the qualifying run for most other categories extended till December 31, 2007.<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/80academyawards/rules/rule03.html 80th Academy Awards – The Awards Year and Deadlines]. [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]. Retrieved November 2, 2007.</ref>

Although the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film is commonly referred to simply as the Foreign Film Oscar in newspaper articles and on the Internet,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4286446.stm "Countries choose Oscar contenders"], [[BBC News]], 2005-09-27. Retrieved November 19, 2007.</ref> such a designation is misleading, since a film's nationality matters much less than its language. Although a film has to be "foreign" (i.e. non-[[Cinema of the United States|American]]) in order to be nominated for the Award, it also has to be in a language other than English. Foreign films where the majority of the dialogue is in English cannot qualify for the Foreign Language Film Award, and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] has usually applied this requirement very seriously by disqualifying films containing too much English dialogue, the most recent case being that of the [[Cinema of Israel|Israeli]] film ''[[The Band's Visit]]'' (2007).<ref>[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1191257285672 "''The Band's Visit'' dropped from Oscar race"], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 2007-10-11. Retrieved November 2, 2007.</ref> Despite the basic importance of the foreign language requirement, a completely dialogueless film such as ''[[Le Bal (1983 film)|Le Bal]]'' (1983) was nominated in the Foreign Language Film category.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085213/ ''Le Bal''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]. Retrieved December 3, 2007.</ref>

Another disqualifying factor is a film's television or Internet transmission prior to its theatrical release, hence the Academy's rejection of the [[Cinema of the Netherlands|Dutch]] film ''[[Bluebird (2004 film)|Bluebird]]'' (2004).<ref>Dore, Shalini. [http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117934502.html?categoryid=19&cs=1 "Academy grounds Holland's ''Bluebird''"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 2005-12-12. Retrieved November 2, 2007.</ref> A film may also be refused if its submitting country has exercised insufficient artistic control over it. Several films have been declared ineligible by the Academy for the latter reason, the most recent of which is ''[[Lust, Caution]]'' (2007), [[Cinema of Taiwan|Taiwan]]'s entry for the [[80th Academy Awards]].<ref>Dore, Shalini. [http://www.varietyasiaonline.com/content/view/4715/53/ "Academy rejects ''Lust Caution'' as Taiwan Oscar entry"], ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 2007-10-18. Retrieved November 5, 2007.</ref> The disqualifications, however, generally take place in the pre-nomination stage, with the exception of ''[[A Place in the World (film)|A Place in the World]]'' (1992), [[List of Uruguayan films|Uruguay]]'s entry for the [[65th Academy Awards]], which was disqualified because of insufficient Uruguayan artistic control ''after'' having secured a nomination. It is the only film so far to have been declared ineligible and removed from the final ballot after having been nominated for the Foreign Language Film Award.

Since the [[79th Academy Awards|2006 (79th) Academy Awards]], submitted films no longer have to be in an official language of the submitting country.<ref name="Rule Changes"/> This requirement had previously prevented countries from submitting films where the majority of the dialogue was spoken in a language that was non-native to the submitting country, and the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]]'s executive director explicitly cited as a reason for the rule change the case of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] film ''[[Private (film)|Private]]'' (2004), which was disqualified simply because its main spoken languages were [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], neither of which are [[List of languages of Italy|indigenous languages of Italy]].<ref>[http://www.jerusalem-times.net/article/news/details/detail.asp?id=4143&edition=595 "More Academy Resistance to Films from or About Palestine"], ''[[The Jerusalem Times]]'', 2005-10-26. Retrieved November 2, 2007.</ref> This rule change enabled a country like [[Cinema of Canada|Canada]] to receive a nomination for a Hindi-language film, ''[[Water (2005 film)|Water]]''. Previously, Canada had been nominated for [[French-language]] films only, since films shot in Canada's other official language (English) were ineligible for consideration for the Foreign Language Film category. Before the rule change, Canada submitted one film in a different language—''[[Atanarjuat]]'' (2001), shot in [[Inuktitut]]. That language, one of the country's [[Languages of Canada#Aboriginal languages|aboriginal languages]], is not official throughout Canada, but was (and still is) official in [[Nunavut]] and the [[Northwest Territories]]. ''Atanarjuat'' did not earn a nomination. The rule change, however, did not affect the eligibility of non-English speaking [[Cinema of the United States|American films]], which are still disqualified from the Foreign Language Film category due to their nationality. Because of this, a [[Japanese-language]] film like ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'' (2006) or a [[Yucatec Maya language|Mayan-language]] film like ''[[Apocalypto]]'' (2006) were unable to compete for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, even though they were both nominated for (and, in the case of ''[[Letters from Iwo Jima]]'', won) the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], which does not have similar nationality restrictions.<ref>Kilday, Gregg.

Retrieved November 9, 2007.</ref> The nationality restrictions also differ from the practice of the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA) for their analogous award for [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language|Best Film Not in the English Language]]. While BAFTA Award eligibility requires a commercial release in the United Kingdom, that body does not impose a nationality restriction.<ref name=BAFTA>{{cite web|url=http://awards.bafta.org/sites/default/files/images/film_1516_rules_and_guidelines_final_3.pdf |title=EE British Academy Film Awards: Rules and Guidelines 2015/16 |publisher=British Academy of Film and Television Arts|accessdate=8 March 2016}}</ref>

As known, all films produced inside the United States have been ineligible for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film regardless of the language of their dialogue track.  This fact also included films produced in [[U.S. overseas possessions]].  However, [[Puerto Rico]] is an [[unincorporated territory]] of the United States and used to be eligible due to [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Ricans]] having had [[Jones-Shafroth Act|American citizenship since 1917]].  Their best success in this award was receiving a nomination for ''[[Lo que le Pasó a Santiago|Santiago, the Story of his New Life]]'' (1989). However, as of 2011, the Academy had decided not to allow submissions from the territory anymore.<ref>[http://www.elnuevodia.com/puertoricoquedaexcluidodelacarreraporeloscar-1085149.html Puerto Rico queda excluido de la carrera por el Oscar]; ''[[El Nuevo Día]]'' (October 5, 2011)</ref>

== Submission and nomination process ==
{{Further2|[[:Category:Submissions for Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award]]}}
Every country is invited to submit what it considers its best film to the Academy. The designation of each country's official submission has to be done by an organization, jury or committee composed of people from the [[film industry]], whose members' names must be sent to the Academy. Only one film is accepted from each country.

After each country has designated its official entry, English-[[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]] copies of all submitted films are shipped to the Academy, where they are screened by the Foreign Language Film Award Committee(s), whose members select by [[secret ballot]] the five official nominations. Final voting for the winner is restricted to active and life Academy members who have attended exhibitions of all five nominated films. Members who have watched the Foreign Language Film entries only on [[videocassette]] or DVD are ineligible to vote.<ref name="Rules"/> These procedures were slightly modified for the [[79th Academy Awards|2006 (79th) Academy Awards]], with the Academy deciding to institute a two-stage process in determining the nominees: for the first time in the history of the award, a nine-film shortlist was published one week before the official nominations announcement.<ref>Zeitchik, Steven.

Retrieved November 2, 2007.</ref> In the meantime, a smaller thirty-member committee which included ten New York-based Academy members was formed, and spent three days viewing the shortlisted films before choosing the five official nominees.

== Recipient ==
{{Main|List of Academy Award winners and nominees for Best Foreign Language Film}}
Unlike the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], which officially goes to the winning film's producers, the Foreign Language Film Award is not given to a specific individual but is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. For example, the Oscar statuette won by the [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian]] film ''[[The Barbarian Invasions]]'' (2003) was until recently on display at the [[Musée de la civilisation|Museum of Civilization]] in [[Quebec City]].<ref>[http://www.mcq.org/en/mcq/expositions.php?idEx=w289 ''Québec Cinema: The Whole Story'' – A major exhibition on Québec film]. [[Musée de la civilisation]], 2006-05-03. Retrieved November 2, 2007.</ref> It is now on display at the TIFF Bell lightbox.

The rules currently governing the Foreign Language Film category state that "the Academy statuette (Oscar) will be awarded to the picture and ''accepted'' by the director on behalf of the film's creative talents" (emphasis added).<ref name="Rules"/> Therefore, the director does not ''personally'' win the Award, but simply accepts it during the [[List of Academy Awards ceremonies|ceremony]]. In fact, the Foreign Language Film Award has never been associated with a specific individual since its creation, except for the [[29th Academy Awards|1956 (29th) Academy Awards]], when the names of the producers were included in the nomination for the Foreign Language Film category. A director like [[Federico Fellini]] is thus considered to have never officially won an Academy Award of Merit during his lifetime, even though four of his films received the Foreign Language Film Award (the only Academy Award that Fellini personally won was his [[65th Academy Awards|1992]] [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Award]]). On the other hand, producers [[Dino De Laurentiis]] and [[Carlo Ponti]] are considered to have personally won the [[29th Academy Awards|1956]] Foreign Language Film Award given to Fellini's ''[[La strada (film)|La Strada]]'' (1954), since their names were explicitly included in the nomination.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

By contrast, the BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language is personally awarded to the director and producer—that award's rules specifically state that the nomination and award is presented to the director and/or if "a producer equally shared the creative input with the director, both names may be submitted.  A  maximum of two individuals will be nominated per film."<ref name=BAFTA/>

In 2014 it was announced that the name of the director will be engraved onto the Oscar statuette, in addition to the name of the country.<ref name="Director">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewrap.com/oscars-to-add-winning-foreign-language-directors-name-on-statuette/ |title=Oscars to Add Winning Foreign Language Director's Name on Statuette |accessdate=18 September 2014 |work=The Wrap}}</ref>

== Criticisms and controversies ==
Because each country chooses its official submission according to its own rules, the decisions of the nominating bodies in each respective country are sometimes mired in controversy: for instance, the Indian selection committee ([[Film Federation of India]]) was accused of bias by [[Bhavna Talwar]], the director of ''[[Dharm (film)|Dharm]]'' (2007), who claimed her film was rejected in favor of ''[[Eklavya: The Royal Guard]]'' (2007) because of the personal connections of the latter film's director and producer.<ref>[http://in.reuters.com/article/hollywood/idINDEL9964020070929 "India's entry to Oscars caught in a legal tangle"], [[Reuters|Reuters India]], 2007-09-29. Retrieved November 14, 2007.</ref>

In recent years, the Academy's very definition of the term "country" itself has been polemical. The submissions for the 75th Academy Awards, for instance, became shrouded in controversy when it was reported that [[Humbert Balsan]], producer of the critically acclaimed [[Palestinian cinema|Palestinian]] film ''[[Divine Intervention (film)|Divine Intervention]]'' (2002), tried to submit his picture to the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|Academy]] but was told it could not run for the Foreign Language Film Award since the [[State of Palestine]] is not recognized by the Academy in its rules. Because the Academy had previously accepted films from other political entities such as [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], the rejection of ''Divine Intervention'' triggered accusations of [[double standard]] from pro-Palestinian activists.<ref>Doherty & Abunimah. [http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article962.shtml "Oscars' double standard turns Palestinian film into refugee"], ''[[Electronic Intifada|The Electronic Intifada]]'', 2002-12-10. Retrieved November 20, 2007.</ref> Three years later, however, another Palestinian-Arab film, ''[[Paradise Now]]'' (2005), succeeded in getting nominated for the Foreign Language Film Award. The nomination also caused protests, this time from [[Israel lobby in the United States|pro-Israeli groups in the United States]], who objected to the Academy's use of the name "Palestine" on its official website to designate the film's submitting country.<ref>[http://www.oscars.org/78academyawards/nomswins.html 78th Academy Awards – Nominees and Winners]. [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]. Retrieved November 20, 2007.</ref> After intense lobbying from Jewish groups, the Academy decided to designate ''Paradise Now'' as a submission from the [[Palestinian Authority]], a move that was decried by the film's director [[Hany Abu-Assad]].<ref>Agassi, Tirzah. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/02/26/ING5RHDJ451.DTL "Middle East tensions hang over Palestinian nominee for an Oscar"], ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 2006-02-26. Retrieved November 20, 2007.</ref> During the [[78th Academy Awards|awards ceremony]], the film was eventually announced by presenter [[Will Smith]] as a submission from the [[Palestinian Territories]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Another object of controversy is the Academy's "one-country-one-film" rule, which has been criticized by filmmakers.<ref>Galloway, Stephen.
