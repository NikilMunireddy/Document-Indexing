The '''Hewlett-Packard Company''' (commonly referred to as '''HP''') was an American [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[information technology|information]] [[technology company]]  headquartered in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[California]]. It developed and provided a wide variety of hardware components as well as software and related services to consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses ([[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMBs]]) and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.

The company was founded in a [[HP Garage|one-car garage]] in Palo Alto by [[William Redington Hewlett|William "Bill" Redington Hewlett]] and [[David Packard|David "Dave" Packard]], and initially produced a line of electronic test equipment. HP was the world's [[Market share of personal computer vendors|leading PC manufacturer]] from 2007 to Q2 2013, after which [[Lenovo]] remained ranked ahead of HP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/379297/hp-regains-pc-lead-over-lenovo |title=HP regains PC lead over Lenovo |publisher=PC Pro |date=January 14, 2013 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmontlake/2013/07/11/lenovo-shares-jump-as-pc-shipments-overtake-hp/ Lenovo Shares Jump As PC Shipments Overtake HP].

Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. HP marketed its products to households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises directly as well as via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors. HP also had services and consulting business around its products and partner products.

Hewlett-Packard company events included the [[Corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of its electronic and bio-analytical measurement instruments part of its business as [[Agilent Technologies]] in 1999, its [[merger]] with [[Compaq]] in 2002, and the acquisition of [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] in 2008, which led to combined revenues of $118.4&nbsp;billion in 2008 and a [[Fortune 500]] ranking of 9 in 2009.

On October 6, 2014, Hewlett-Packard announced plans to split the PC and printers business from its enterprise products and services business. The split closed on November 1, 2015, and resulted in two publicly traded companies: [[HP Inc.]] and [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2014/10/06/us-hp-restructuring-idINKCN0HV0U720141006 |title=Hewlett-Packard to split into two public companies |date=October 6, 2014 |agency=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref>

The company originated in a [[HP Garage|garage]] in nearby [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] during a fellowship they had with a past professor, [[Frederick Terman]] at Stanford during the [[Great Depression]]. Terman was considered a mentor to them in forming Hewlett-Packard.<ref name="isbn1-59184-152-6">{{cite book|author=Malone, Michael |title=Bill & Dave: How Hewlett and Packard Built the World's Greatest Company |publisher=Portfolio Hardcover |year=2007 |pages=39–41 |isbn=1-59184-152-6 |oclc= }}</ref> In 1939, Packard and Hewlett established Hewlett-Packard (HP) in Packard's garage with an initial capital investment of US$538.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/garage/ |title=HP History: HP's Garage |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |date=December 6, 2005 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> Hewlett and Packard tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett-Packard or Packard-Hewlett.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/timeline/ |title=HP Company Information. HP Interactive Timeline |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> HP incorporated on August 18, 1947, and went public on November 6, 1957.

Of the many projects they worked on, their very first financially successful product was a precision audio [[electronic oscillator|oscillator]], the Model [[HP200A]]. Their innovation was the use of a small incandescent [[light bulb]] (known as a "pilot light") as a temperature dependent [[resistor]] in a critical portion of the circuit, the negative feedback loop which stabilized the amplitude of the output sinusoidal waveform. This allowed them to sell the Model 200A for $54.40 when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over $200. The Model 200 series of generators continued until at least 1972 as the 200AB, still tube-based but improved in design through the years.

One of the company's earliest customers was [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] which bought eight Model 200B [[oscillators]] (at $71.50 each) for use in certifying the [[Fantasound]] [[surround sound]] systems installed in theaters for the movie ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.

They worked on counter-radar technology and artillery shell fuses during World War II, which allowed Packard (but not Hewlett) to be exempt from the draft.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Hewlett-Packard Company |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Britannica]] |accessdate=October 10, 2014 |author=Mark Hall}}</ref>

===1960s===
HP is recognized as the symbolic founder of [[Silicon Valley]], although it did not actively investigate semiconductor devices until a few years after the "[[traitorous eight]]" had abandoned [[William Shockley]] to create [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in 1957. Hewlett-Packard's HP Associates division, established around 1960, developed semiconductor devices primarily for internal use. Instruments and calculators were some of the products using these devices.

HP partnered in the 1960s with Sony and the [[Yokogawa Electric]] companies in Japan to develop several high-quality products. The products were not a huge success, as there were high costs in building HP-looking products in Japan. HP and Yokogawa formed a joint venture (Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard) in 1963 to market HP products in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/timeline/hist_60s.html |title=HP History : 1960s |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |date=March 17, 1961 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> HP bought Yokogawa Electric's share of Hewlett-Packard Japan in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yokogawa Electric Corporation |url=http://www.yokogawa.com/pr/Corporate/News/1999/pr-news-1999-03-en.htm |title=Yokogawa Electric Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company Announce "Hewlett-Packard Japan to become Wholly Owned HP Subsidiary" HP and Yokogawa Sign Agreement |publisher=Yokogawa.com |date=July 7, 1999 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref>

HP spun off a small company, Dynac, to specialize in digital equipment. The name was picked so that the HP logo "hp" could be turned upside down to be a reverse reflect image of the logo "dy" of the new company. Eventually Dynac changed to Dymec, then was folded back into HP in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/earlyinstruments/0006/index.html |title=Dynac DY-2500 at HP Virtual Museum |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> HP experimented with using [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) minicomputers with its instruments, but after deciding that it would be easier to build another small design team than deal with DEC, HP entered the computer market in 1966 with the [[HP 2100]] / [[HP 1000]] series of minicomputers. These had a simple [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]-based design, with registers arranged somewhat similarly to the [[Intel x86]] architecture still used today. The series was produced for 20 years, in spite of several attempts to replace it, and was a forerunner of the [[HP 9830|HP 9800]] and [[HP 250]] series of desktop and business computers.

===1970s===
[[File:HP-1974-logo.svg|thumb|220px|Hewlett-Packard logo used from 1964 to 1979]]
The [[HP 3000]] was an advanced stack-based design for a business computing server, later redesigned with [[RISC]] technology. The [[HP 2640]] series of smart and intelligent terminals introduced forms-based interfaces to [[ASCII]] terminals, and also introduced [[screen labeled function keys]], now commonly used on gas pumps and bank ATMs. The [[HP 2640]] series included one of the first bit mapped graphics displays that when combined with the [[HP 2100]] 21MX F-Series microcoded Scientific Instruction Set<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.net/exhibit.php?hwdoc=110 |title=HP1000 F-Series |publisher=HP Museum |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> enabled the first commercial [[WYSIWYG]] [[Presentation Program]], [[BRUNO]] that later became the program HP-Draw on the [[HP 3000]]. Although scoffed at in the formative days of computing, HP would eventually surpass even IBM as the world's largest technology vendor, in terms of sales.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2009/full_list/ |title=Global 500 2009: Global 500 1-100 – FORTUNE on CNNMoney.com |publisher=CNN |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:HP0100A 1.jpg|thumb|left|"The new [[Hewlett-Packard 9100A]] personal computer is ready, willing, and able ... to relieve you of waiting to get on the big computer."]]
Although [[Programma 101]] was the first commercial "[[desktop computer]]", HP is identified by ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'' magazine as the producer of the world's first device to be called a personal computer, the [[Hewlett-Packard 9100A]], introduced in 1968.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.12/mustread.html |title=Wired 8.12 |work=Wired |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> HP called it a desktop calculator, because, as Bill Hewlett said, "If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers' computer gurus because it didn't look like an [[IBM mainframe|IBM]]. We therefore decided to call it a calculator, and all such nonsense disappeared." An engineering triumph at the time, the logic circuit was produced without any [[integrated circuits]]; the assembly of the CPU having been entirely executed in discrete components. With [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] display, magnetic-card storage, and printer, the price was around $5,000. The machine's keyboard was a cross between that of a scientific calculator and an adding machine. There was no alphabetic keyboard.

[[Steve Wozniak]], co-founder of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], originally designed the [[Apple I]] computer while working at HP and offered it to them under their [[right of first refusal]] to his work, but they did not take it up as the company wanted to stay in scientific, business, and industrial markets. Wozniak said that HP "turned him down 5 times." Wozniak said his loyalty to HP made him hesitant to start Apple with Steve Jobs.<ref name="AI">{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/06/apple_co_founder_offered_first_computer_design_to_hp_5_times |title=Apple co-founder offered first computer design to HP 5 times |publisher=appleinsider.com}}</ref>

The company earned global respect for a variety of products. They introduced the world's first ''handheld scientific electronic [[calculator]]'' in 1972 (the [[HP-35]]), the first ''handheld programmable'' in 1974 (the [[HP-65]]), the first ''alphanumeric, programmable, expandable'' in 1979 (the [[HP-41]]C), and the first symbolic and graphing calculator, the [[HP-28C]]. Like their scientific and business calculators, their [[oscilloscope]]s, [[logic analyzer]]s, and other measurement instruments have a reputation for sturdiness and usability (the latter products are now part of spin-off [[Agilent Technologies|Agilent]]'s product line). The company's design philosophy in this period was summarized as "design for the guy at the next bench".{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The [[HP 9800 series|98x5]] series of technical desktop computers started in 1975 with the 9815, and the cheaper 80 series, again of technical computers, started in 1979 with the 85.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpmuseum.net/exhibit.php?class=1&cat=9 |title=HP Computer Museum |publisher=HP Museum |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>  These machines used a version of the [[BASIC programming language]] which was available immediately after they were switched on, and used a proprietary magnetic tape for storage. HP computers were similar in capabilities to the much later [[IBM Personal Computer]], although the limitations of available technology forced prices to be high.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===1980s===
In 1984, HP introduced both [[inkjet printer|inkjet]] and [[laser printer]]s for the desktop. Along with its [[image scanner|scanner]] product line, these have later been developed into successful [[multifunctional|multifunction]] products, the most significant being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The print mechanisms in HP's tremendously popular [[HP LaserJet|LaserJet]] line of laser printers depend almost entirely on [[Canon Inc.]]'s components (print engines), which in turn use technology developed by [[Xerox]]. HP develops the hardware, firmware, and software that convert data into dots for the mechanism to print.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  HP transitioned from the [[HP3000]] to the [[HP9000]] series minicomputers with attached storage such as the [[HP 7935]] hard drive holding 404 MiB.

On March 3, 1986, HP registered the HP.com domain name, making it the [[List of the oldest currently-registered Internet domain names|ninth Internet]] [[.com]] domain ever to be registered.

In 1987, the [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business was designated as a California State historical landmark.

===1990s===
[[File:Hewlett-Packard logo.svg|thumb|150px|Hewlett-Packard logo used from 1979 to 2010]]
In the 1990s, HP expanded their computer product line, which initially had been targeted at university, research, and business users, to reach consumers. HP also grew through acquisitions. It bought [[Apollo Computer]] in 1989 and [[Convex Computer]] in 1995.

Later in the decade, HP opened hpshopping.com as an independent subsidiary to sell online, direct to consumers; in 2005, the store was renamed "HP Home & Home Office Store."

From 1995 to 1998, Hewlett-Packard were sponsors of the English football team [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]].

In 1999, all of the businesses not related to computers, storage, and imaging were spun off from HP to form [[Agilent]] Technologies. Agilent's spin-off was the largest [[initial public offering]] in the history of [[Silicon Valley]].<ref>Arensman, Russ. "Unfinished business: managing one of the biggest spin-offs in corporate history would be a challenge even in the best of times. But what Agilent's Ned Barnholt got was the worst of times. (Cover Story)." Electronic Business 28.10 (October 2002): 36(6).</ref> The spin-off created an $8&nbsp;billion company with about 30,000 employees, manufacturing [[Measuring instrument|scientific instruments]], [[semiconductor]]s, optical networking devices, and [[electronic test equipment]] for [[Telecommunications|telecom]] and wireless [[research and development|R&D]] and production.

In July 1999, HP appointed [[Carly Fiorina]] as [[CEO]], the first female CEO of a company in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]]. Fiorina served as CEO during the technology downturn{{fact|date=January 2016}} of the early 2000s. During her tenure, the market value of HP halved and the company cut jobs heavily.<ref>HP's share price moved from 45.36 to 20.14 during Fiorina's leadership, a performance of −56% (share price data from Bloomberg); the market as a whole, as measured by the benchmark [http://www.djindexes.com/mdsidx/index.cfm?event=showtotalMarketIndexData&perf=Historical%20Values Dow Jones U.S. Large Cap Technology Index], fell by 51% between July 19, 1999 and February 9, 2005.</ref> The HP Board of Directors asked Fiorina to step down in 2005, and she resigned on February 9, 2005.

On September 3, 2001, HP announced that an agreement had been reached with [[Compaq]] to merge the two companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2001/010904a.html |title=HP Press Release: Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Agree to Merge, Creating $87&nbsp;billion Global Technology Leader |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref> In May 2002, after passing a shareholder vote, HP officially merged with Compaq. Prior to this, plans had been in place to consolidate the companies' product teams and product lines.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2002/020503a.html |title=HP Closes Compaq Merger |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>

Compaq had already taken over [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in 1998. HP therefore still offers support for the former Digital Equipment products PDP-11, VAX and AlphaServer.

The merger occurred after a proxy fight with Bill Hewlett's son Walter, who objected to the merger. Compaq itself had bought [[Tandem Computers]] in 1997 (which had been started by ex-HP employees), and Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998. Following this strategy, HP became a major player in [[desktop computer|desktops]], laptops, and servers for many different markets. After the merger with Compaq, the new [[ticker symbol]] became "HPQ", a combination of the two previous symbols, "HWP" and "CPQ", to show the significance of the alliance and also key letters from the two companies '''H'''ewlett-'''P'''ackard and Compa'''q''' (the latter company being famous for its "Q" logo on all of its products).

In 2004, HP released the DV 1000 Series, including the [[HP Pavilion dv 1658]] and 1040 two years later in May 2006, HP began its campaign, "The Computer is Personal Again". The campaign was designed to bring back the fact that the [[Personal computer|PC]] is a personal product. The campaign utilized viral marketing, sophisticated visuals and its own website (www.hp.com/personal). Some of the ads featured [[Pharrell]], [[Petra Nemcova]], [[Mark Burnett]], [[Mark Cuban]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Gwen Stefani]], and [[Shaun White]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

On May 13, 2008, HP and [[Electronic Data Systems]] (EDS) announced<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2008/080513a.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN |title=press release |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> that they had signed a definitive agreement under which HP would purchase EDS. On June 30, HP announced<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2008/080630a.html?jumpid=reg_R1002_USEN |title=HP Announces Expiration of Waiting Period Under HSR Act |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> that the waiting period under the [[Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act]] of 1976 had expired. "The transaction still requires EDS stockholder approval and regulatory clearance from the European Commission and other non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in the merger agreement."  The agreement was finalized on August 26, 2008 at $13 billion, and it was publicly announced that EDS would be re-branded "EDS a HP company."  The first targeted layoff of 24,600 former EDS workers was announced on September 15, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2008/080915a.html |title=HP Announces Plans to Integrate EDS |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref> (The company's 2008 Annual Report gave the number as 24,700, to be completed by end of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/irol/71/71087/AR2008/HTML2/hewlett-packard-ar2008_0119.htm |title=Annual Report 2008 |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |page=131 |accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref>) This round was factored into purchase price as a $1.5 billion liability against goodwill.  As of September 23, 2009, EDS is known as [[HP Enterprise Services]].

On November 11, 2009, [[3Com]] and Hewlett-Packard announced that Hewlett-Packard would be acquiring 3Com for $2.7&nbsp;billion in cash.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/newsroom/press/2009/091111xa.html |title=HP to Acquire 3Com for $2.7&nbsp;billion |publisher=Hewlett-Packard |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref> The acquisition is one of the biggest in size among a series of takeovers and acquisitions by technology giants to push their way to become one-stop shops. Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, tech giants have constantly felt the pressure to expand beyond their current market niches. [[Dell]] purchased [[Perot Systems]] recently to invade into the technology consulting business area previously dominated by [[IBM]].

===Takeover of Autonomy===
{{see also|Autonomy Corporation#Hewlett Packard}}
In November 2012, HP recorded a writedown of around $8.8 billion related to its acquisition a year earlier of the UK based [[Autonomy Corporation]] [[Public limited company|PLC]]. HP accused Autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover. The former management team of Autonomy flatly rejected the charge.

Autonomy specialized in analysis of large scale unstructured "[[big data]]", and by 2010 was the UK's largest and most successful<ref name="telegraph19aug2011">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/8709821/Autonomy-board-backs-7bn-Hewlett-Packard-offer.html Autonomy board backs £7bn Hewlett-Packard offer], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', August 19, 2011</ref> [[software business]]. It maintained an aggressively [[entrepreneurial]] marketing approach, and controls described as a "rod of iron", which was said to include [[zero tolerance]] and firing the weakest 5% of its sales force each quarter, while cosetting the best sales staff "like rock stars".<ref name="telegraph25nov2012">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/9700557/Rage-of-the-Titans-Whitman-vs-Lynch.html Rage of the Titans: Whitman vs Lynch], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', November 25, 2012</ref>

At the time, HP had fired its previous CEO for expenses irregularities a year before, and appointed [[Léo Apotheker]] as CEO and President. HP was seen as problematic by the market, with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services. Apotheker's strategy was to aim at disposing of hardware and moving into the more profitable [[software]] [[Business service provider|services]] [[business sector|sector]].

As part of this strategy, Autonomy was acquired by HP in October 2011. HP paid $10.3 billion for 87.3% of the shares, valuing Autonomy at around $11.7 billion (£7.4 billion) overall, a [[Control premium|premium]] of around 79% over market price. The deal was widely criticized as "absurdly high", a "botched strategy shift" and a "chaotic" attempt to rapidly [[Turnaround management|reposition]] HP and enhance earnings,<ref name="bloomberg29nov2012"/><ref name="telegraph19aug2011" /><ref name="reuters3oct2011"/> and had been objected to even by HP's own [[CFO]].<ref name="telegraph25nov2012" /><ref name="hussainmotion11aug2014" />{{rp|3–6}} Within a year, Apotheker himself had been fired, major [[cultural conflict|culture clashes]] became apparent and HP had [[Write-off|written off]] $8.8 billion of Autonomy's value.<ref name="telegraph25nov2012" />

HP claim this resulted from "[[fraud|accounting improprieties]], [[misrepresentation]]s and disclosure failures" by the previous management, who in turn accuse HP of a "textbook example of [[gaming the system|defensive stalling]]"<ref name="hussainmotion11aug2014"/>{{rp|6}} to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross [[management|mismanagement]] and undermining of the company, noting public awareness since 2009 of its financial reporting issues<ref name="hussainmotion11aug2014" />{{rp|3}} and that even HP's [[CFO]] disagreed with the price paid.<ref name="telegraph25nov2012" /><ref name="hussainmotion11aug2014" />{{rp|3–6}} External observers generally state that only a small part of the write-off appears to be due to accounting mis-statements, and that HP had overpaid for businesses previously.<ref name="telegraph25nov2012" /><ref name="marketwatch19aug2014">[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-mysterious-case-of-hewlett-packards-autonomy-deal-2014-08-19 The mysterious case of Hewlett-Packard's Autonomy deal], ''[[Marketwatch]]'', August 19, 2014</ref>

The [[Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom)]], and the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] joined the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in investigating the potential anomalies.

In August 2014 a [[United States district court]] [[United States federal judge|judge]] threw out a proposed settlement, which Autonomy's previous management had argued would be [[collusive lawsuit|collusive]] and intended to divert scrutiny of HP's own responsibility and knowledge, by essentially engaging the plaintiff's attorneys from the existing cases and redirecting them against the previous Autonomy vendors and management, for a fee of up to $48 million, with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against HP's management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous Autonomy vendors and management.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/08/25/us-hp-autonomy-idUSKBN0GP1L420140825 |title=U.S. judge casts doubt on HP-shareholder settlement in Autonomy lawsuit |agency=Reuters |date=August 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/us-judge-rejects-settlement-deal-reached-in-hps-derivative-lawsuits-20140825-00874 |title=Latest News Headlines |publisher=NASDAQ.com}}</ref> In January 2015 the SFO closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-30883288 |title=Autonomy HP sale investigation by Serious Fraud Office closes |publisher=BBC News |date=January 19, 2015}}</ref> The dispute is still being litigated in the US, and is being investigated by the UK and Ireland [[Financial Reporting Council]].

===Bribery===
On April 9, 2014, an administrative proceeding before [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] was settled by HP consenting to an order acknowledging that HP had violated the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) when HP subsidiaries in Russia, Poland, and Mexico made improper payments to government officials to obtain or retain lucrative public contracts.<ref><[http://www.businessinsider.com/hp-pays-108m-to-settle-bribery-cases-2014-4 Business Insider]</ref>

The SEC's order finds that HP's subsidiary in Russia paid more than $2 million through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office. In Poland, HP's subsidiary provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than $600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency. And as part of its bid to win a software sale to Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, HP's subsidiary in Mexico paid more than $1 million in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and money was funneled to one of those officials.  HP agreed to pay $108 million to settle the SEC charges and a parallel criminal case.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370541453075 |title=SEC.gov - SEC Charges Hewlett-Packard With FCPA Violations |publisher=sec.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/hp-pays-108m-to-settle-bribery-cases-2014-4 |title=HP Pays $108M To Settle Bribery Cases |date=April 9, 2014 |work=Business Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2014/04/09/h-p-in-108m-settlement-with-doj-over-foreign-practices/ |title=H-P Pays $108M to DOJ, SEC Over Anti-Bribery Allegations |author=Jennifer Booton |work=Fox Business}}</ref>
