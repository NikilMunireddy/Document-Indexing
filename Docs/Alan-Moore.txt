'''Alan Moore''' (born 18 November 1953) is an English writer primarily known for his work in comic books including ''[[Watchmen]]'', ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' and ''[[From Hell]]''.<ref name="Alan Moore Bibliography">{{cite web | url=http://www.enjolrasworld.com/HTML%20Bibliographies/Alan%20Moore%20Bibliography.htm | title=Alan Moore Bibliography | work=Enjolrasworld.com | accessdate=13 June 2006| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqyn2B7h | archivedate = 17 January 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref> Frequently described as the best [[graphic novel]] writer in history,<ref name="Khoury, George">{{cite book | last=Khoury | first=George | authorlink=George Khoury (author) | title=The Extraordinary Works of Alan Moore | date=25 August 2003 | location=[[Raleigh, North Carolina]] | publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] | isbn=978-1-893905-24-5}}{{rp|page=10}}</ref><ref name="Parkin, Lance">{{cite book | last=Parkin | first=Lance | authorlink=Lance Parkin | title=Alan Moore: The Pocket Essential | date=January 2002 | location=[[Hertfordshire]], England | publisher=[[Trafalgar Square Publishing]] | isbn=978-1-903047-70-5}}{{rp|page=7}}</ref> he has been called "one of the most important British writers of the last fifty years".<ref name="Doyle-White, Ethan 2009">{{cite journal | last=Doyle-White | first=Ethan | date=Summer 2009 | title=Occultic World of Alan Moore | journal=[[Pentacle (magazine)|Pentacle]] | issue=29}}</ref> He has occasionally used such pseudonyms as '''Curt Vile''',  '''Jill de Ray''', '''Translucia Baboon''', and '''The Original Writer'''.

Moore started writing for British underground and alternative fanzines in the late 1970s before achieving success publishing comic strips in such magazines as ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' and ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]''. He was subsequently picked up by the American [[DC Comics]], and as "the first comics writer living in Britain to do prominent work in America",<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=7}} he worked on major characters such as [[Batman]] (''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'') and [[Superman]] (''[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]''), substantially developed the character [[Swamp Thing]], and penned original titles such as ''Watchmen''. During that decade, Moore helped to bring about greater social respectability for comics in the United States and United Kingdom.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=11}} He prefers the term "comic" to "graphic novel".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://blather.net/articles/amoore/northampton.html|title= The Alan Moore Interview|last= Kavanagh|first= Barry|publisher= Blather.net|date= 17 October 2000|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140226072653/http://www.blather.net/articles/amoore/northampton.html|archivedate= 26 February 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= 1 January 2013}} On the term "graphic novel": "It's a marketing term. I mean, it was one that I never had any sympathy with. The term "comic" does just as well for me. The term "graphic novel" was something that was thought up in the '80s by marketing people&nbsp;..."</ref> In the late 1980s and early 1990s he left the comic industry mainstream and went independent for a while, working on experimental work such as the epic ''From Hell'', the pornographic ''[[Lost Girls]]'', and the prose novel ''[[Voice of the Fire]]''. He subsequently returned to the mainstream later in the 1990s, working for [[Image Comics]], before developing [[America's Best Comics]], an imprint through which he published works such as ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' and the occult-based ''[[Promethea]]''.

Moore is an [[occult]]ist, [[ceremonial magic]]ian,<ref name="Babcock">{{cite journal | url=http://www.arthurmag.com/2007/05/10/1815/#more-1815|title= Magic is Afoot: A Conversation with Alan Moore about the Arts and the Occult|last= Babcock|first= Jay|journal=[[Arthur (magazine)|Arthur Magazine]]|issue= 4|date= May 2003|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130603044139/http://arthurmag.com/2007/05/10/1815/|archivedate= 3 June 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 25 January 2011}}</ref> and [[anarchist]],<ref name="Heidi, pt1"/> and has featured such themes in works including ''Promethea'', ''From Hell'', and ''V for Vendetta'', as well as performing [[avant-garde]] spoken word occult "workings" with [[The Moon and Serpent Grand Egyptian Theatre of Marvels]], some of which have been released on CD.

Despite his own personal objections, his books have provided the basis for a number of Hollywood films, including ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' (2001), ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' (2003), ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' (2005), and ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009). Moore has also been referenced in popular culture, and has been recognised as an influence on a variety of literary and television figures including [[Neil Gaiman]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Olson|first=Stephen P. |title=Neil Gaiman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jc9MaZrG3j8C&pg=PA18&dq=gaiman%20-%20moore%20-%20friendship&hl=en&ei=g-cuTfG1DsexhQeA7tHmCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false | year=2005 |location=New York|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group |pages=16–18| isbn=978-1-4042-0285-6|accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref> [[Joss Whedon]], and [[Damon Lindelof]].<ref name=EntertainmentWeekly>{{cite news| url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120854,00.html|title= Watchmen: An Oral History|last= Jensen|first= Jeff|date= 21 October 2005 |newspaper= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131214220508/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120854,00.html|archivedate= 14 December 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 13 June 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120854_5,00.html|title= Watchmen: An Oral History|first= Jeff|last= Jensen|date= 21 October 2005 |publisher= ''Entertainment Weekly''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131021120258/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1120854_5,00.html|archivedate= 21 October 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Early life==
Moore was born on 18 November 1953,<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first= John Jackson| url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays|work= [[Comics Buyer's Guide]]| date=10 June 2005|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5trAbNQWw|archivedate= 29 October 2010}}</ref> at St. Edmond's Hospital in [[Northampton]] to a working-class family who he believed had lived in the town for several generations.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=11}} He grew up in a part of Northampton known as The Boroughs, a poverty-stricken area with a lack of facilities and high levels of illiteracy, but he nonetheless "loved it. I loved the people. I loved the community and&nbsp;... I didn't know that there was anything else."<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|pages=13–16}} He lived in his house with his parents, brewery worker Ernest Moore, and printer Sylvia Doreen, with his younger brother Mike and his maternal grandmother.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=14}} He "read omnivorously" from the age of five, getting books out of the local library, and subsequently attended Spring Lane Primary School.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=17}} At the same time, he began reading comic strips, initially British strips, such as ''[[The Topper (comics)|Topper]]'' and ''[[The Beezer]]'', but eventually also American imports such as ''[[The Flash (comic book)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Detective Comics]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'', and ''[[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]]''.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=31}} He later passed his [[eleven plus]] exam, and was therefore eligible to go to [[Northampton School for Boys|Northampton Grammar School]],<ref name="bigwords1">{{cite journal | last=Groth | first=Gary | authorlink=Gary Groth | title=Big Words, Part 1 | journal=[[The Comics Journal]] | issue=138 | year=1990 | pages=56–95}}</ref> where he first came into contact with people who were middle class and better educated, and he was shocked at how he went from being one of the top pupils at his primary school to one of the lowest in the class at secondary. Subsequently disliking school and having "no interest in academic study", he believed that there was a "covert curriculum" being taught that was designed to indoctrinate children with "punctuality, obedience and the acceptance of monotony".<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|pages=17–18}}

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=right|quote="LSD was an incredible experience. Not that I'm recommending it for anybody else; but for me it kind of – it hammered home to me that reality was not a fixed thing. That the reality that we saw about us every day was one reality, and a valid one – but that there were others, different perspectives where different things have meaning that were just as valid. That had a profound effect on me."|source=Alan Moore (2003)<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|pages=19–20}}}}

In the late 1960s Moore began publishing his own poetry and essays in [[fanzine]]s, eventually setting up his own fanzine, ''Embryo''. Through ''Embryo'', Moore became involved in a group known as the [[Northampton Arts Lab]]. The Arts Lab subsequently made significant contributions to the magazine.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|pages=33–34}} He began dealing the hallucinogenic [[LSD]] at school, being expelled for doing so in 1970 – he later described himself as "one of the world's most inept LSD dealers".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7307303.stm | title=Comic legend keeps true to roots | last=Rigby | first=Nic|publisher=BBC News| date=21 March 2008 | accessdate=22 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311235237/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7307303.stm| archivedate= 11 March 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The headmaster of the school subsequently "got in touch with various other academic establishments that I'd applied to and told them not to accept me because I was a danger to the moral well-being of the rest of the students there, which was possibly true."<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=18}}

Whilst continuing to live in his parents' home for a few more years, he moved through various jobs, including cleaning toilets and working in a [[tannery]]. In late 1973, he met and began a relationship with Northampton-born Phyllis Dixon, with whom he moved into "a little one-room flat in the Barrack Road area in Northampton".<ref name="Magic Words">{{cite book | last=Parkin | first=Lance | authorlink=Lance Parkin | title=Magic Words: The Extraordinary Life of Alan Moore | date=November 2013 | location=[[London]], England | publisher=[[Aurum Press]] | isbn=978-1781310779}}{{rp|page=48}}</ref> Soon marrying, they moved into a new [[council estate]] in the town's eastern district while he worked in an office for a sub-contractor of the local gas board. Moore felt that he was not being fulfilled by this job, and so decided to try to earn a living doing something more artistic.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|pages=34–35}}

==Career==

===Early career: 1978–1980===
Abandoning his office job, he decided to instead take up both writing and illustrating his own comics. He had already produced a couple of strips for several alternative fanzines and magazines, such as ''Anon E. Mouse'' for the local paper ''Anon'', and ''St. Pancras Panda'', a parody of [[Paddington Bear]], for the Oxford-based ''Back Street Bugle''.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=16–17}} His first paid work was for a few drawings that were printed in ''[[NME]]'' music magazine, and not long after he succeeded in getting a series about a private detective known as ''Roscoe Moscow'' published using the pseudonym of Curt Vile (a pun on the name of composer [[Kurt Weill]]) in the weekly music magazine ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', earning £35 a week. Alongside this, he and Phyllis, with their newborn daughter [[Leah Moore|Leah]], began claiming [[Jobseeker's Allowance|unemployment benefit]] to supplement this income.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=36}} Not long after this, in 1979 he also began publishing a new comic strip known as ''[[Maxwell the Magic Cat]]'' in the ''Northants Post'', under the pseudonym of Jill de Ray (a pun on the Medieval child-murderer [[Gilles de Rais]], something he found to be a "sardonic joke"). Earning a further £10 a week from this, he decided to sign off of social security, and would continue writing ''Maxwell the Magic Cat'' until 1986.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|pages=36–37}} Moore has stated that he would have been happy to continue Maxwell's adventures almost indefinitely, but ended the strip after the newspaper ran a negative editorial on the place of homosexuals in the community.<ref>Moore, Alan. ''Maxwell the Magic Cat'' (Northants Post, 1979–1986) [[Trade paperback (comics)|TPB]]. Acme Press. 1986–1987. Vol. 1: ISBN 978-1-870084-00-0. Vol. 2: ISBN 978-1-870084-05-5. Vol. 3: ISBN 978-1-870084-10-9. Vol. 4: ISBN 978-1-870084-20-8</ref> Meanwhile, Moore decided to focus more fully on writing comics rather than both writing and drawing them,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/moore.htm|title= Alan Moore|date= 16 July 2010|publisher= [[Lambiek|Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131213205039/http://www.lambiek.net/artists/m/moore.htm|archivedate= 13 December 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref> stating that "After I'd been doing [it] for a couple of years, I realised that I would never be able to draw well enough and/or quickly enough to actually make any kind of decent living as an artist."<ref name="Baker, Bill">{{cite book | last=Baker | first=Bill | title=Alan Moore Spells It Out | date=28 December 2005 | publisher=Airwave Publishing | isbn=978-0-9724805-7-4}}</ref>{{rp|page=15}}

To learn more about how to write a successful comic-book script, he asked advice from his friend, comic-book writer [[Steve Moore (comics)|Steve Moore]], whom he had known since he was fourteen.<ref name="Baker, Bill"/>{{rp|page=20}} Interested in writing for ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]'', one of Britain's most prominent comic magazines, Alan Moore then submitted a script for their long running and successful series ''[[Judge Dredd]]''. Whilst having no need for another writer on ''Judge Dredd'', which was already being written by [[John Wagner]], ''2000AD'''s editor [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]] saw promise in Moore's work – later remarking that "this guy's a really fucking good writer"<ref name="TPO75">{{cite book | last=Bishop | first=David | authorlink=David Bishop | title=[[Thrill-Power Overload]] | pages=75–76 | date=15 February 2009 | publisher=[[Rebellion Developments]] | isbn=978-1-905437-95-5}}</ref> – and instead asked him to write some short stories for the publication's ''[[Future Shocks]]'' series. While the first few were rejected, Grant advised Moore on improvements, and eventually accepted the first of many. Meanwhile, Moore had also begun writing minor stories for ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Weekly]]'', and later commented that "I really, really wanted a regular strip. I didn't want to do short stories&nbsp;... But that wasn't what was being offered. I was being offered short four or five-page stories where everything had to be done in those five pages. And, looking back, it was the best possible education that I could have had in how to construct a story."<ref name="Baker, Bill"/>{{rp|pages=21–22}}

===Marvel UK, ''2000AD'', and ''Warrior'': 1980–1984===

From 1980 through to 1984, Moore maintained his status as a freelance writer, and was offered a spate of work by a variety of comic book companies in Britain, namely [[Marvel UK]], and the publishers of ''2000AD'' and ''Warrior''. He later remarked that "I remember that what was generally happening was that everybody wanted to give me work, for fear that I would just be given other work by their rivals. So everybody was offering me things."<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=57}} It was an era when comic books were increasing in popularity in Britain, and according to [[Lance Parkin]], "the British comics scene was cohering as never before, and it was clear that the audience was sticking with the title as they grew up. Comics were no longer just for very small boys: teenagers – even A-level and university students – were reading them now."<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=20}}

During this three-year period, ''2000AD'' would accept and publish over fifty of Moore's one-off stories for their ''[[Future Shocks]]'' and ''Time Twisters'' science fiction series.<ref name="TPO75"/> The editors at the magazine were impressed by Moore's work and decided to offer him a more permanent strip, starting with a story that they wanted to be vaguely based upon the hit film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''. The result, ''[[Skizz]]'', which was illustrated by [[Jim Baikie]], told the story of the titular alien who crashes to Earth and is cared for by a woman named Roxy, and Moore later noted that in his opinion, this work "owes far too much to [[Alan Bleasdale]]."<ref name="Bishop, David">{{cite book | last=Bishop | first=David | title=Thrill-Power Overload: The Official History of 2000AD | date=30 March 2007 | publisher=Rebellion Developments | isbn=978-1-905437-22-1}}</ref>{{rp|page=94}} Another series he produced for ''2000AD'' was ''[[D.R. and Quinch]]'', which was illustrated by [[Alan Davis]]. The story, which Moore described as "continuing the tradition of [[Dennis the Menace (UK)|Dennis the Menace]], but giving him a [[thermonuclear]] capacity",<ref name="Bishop, David"/>{{rp|page=99}} revolved around two delinquent aliens, and was a science-fiction take on ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'''s characters [[O.C. and Stiggs]]. The work widely considered to be the highlight of his ''2000AD'' career,<ref name="Bishop, David"/>{{rp|pages=100–110}} and that he himself described as "the one that worked best for me"<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=58}} was ''[[The Ballad of Halo Jones]]''.<ref name="Bishop, David"/>{{rp|pages=99–102}} Co-created with artist [[Ian Gibson (comics)|Ian Gibson]], the series was set in the 50th century. It finished before all the episodes were written.

Another comic company to employ Moore was Marvel UK, who had formerly purchased a few of his one-off stories for ''Doctor Who Weekly'' and ''Star Wars Weekly''. Aiming to get an older audience than ''2000AD'', their main rival, they employed Moore to write for the regular strip ''[[Captain Britain]]'', "halfway through a storyline that he's neither inaugurated nor completely understood."<ref name="Moore, Alan 2002">{{cite book | last=Moore | first=Alan |author2=[[Alan Davis|Davis, Alan]] | title=Captain Britain | date=1 February 2002 | publisher=[[Marvel Comics]] | isbn=978-0-7851-0855-9}}</ref> He replaced the former writer Dave Thorpe, but maintained the original artist, Alan Davis, whom Moore described as "an artist whose love for the medium and whose sheer exultation upon finding himself gainfully employed within it shine from every line, every new costume design, each nuance of expression."<ref name="Moore, Alan 2002"/>

The third comic company that Moore worked for in this period was a new monthly magazine known as ''Warrior'', founded by [[Dez Skinn]], a former editor of both IPC (publishers of ''2000 AD'') and Marvel UK, that was designed to offer writers a greater degree of freedom over their artistic creations than was allowed by pre-existing companies, and it was at ''Warrior'' that Moore "would start to reach his potential".<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=21}} Moore was initially given two ongoing strips in ''Warrior'': ''[[Marvelman]]'' and ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', both of which debuted in ''Warrior'''s first issue in March 1982. ''V for Vendetta'' was a dystopian thriller set in a future 1997 where a fascist government controlled Britain, opposed only by a lone [[anarchism|anarchist]] dressed in a [[Guy Fawkes]] costume who turns to terrorism to topple the government. Illustrated by [[David Lloyd (comics)|David Lloyd]], Moore was influenced by his pessimistic feelings about the [[Thatcherite]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, which he projected forward as a fascist state in which all ethnic and sexual minorities had been eliminated. It has been regarded as "among Moore's best work" and has maintained a cult following throughout subsequent decades.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=22}}

''Marvelman'' (later retitled ''Miracleman'' for legal reasons) was a series that originally had been published in Britain from 1954 through to 1963, based largely upon the American comic ''[[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]]''. Upon resurrecting ''Marvelman'', Moore "took a kitsch children's character and placed him within the real world of 1982".<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=23}} The work was drawn primarily by [[Garry Leach]] and Alan Davis.<ref>{{cite book | last=Khoury | first=George | title=Kimota!: The Miracleman Companion | date=1 September 2001 | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | isbn=978-1-893905-11-5}}</ref> The third series that Moore produced for ''Warrior'' was ''[[The Bojeffries Saga]]'', a comedy about a working-class English family of [[vampires]] and [[werewolves]], drawn by [[Steve Parkhouse]]. ''Warrior'' closed before these stories were completed,<ref name="OGWS">{{cite book | last=Knowles | first=Christopher | authorlink=Christopher Knowles (comics) | others=Illustrated by [[Joseph Michael Linsner]] | title=[[Our Gods Wear Spandex]] | publisher=[[Red Wheel Weiser Conari|Weiser]] | date=1 November 2007 | page=199 | isbn=978-1-57863-406-4}}</ref><ref name="RCMB"/><ref name="TBTMP">{{cite book | last=Khoury | first=George | title=True Brit | publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing | date=July 2004 | pages=23–25 | isbn=978-1-893905-33-7}}</ref> but under new publishers both ''Miracleman'' and ''V for Vendetta'' were resumed by Moore, who finished both stories by 1989. Moore's biographer Lance Parkin remarked that "reading them through together throws up some interesting contrasts – in one the hero fights a fascist dictatorship based in London, in the other an [[Aryan]] superman imposes one."<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=26}}

Meanwhile, during this same period, he – using the pseudonym of Translucia Baboon – became involved in the music scene, founding his own band, The Sinister Ducks, with [[David J]] (of goth band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]) and Alex Green, and in 1983 released a single, ''March of the Sinister Ducks'', with sleeve art by illustrator [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]].

Moore began producing further stories for DC Comics, including a two-part story for ''[[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]'', which dealt with domestic abuse. He was eventually given the chance to write a story for one of DC's best-known superheroes, [[Superman]], entitled "[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]", which was illustrated by [[Dave Gibbons]] and released in 1985.<ref>Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 214: "The legendary writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons teamed up once again with the just-as-legendary Man of Tomorrow for a special that saw Superman&nbsp;... held in the sway of the Black Mercy."</ref> In this story, [[Wonder Woman]], [[Batman]], and [[Jason Todd|Robin]] visit Superman on his birthday, only to find that he has been overcome by an alien organism and is hallucinating about his heart's desire.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=37}} He followed this with another Superman story, "[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]", which was published in 1986.

The limited series ''[[Watchmen]]'', begun in 1986 and collected as a trade paperback in 1987, cemented Moore's reputation. Imagining what the world would be like if costumed heroes had really existed since the 1940s, Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]] created a [[Cold War]] mystery in which the shadow of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] threatens the world. The heroes who are caught up in this escalating crisis either work for the US government or are outlawed, and are motivated to heroism by their various psychological hang-ups. ''Watchmen'' is non-linear and told from multiple points of view, and includes highly sophisticated self-references, ironies, and formal experiments such as the symmetrical design of issue 5, "Fearful Symmetry", where the last page is a near mirror-image of the first, the second-last of the second, and so on, and in this manner is an early example of Moore's interest in the human perception of time and its implications for free will. It is the only comic to win the [[Hugo Award]], in a one-time category ("Best Other Form").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=11 | title=The Hugo Awards: Ask a Question | date=23 February 2008 | accessdate=22 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228150704/http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=11| archivedate= 28 February 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> It is widely seen as Moore's best work, and has been regularly described as the greatest comic book ever written.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=39–40}} Alongside roughly contemporary works such as Frank Miller's ''Batman: The Dark Knight Returns'', [[Art Spiegelman]]'s ''[[Maus]]'', and [[Jaime Hernandez|Jaime]] and [[Gilbert Hernandez]]'s ''[[Love and Rockets (comics)|Love and Rockets]]'', ''Watchmen'' was part of a late 1980s trend in American comics towards more adult sensibilities.<ref>Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 220: "The story itself was a masterful example of comic book storytelling at its finest&nbsp;... Filled with symbolism, foreshadowing, and ahead-of-its-time characterization thanks to adult themes and sophisticated plotting, ''Watchmen'' elevated the super hero comic book into the realms of true modern literature."</ref> Comics historian [[Les Daniels]] noted that ''Watchmen'' "called into question the basic assumptions on which the super hero genre is formulated".<ref>{{cite book|last = Daniels|first = Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title = DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes|publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company|Bulfinch Press]]|year = 1995|page = 196|isbn = 0-8212-2076-4}}</ref> DC Comics writer and executive [[Paul Levitz]] observed in 2010 that "As with ''The Dark Knight Returns'', ''Watchmen'' set off a chain reaction of rethinking the nature of super heroes and heroism itself, and pushed the genre darker for more than a decade.

He and Gibbons had earlier created the character [[Mogo]] as part of DC's [[Green Lantern Corps]]<ref>{{cite web |url= http://io9.com/5812496/a-beginners-guide-to-everything-green-lantern|title= A beginner's guide to Green Lantern|first= Alasdair|last= Wilkins|date= 16 June 2011|publisher= [[io9]]|deadurl= no|quote= ''DC Universe: The Stories of Alan Moore'' features three absolutely crucial Green Lantern stories: 'Mogo Doesn't Socialize', which introduced everyone's favorite sentient planet.}}</ref> and a short story by Moore and artist [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] published in ''Green Lantern Corps Annual'' No. 2 (1986) was one of the inspirations for the "[[Blackest Night]]" storyline in 2009-2010.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://comicsalliance.com/alan-moore-puts-on-red-lantern-ring-takes-a-potshot-at-blackes/|title= Alan Moore Puts on Red Lantern Ring, Takes a Potshot at ''Blackest Night''|first= Laura|last= Hudson|date= 22 September 2009|publisher= [[Townsquare Media|ComicsAlliance]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150914195122/http://comicsalliance.com/alan-moore-puts-on-red-lantern-ring-takes-a-potshot-at-blackes/|archivedate= 14 September 2015|deadurl= no|quote= Alan Moore criticized the dearth of new ideas in modern superhero comics, and then went after DC writer Geoff Johns by claiming that his ''Blackest Night'' storyline was a ripoff of Moore’s old ''Tales of the Green Lantern'' story.}}</ref>

In 1987 Moore submitted a proposal for a miniseries called ''[[Twilight of the Superheroes]]'', the title a twist on [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Götterdämmerung]]'' (meaning "Twilight of the Gods"). The series was set in the future of the DC Universe, where the world is ruled by superheroic dynasties, including the House of Steel (presided over by Superman and Wonder Woman) and the House of Thunder (led by the [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] family). These two houses are about to unite through a dynastic marriage, their combined power potentially threatening freedom, and several characters, including John Constantine, attempt to stop it and free humanity from the power of superheroes. The series would also have restored the DC Universe's multiple earths, which had been eliminated in the continuity-revising 1985 limited series ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. The series was never commissioned, but copies of Moore's detailed notes have appeared on the Internet and in print despite the efforts of DC, who consider the proposal their property.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=43–44}} Similar elements, such as the concept of [[Hypertime (comics)|hypertime]], have since appeared in DC comics. The 1996 miniseries ''[[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]]'' by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]], was also set amid a superheroic conflict in the future of the DC Universe. Waid and Ross have stated that they had read the ''Twilight'' proposal before starting work on their series, but that any similarities are both minor and unintended.<ref name="TBTMP"/>

Moore wrote the lead story in ''Batman Annual'' No. 11 (1987) drawn by [[George Freeman (comics)|George Freeman]].<ref>{{cite book|last= Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dougall|first2=Alastair, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title= Batman: A Visual History|publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]]|year= 2014|page= 169|isbn= 978-1465424563|quote=  Alan Moore crafted yet another timeless tale in this annual.

Moore's relationship with DC Comics had gradually deteriorated over the issues of creator's rights and merchandising. Moore and Gibbons were not paid any royalties for a ''Watchmen'' spin-off badge set, as DC defined them as a "promotional item",<ref name="vendettavendetta">{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/12itzk.html?_r=2&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin|title=The Vendetta Behind ''V for Vendetta''|last= Itzkoff|first= Dave|date= 12 March 2006 |work= The New York Times|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140403235535/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/movies/12itzk.html?_r=3&oref=slogin&pagewanted=all&oref=slogin&|archivedate= 3 April 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref> and according to certain reports, he and Gibbons gained only 2% of the profits earned by DC for ''Watchmen''.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=44}} Meanwhile, a group of creators including Moore, Frank Miller, [[Marv Wolfman]], and [[Howard Chaykin]], fell out with DC over a proposed age-rating system similar to those used for films.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=44–45}} After completing ''V for Vendetta'', which DC had already begun publishing, thus enabling him to finish the final few episodes, in 1989,<ref>Manning "1980s" in Dolan, p. 234: "A fable of revolution and a cautionary tale of lost freedoms, ''V For Vendetta'' was a triumph for Moore, this time aided by the shadowy pencils of David Lloyd."</ref> Moore stopped working for DC.

===Independent period and Mad Love: 1988–1993===

Abandoning DC Comics and the mainstream, Moore, with his wife Phyllis and their mutual lover Deborah Delano, set up their own comics publishing company, which they named Mad Love. The works that they published in Mad Love turned away from the science fiction and superhero genres that Moore was used to writing, instead focusing on realism, ordinary people, and political causes. Mad Love's first publication, ''[[AARGH (Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia)|AARGH]]'', was an anthology of work by a number of writers (including Moore) that challenged the Thatcher government's recently introduced [[Section 28|Clause 28]], a law designed to prevent councils and schools "promoting homosexuality". Sales from the book went towards the Organisation of Lesbian and Gay Action, and Moore was "very pleased with" it, stating that "we hadn't prevented this bill from becoming law, but we had joined in the general uproar against it, which prevented it from ever becoming as viciously effective as its designers might have hoped."<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=149}}<ref>{{cite journal | last=Gravett | first=Paul | authorlink=Paul Gravett | url=http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/alan_moore/ | title=Alan Moore: No More Sex|journal=[[Escape (magazine)|Escape]]|issue=15|year=1988|editor1-last=Gravett|editor1-first=Paul|editor2-last=Stanbury|editor2-first=Peter|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130706175957/http://paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/alan_moore|archivedate= 6 July 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref> Moore followed this with a second political work, ''Shadowplay: The Secret Team'', a comic illustrated by [[Bill Sienkiewicz]] for [[Eclipse Comics]] and commissioned by the [[Christic Institute]], which was included as a part of the anthology ''[[Brought to Light]]'', a description of the [[CIA]]'s covert drug smuggling and arms dealing.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=47}}  In 1998 '[[Brought to Light]]' was adapted by Moore in collaboration with composer [[Gary Lloyd]] as a narrative and music work which was released on cd.

After prompting by cartoonist and self-publishing advocate [[Dave Sim]],<ref name="bigwords1"/> Moore then used Mad Love to publish his next project, ''[[Big Numbers (comics)|Big Numbers]]'', a proposed 12-issue series set in "a hardly-disguised version of Moore's native Northampton" known as Hampton, and deals with the effects of big business on ordinary people and with ideas of [[chaos theory]].<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=48}} Illustration of the comic was begun by Bill Sienkiewicz, who left the series after only two issues in 1990, and despite plans that his assistant, [[Al Columbia]], would replace him, it never occurred and the series [[List of comics solicited but never published|remained unfinished]].<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=48–49}}<ref>{{cite journal | last=Gravett | first=Paul | url=http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/al_columbia/  | title=Al Columbia: Columbia's Voyage of Discovery | journal=The Comics Journal | issue=Special Edition | date=Winter 2002 | accessdate=22 March 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100826155216/http://www.paulgravett.com/index.php/articles/article/al_columbia/ |archivedate = 26 August 2010}}</ref> Following this, in 1991 the company [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] published Moore's ''[[A Small Killing]]'', a full length story illustrated by [[Oscar Zarate]], about a once idealistic advertising executive haunted by his boyhood self. According to Lance Parkin, ''A Small Killing'' is "quite possibly Moore's most underrated work."<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=49}} Soon after this, Mad Love itself was disbanded as Phyllis and Deborah ended their relationship with Moore, taking with them much of the money that he had earned from his work in the 1980s.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=25}}

Meanwhile, Moore began producing work for ''[[Taboo (comics)|Taboo]]'', a small independent comic anthology edited by his former collaborator [[Stephen R. Bissette]]. The first of these was ''[[From Hell]]'', a fictionalised account of the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders of the 1880s. Inspired by [[Douglas Adams]]' novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'',<ref>{{cite web |last= Graydon|first= Danny|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/10/22/alan_moore_2001_interview.shtml | title=Interview – Alan Moore |publisher=[[BBC Films]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090311011452/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/10/22/alan_moore_2001_interview.shtml|archivedate= 11 March 2009|deadurl= no| accessdate=10 February 2007}}</ref> Moore reasoned that to solve a crime [[holism|holistically]], one would need to solve the entire society it occurred in, and depicts the murders as a consequence of the politics and economics of the time. Just about every notable figure of the period is connected with the events in some way, including "Elephant Man" [[Joseph Merrick]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] writer [[Black Elk]], [[William Morris]], artist [[Walter Sickert]], and [[Aleister Crowley]], who makes a brief appearance as a young boy. Illustrated in a sooty pen-and-ink style by [[Eddie Campbell]], ''From Hell'' took nearly ten years to complete, outlasting ''Taboo'' and going through two more publishers before being collected as a trade paperback by Eddie Campbell Comics. It was widely praised, with comics author [[Warren Ellis]] calling it "my all-time favourite graphic novel".<ref>{{cite web|last= Ellis |first= Warren|authorlink= Warren Ellis|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,479890,00.html|title=Review of ''From Hell''|work=Entertainment Weekly|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130719090833/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,479890,00.html|archivedate= 19 July 2013|deadurl= no|date= 5 September 2003}}</ref>

The other series that Moore began for ''Taboo'' was ''[[Lost Girls]]'', which he described as a work of intelligent "pornography".<ref name=SFW>{{cite web | url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw13282.html | title=Alan Moore leaves behind his ''Extraordinary Gentlemen'' to dally with ''Lost Girls'' | accessdate=8 August 2006 | last=Schindler | first=Dorman T. | date=7 August 2006 | work=[[Science Fiction Weekly]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811174459/http://www.scifi.com/sfw/interviews/sfw13282.html  | archivedate=11 August 2006}}</ref> Illustrated by [[Melinda Gebbie]], with whom Moore subsequently entered into a relationship, it was set in 1913, where [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'', [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]] from ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and [[Wendy Darling|Wendy]] from ''[[Peter Pan]]'' – who are each of a different age and class – all meet in a European hotel and regale each other with tales of their sexual encounters.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=49–50}} With the work, Moore wanted to attempt something innovative in comics, and believed that creating comics pornography was a way of achieving this. He remarked that "I had a lot of different ideas as to how it might be possible to do an up-front sexual comic strip and to do it in a way that would remove a lot of what I saw were the problems with pornography in general. That it's mostly ugly, it's mostly boring, it's not inventive – it has no standards."<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|pages=154–155}} Like ''From Hell'', ''Lost Girls'' outlasted ''Taboo'', and a few subsequent instalments were published erratically until the work was finished and a complete edition published in 2006.

Meanwhile, Moore set about writing a prose novel, eventually producing ''[[Voice of the Fire]]'', which would be published in 1996. Unconventional in tone, the novel was a set of short stories about linked events in his hometown of Northampton through the centuries, from the [[Bronze Age]] to the present day, which combined to tell a larger story.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=92}}

===Return to the mainstream and Image Comics: 1993–1998===
In 1993 Moore declared himself to be a [[ceremonial magician]]. The same year marked a move by Moore back to the mainstream comics industry and back to writing superhero comics. He did so through the [[Image Comics]], widely known at the time for its flashy artistic style, graphic violence, and scantily clad large-breasted women, something that horrified many of his fans.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=55}} His first work published by Image, an issue of the series ''[[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]]'', was soon followed by the creation of his own mini-series, ''[[1963 (comics)|1963]]'', which was "a pastiche of [[Jack Kirby]] stories drawn for [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] in the sixties, with their rather overblown style, colourful characters and cosmic style."<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=56}} According to Moore, "after I'd done the ''1963'' stuff I'd become aware of how much the comic audience had changed while I'd been away [since 1988]. That all of a sudden it seemed that the bulk of the audience really wanted things that had almost no story, just lots of big, full-page pin-up sort of pieces of artwork. And I was genuinely interested to see if I could write a decent story for that market."<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=173}}

He subsequently set about writing what he saw as "better than average stories for 13- to 15-year olds", including three mini-series based upon the ''Spawn'' series: ''[[Violator (comics)|Violator]]'', ''Violator/[[Badrock]]'', and ''Spawn: Blood Feud''.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=56}} In 1995, he was also given control of a regular monthly comic, [[Jim Lee]]'s ''[[Wildcats (comics)|WildC.A.T.S.]]'', starting from issue No. 21, which he would continue to write for fourteen issues. The series followed two groups of superheroes, one of whom are on a spaceship heading back to their home planet, and the others who are instead remaining on Earth. Moore's biographer Lance Parkin remarked critically of the series, feeling that it was one of Moore's worst, and that "you feel Moore should be better than this. It's not special."<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=56}} Moore himself, who remarked that he took on the series – his only regular monthly comic series since ''Swamp Thing'' – largely because he liked Jim Lee, admitted that he was not entirely happy with the work, believing that he had catered too much to his conceptions of what the fans wanted rather than being innovative.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=174}}

Next he took over [[Rob Liefeld]]'s ''[[Supreme (comics)|Supreme]]'', about a character with many similarities with DC Comics' [[Superman]]. Instead of emphasising increased realism as he had done with earlier superhero comics he had taken over, Moore did the opposite, and began basing the series on the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] Superman comics of the 1960s, introducing a female superhero Suprema, a super-dog Radar, and a [[Kryptonite]]-like material known as Supremium, in doing so harking back to the original "mythic" figure of the American superhero. Under Moore, Supreme would prove to be a critical and commercial success, announcing that he was back in the mainstream after several years of self-imposed exile.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=59–60}}

When Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, split from the publisher and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore to create a new universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image. Moore's "solution was breathtaking and cocky – he created a long and distinguished history for these new characters, retro-fitting a fake silver and gold age for them." Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as ''[[Glory (comics)|Glory]]'' and ''[[Youngblood (comics)|Youngblood]]'', as well as a three-part mini-series known as ''[[Judgment Day (Awesome Comics)|Judgment Day]]'' to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=60–61}} Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him. And also by then I was probably feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, [[Jim Valentino]] – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to my eyes, to be less than gentlemen. They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with."<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=175}}

===America's Best Comics: 1999–2008===
{{Main|America's Best Comics}}
Image partner Jim Lee offered to provide Moore with his own imprint, which would be under Lee's company [[WildStorm Productions]]. Moore named this imprint [[America's Best Comics]], lining up a series of artists and writers to assist him in this venture. Lee soon sold WildStorm – including America's Best Comics – to DC Comics, and "Moore found himself back with a company he'd vowed to never work with again". Lee and editor [[Scott Dunbier]] flew to England personally to reassure Moore that he would not be affected by the sale, and would not have to deal with DC directly.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://twistandshoutcomics.com/features/columns/rrevs0898.html  | last=Johnston | first=Rich | authorlink=Rich Johnston | title=Lee Spotting | work=Rich's Ramblings '98 | date=31 August 1998 | accessdate=23 March 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013083745/http://twistandshoutcomics.com/features/columns/rrevs0898.html |archivedate = 13 October 2007}}</ref> Moore decided that there were too many people involved to back out from the project, and so ABC was launched in early 1999.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=62}}

The first series published by ABC was ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', which featured a variety of characters from [[Victorian era|Victorian]] adventure novels, such as [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s [[Allan Quatermain]], [[H. G. Wells]]' [[The Invisible Man|Invisible Man]], [[Jules Verne]]'s [[Captain Nemo]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]], and Wilhelmina Murray from [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''. Illustrated by [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], the first volume of the series pitted the League against [[Professor Moriarty]] from the ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' books; the second, against the Martians from ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''.<ref>Cowsill, Alan "2000s" in Dolan, p. 307</ref> A third volume entitled ''[[The Black Dossier]]'' was set in the 1950s. The series was well received, and Moore was pleased that an American audience was enjoying something he considered "perversely English", and that it was inspiring some readers to get interested in Victorian literature.<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=183}}

Another of Moore's ABC works was ''[[Tom Strong]]'', a post-modern superhero series, featured a hero inspired by characters pre-dating Superman, such as [[Doc Savage]] and [[Tarzan]]. The character's drug-induced longevity allowed Moore to include flashbacks to Strong's adventures throughout the 20th century, written and drawn in period styles, as a comment on the history of comics and [[Pulp magazine|pulp fiction]]. The primary artist was [[Chris Sprouse]]. ''Tom Strong'' bore many similarities to Moore's earlier work on ''Supreme'', but according to Lance Parkin, was "more subtle", and was "ABC's most accessible comic."<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=64–65}}

Moore's ''[[Top 10 (comics)|Top 10]]'', a deadpan [[police procedural]] drama set in a city called Neopolis where everyone, including the police, criminals, and civilians has super-powers, costumes, and secret identities, was drawn by [[Gene Ha]] and [[Zander Cannon]].<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|pages=65–66,71}} The series ended after twelve issues, but has spawned four spin-offs: a miniseries ''[[Smax]]'', which was set in a [[fantasy]] realm and drawn by Cannon; ''[[Top 10: The Forty-Niners]]'', a prequel to the main ''Top Ten'' series drawn by Ha;<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=68}}<ref>Cowsill "2000s" in Dolan, p. 320: "A graphic novel prequel to the award-winning ''Top 10'' series, ''The Forty-Niners'' proved to be one of the best books of the year."</ref> and two sequel miniseries, ''[[Top 10: Beyond the Farthest Precinct]]'', which was written by [[Paul Di Filippo]] and drawn by [[Jerry Ordway]], and ''Top 10: Season Two'', written by Cannon and drawn by Ha.

Moore's series ''[[Promethea]]'', which told the story of a teenage girl, Sophie Bangs, who is possessed by an ancient pagan goddess, the titular Promethea, explored many occult themes, particularly the [[Qabalah]] and the concept of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], with Moore stating that "I wanted to be able to do an occult comic that didn't portray the occult as a dark, scary place, because that's not my experience of it&nbsp;... [''Promethea'' was] more psychedelic&nbsp;... more sophisticated, more experimental, more ecstatic and exuberant."<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=188}} Drawn by [[J. H. Williams III]], it has been described as "a personal statement" from Moore, being one of his most personal works, and that it encompasses "a belief system, a personal cosmology".<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=68}}

ABC Comics was also used to publish an anthology series, ''[[Tomorrow Stories]]'', which featured a regular cast of characters such as [[Cobweb (comics)|Cobweb]], [[First American (comics)|First American]], [[Greyshirt (comics)|Greyshirt]], [[Jack B. Quick]], and [[Splash Brannigan]]. ''Tomorrow Stories'' was notable for being an anthology series, a medium that had largely died out in American comics at the time.<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=66}}

Despite the assurances that DC Comics would not interfere with Moore and his work, they subsequently did so, angering him. Specifically, in ''League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' No. 5, an authentic vintage advertisement for a "Marvel"-brand [[douche]] caused DC executive [[Paul Levitz]] to order the entire print run destroyed and reprinted with the advertisement amended to "Amaze", to avoid friction with DC's competitor [[Marvel Comics]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.recalledcomics.com/LeagueOfExtraOrdinaryGentlemen5RecalledMarvelAd.php | title=''League of Extraordinary Gentlemen No.&nbsp;5 Recalled'' |publisher=Recalled Comics.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131031144213/http://recalledcomics.com/LeagueOfExtraOrdinaryGentlemen5RecalledMarvelAd.php|archivedate= 31 October 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref> A ''Cobweb'' story Moore wrote for ''[[Tomorrow Stories]]'' No.&nbsp;8 featuring references to [[L. Ron Hubbard]], American occultist [[John Whiteside Parsons|Jack Parsons]], and the "[[Babalon Working]]", was blocked by DC Comics due to the subject matter. DC had already published a version of the same event in their [[Paradox Press]] volume ''[[The Big Book of#Conspiracies|The Big Book of Conspiracies]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last = Cronin|first = Brian|title = Was Superman a Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed|publisher = [[Plume (publisher)|Plume]]|year = 2009|pages = |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=SFgiXbVykSIC&pg=PT81&lpg=PT81&dq=DC+Comics+L+Ron+Hubbard&source=bl&ots=M7hKuxFLFt&sig=ox8kEh9wmRPuaKFlJNwqoSJZWFk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9fk9U6KbHqbLsAT54IGwCA&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=DC%20Comics%20L%20Ron%20Hubbard&f=false|isbn = 978-0-452-29532-2}}</ref>

In 2003, a documentary about him was made by Shadowsnake Films, titled ''[[The Mindscape of Alan Moore]]'', which was later released on DVD.<ref name="Moore Documentary">{{cite video | people=DeZ Vylenz (Director) | date=30 September 2008 | title=The Mindscape of Alan Moore | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410321/ | medium=Documentary | publisher=Shadowsnake Films}}</ref>

With many of the stories he had planned for America's Best Comics brought to an end, and with his increasing dissatisfaction with how DC Comics were interfering with his work, he decided to once more pull out of the comics mainstream. In 2005, he remarked that "I love the comics medium. I pretty much detest the comics industry. Give it another 15 months, I'll probably be pulling out of mainstream, commercial comics."<ref name="Baker, Bill"/>{{rp|page=65}} The only ABC title continued by Moore was ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen''; after cutting ties with DC he launched the new ''League'' saga, ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume III: Century|Volume III: Century]]'', in a co-publishing partnership of [[Top Shelf Productions]] and [[Knockabout Comics]], the first part released in 2009, the second in 2011 and the third released in 2012.

In 2006, the complete edition of ''[[Lost Girls]]'' was published, as a slipcased set of three hardcover volumes. The same year Moore published an eight-page article tracing out the history of pornography in which he argued that a society's vibrancy and success are related to its permissiveness in sexual matters. Decrying that the consumption of contemporary ubiquitous pornography was still widely considered shameful, he called for a new and more artistic pornography that could be openly discussed and would have a beneficial impact on society.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.arthurmag.com/pdfs/Arthur25Part1of3.pdf | title=Bog Venus Versus Nazi Cock-Ring: Some Thoughts Concerning Pornography (Arthur Magazine #25 PDF file – Part 1) | journal=[[Arthur (magazine)|Arthur Magazine]] | volume=1 | issue=25 |date=November 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.arthurmag.com/pdfs/Arthur25Part2of3.pdf | title=Bog Venus Versus Nazi Cock-Ring: Some Thoughts Concerning Pornography (Arthur Magazine #25 PDF file – Part 2) | journal=[[Arthur (magazine)|Arthur Magazine]] | volume=1 | issue=25 |date=November 2006}}</ref> He expanded on this for a 2009 book-length essay entitled ''25,000 years of Erotic Freedom'', which was described by a reviewer as "a tremendously witty history lecture – a sort of ''[[Horrible Histories]]'' for grownups."<ref>{{cite web | last=Jones | first=Jonathan | authorlink=Jonathan Jones (journalist) | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/jan/04/alan-moore-graphic-sex-art | title=From graphic novels to graphic sex: Alan Moore's history of erotic art |work= [[The Guardian]]| date=4 January 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131024132540/http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2010/jan/04/alan-moore-graphic-sex-art|archivedate= 24 October 2013|deadurl= no| accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref>

==Work==

===Themes===
In a number of his comics, where he was taking over from earlier writers, including ''Marvelman'', ''Swamp Thing'', and ''Supreme'', he used the "familiar tactic of wiping out what had gone before, giving the hero amnesia and revealing that everything we'd learned to that point was a lie."<ref name="Parkin, Lance"/>{{rp|page=58}} In this manner he was largely able to start afresh with the character and their series and was not constrained by earlier canon. While commenting on the artistic restrictiveness of serialised comic books, artist [[Josef Rubinstein|Joe Rubinstein]] gave the example that a comics creator would be limited in what he could do with [[Spider-Man]], and added, "unless you're Alan Moore, who would probably kill him and bring him back as a real spider or something".<ref>{{cite news | author = Henderson, Chris | date = July 1986 | title = Joe Rubinstein | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 36 | page = 49 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}</ref>

===Recognition and awards===
Moore's work in the comic book medium has been widely recognised by his peers and by critics. Comics historian [[George Khoury]] asserted that "to call this free spirit the best writer in the history of comic books is an understatement"<ref name="Khoury, George"/>{{rp|page=10}} whilst interviewer Steve Rose referred to him as "the [[Orson Welles]] of comics" who is "the undisputed high priest of the medium, whose every word is seized upon like a message from the ether" by comic book fans.<ref name="Moore's murderer">{{cite web | last=Rose | first=Steve | url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/sciencefiction/story/0,6000,643500,00.html | title=Moore's murderer |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=2 February 2002 | accessdate=12 March 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060219151930/http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/sciencefiction/story/0,6000,643500,00.html| archivedate= 19 February 2006 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Douglas Wolk observed: "Moore has undisputably made it into the Hall of Fame: he's one of the pillars of English language comics, alongside Jack Kirby and Will Eisner and Harvey Kurtzman and not many others. He's also the grand exception in that hall, since the other pillars are artists – and more often than not, writer/artists. Moore is a writer almost exclusively, though his hyper detailed scripts always play to the strengths of the artists he works with. That makes him the chief monkey wrench in comics author theory. The main reason that almost nobody's willing to say that a single cartoonist is ''categorically'' superior to a writer/artist team is that such a rule would run smack into Moore's bibliography. In fact, a handful of cartoonists who almost always write the stories they draw have made exceptions for Moore – [[Jaime Hernandez]], [[Mark Beyer (comics)|Mark Beyer]] and most memorably Eddie Campbell."<ref name="Wolk">{{cite book | last=Wolk | first=Douglas | authorlink=Douglas Wolk | title=Reading Comics | year=2007 | location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] | publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] | isbn=978-0-306-81616-1}}</ref>{{rp|page=229}}

Moore has won multiple [[Eagle Awards]], including virtually a "clean sweep" in 1986 for his work on ''Watchmen'' and ''Swamp Thing''. Moore not only won "favourite writer in both the US and UK categories", but had his work win for favourite comic book, supporting character, and new title in the US; and character, continuing story and "character worthy of own title" in the UK (in which last category his works held all top three spots).<ref name="Speak64">{{cite journal | last=Ridout | first=Cefn | editor1-last=Bambos | editor2-last=Hanson | editor2-first=Dick | editor3-last=Ashford | editor3-first=Richard | title=Eagle Ayes | journal=Speakeasy | issue=64 | date=July 1986 | page=3}}</ref>

Moore has been nominated for the ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' Fan Awards several times, winning for Favorite Writer in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1999, and 2000. He won the CBG Fan Award for Favorite Comic Book Story (''Watchmen'') in 1987 and Favorite Original Graphic Novel or Album (''[[Batman: The Killing Joke]]'' with [[Brian Bolland]]) in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|last = Thompson|first = Maggie (ed.)|authorlink = Maggie Thompson|title = Comics Buyer's Guide 1996 Annual|publisher = [[Krause Publications]]|year = 1995|pages = 30–31|isbn = 978-0-87341-406-7}}</ref>

He has received the [[Eisner Award]] for Best Writer nine times since 1988, and among his numerous international prizes are the German [[Max & Moritz Prize]] for an exceptional oeuvre (2008) and the British [[National Comics Awards|National Comics Award]] for Best Comics Writer Ever (in 2001 and 2002). He also won French awards like the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Album]] for ''Watchmen'' in 1989 and ''V for Vendetta'' in 1990, and the [[Prix de la critique]] for ''From Hell'' in 2001, the Swedish [[Urhunden Prizes|Urhunden Prize]] in 1992 for ''Watchmen'' and several Spanish [[Haxtur Awards]], in 1988 for ''Watchmen'' and 1989 for ''Swamp Thing'' No.&nbsp;5 (both for Best Writer).

Moore was also lauded outside the world of comics. In 1988, Moore and artist [[Dave Gibbons]] won a [[Hugo Award]] in the category Other Forms for ''Watchmen''. The category was created for that year only, via a rarely used provision that allows the Committee of the [[Worldcon]] to create any temporary Additional Category it feels appropriate (no subsequent committee has repeated this category).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.dpsinfo.com/awardweb/hugos/80s.html#1988|title= 1988 Hugo Winners|publisher=Dpsinfo.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140209170658/http://dpsinfo.com/awardweb/hugos/80s.html|archivedate= 9 February 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=20 January 2011}}</ref>

In 1988 he received a [[World Fantasy Award for Best Novella]] for ''A Hypothetical Lizard'', which [[Avatar Press]] published in 2004 as a comics adaption by [[Antony Johnston]]. Moore also won two [[International Horror Guild Award]]s in the category Graphic Story/Illustrated Narrative (in 1995 with [[Eddie Campbell]] for ''From Hell'' and in 2003 with [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] for ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horroraward.org/prevrec.html |title=IHG Award Recipients | publisher=International Horror Guild | accessdate=1 February 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5hhhbRuwD | archivedate = 21 June 2009| deadurl=no}}</ref> Moore received a [[Bram Stoker Award]] in the category Best Illustrated Narrative for ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' in 2000, then again in 2012 for ''[[Neonomicon]]'' as Best Graphic Novel.

In 2005, ''Watchmen'' was the only graphic novel to make it onto [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s "The 100 Best Novels from 1923 to the Present" list.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/0,24459,watchmen,00.html | title=All-Time 100 Novels | last=Grossman | first=Lev | authorlink=Lev Grossman |author2=Lacayo, Richard | date=16 October 2005 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| accessdate=23 April 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mqgDc0r3 | archivedate = 17 January 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Film adaptations==
Due to the success of his comics, a number of filmmakers have expressed a desire to make film adaptations over the years. Moore himself has consistently opposed such ventures, stating that "I wanted to give comics a special place when I was writing things like ''Watchmen''. I wanted to show off just what the possibilities of the comic book medium were, and films are completely different."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/film/features/4187/alan-moore| title= Alan Moore – Writer of ''Watchmen''|last= Dent|first= Nick|work= [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out Sydney]]|date= March 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120723003721/http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/film/features/4187/alan-moore|archivedate= 23 July 2012|deadurl= no}}</ref> Expressing similar sentiments, he also remarked that "If we only see comics in relation to movies then the best that they will ever be is films that do not move. I found it, in the mid 80s, preferable to concentrate on those things that only comics could achieve. The way in which a tremendous amount of information could be included visually in every panel, the juxtapositions between what a character was saying, and what the image that the reader was looking at would be. So in a sense&nbsp;... most of my work from the 80s onwards was designed to be un-filmable."<ref name="Moore Documentary"/>

The first film to be based upon Moore's work was ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' in 2001, which was directed by the [[Hughes Brothers]]. The film made a number of radical differences from the original comic, altering the main character from an older, conservative detective to a young character played by [[Johnny Depp]]. This was followed in 2003 with ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', a film that departed radically from the books, changing the ending from a mob war over the skies of London to the infiltration of a secret base in [[Tibet]]. For these two works, Moore was content to allow the filmmakers to do whatever they wished and removed himself from the process entirely. "As long as I could distance myself by not seeing them," he said, he could profit from the films while leaving the original comics untouched, "assured no one would confuse the two. This was probably naïve on my part."<ref name="Lying in Gutters">{{cite web|last= Johnston|first= Rich |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2153|title= Lying in the Gutters|publisher= [[Comic Book Resources]]|date= 23 May 2005|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140106220427/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=14937|archivedate= 6 January 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=7 January 2006}}</ref> His attitude changed after producer [[Martin Poll]] and screenwriter [[Larry Cohen]] [[Cast of Characters vs. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen lawsuit|filed a lawsuit]] against [[20th Century Fox]], alleging that the film ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' plagiarised an unproduced script they had written entitled ''Cast of Characters''. Although the two scripts bear many similarities, most of them are elements that were added for the film and do not originate in Moore's comics. According to Moore, "They seemed to believe that the head of 20th Century Fox called me up and persuaded me to steal this screenplay, turning it into a comic book they could then adapt back into a movie, to camouflage petty larceny." Moore testified in a deposition, a process he found so unpleasant that he surmised he would have been better treated had he "molested and murdered a busload of retarded children after giving them heroin". Fox's settlement of the case insulted Moore, who interpreted it as an admission of guilt.<ref name="Lying in Gutters"/> In 2012, Moore claimed that he had sold the rights to these two works simply for the money; he did not expect the films ever to be made. He was simply "getting money for old rope". Moore said in an interview in 2012 that he had seen neither film.<ref>{{cite interview |first=Alan |last=Moore |interviewer=Tim Franks | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9711346.stm|title= ''Alan Moore: "Films don't reflect my books"''|program= BBC News – Hardtalk|date= 10 April 2012|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140222142220/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/9711346.stm|archivedate= 22 February 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref>

In 2006, a film adaptation of Moore's ''V for Vendetta'' was released, produced by [[The Wachowskis]] and directed by [[James McTeigue]]. Producer [[Joel Silver]] said at a press conference for the [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[V for Vendetta (film)|V for Vendetta]]'' that fellow producer [[The Wachowskis|Lana Wachowski]] had talked with Moore, and that "[Moore] was very excited about what [Lana] had to say."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newsarama.com/movies/VforPressConf.htm | title=''V for Vendetta's'' Press Conference |publisher=[[Newsarama]]| year=2005 | accessdate=7 January 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012161343/http://newsarama.com/movies/VforPressConf.htm |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}</ref> Moore disputed this, reporting that he told Wachowski "I didn't want anything to do with films&nbsp;... I wasn't interested in Hollywood," and demanded that DC Comics force Warner Bros to issue a public retraction and apology for Silver's "blatant lies". Although Silver called Moore directly to apologise, no public retraction appeared. Moore was quoted as saying that the comic book had been "specifically about things like fascism and anarchy. Those words, 'fascism' and 'anarchy,' occur nowhere in the film. It's been turned into a [[George W. Bush|Bush]]-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/m/moore_alan_060315/ | title=Alan Moore: The Last Angry Man | last=Vineyard | first=Jennifer | work=Movies on MTV.com | publisher=MTV | accessdate=30 December 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222014726/http://www.mtv.com/shared/movies/interviews/m/moore_alan_060315/| archivedate= 22 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> This conflict between Moore and DC Comics was the subject of an article in ''[[The New York Times]]''<ref name="vendettavendetta"/> on 12 March 2006, five days before the US release. In the ''New York Times'' article, Silver stated that about 20&nbsp;years prior to the film's release, he met with Moore and Dave Gibbons when Silver acquired the film rights to ''V For Vendetta'' and ''Watchmen''. Silver stated, "Alan was odd, but he was enthusiastic and encouraging us to do this. I had foolishly thought that he would continue feeling that way today, not realising that he wouldn't." Moore did not deny this meeting or Silver's characterisation of Moore at that meeting, nor did Moore state that he advised Silver of his change of opinion in those approximately 20&nbsp;years. The ''New York Times'' article also interviewed David Lloyd about Moore's reaction to the film's production, stating, "Mr. Lloyd, the illustrator of ''V for Vendetta'', also found it difficult to sympathise with Mr. Moore's protests. When he and Mr. Moore sold their film rights to the comic book, Mr. Lloyd said: "We didn't do it innocently. Neither myself nor Alan thought we were signing it over to a board of trustees who would look after it like it was the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]]."<ref name="vendettavendetta"/>

Moore has subsequently stated that he wishes his name to be removed from all comic work that he does not own, including ''Watchmen'' and ''V for Vendetta'', much as unhappy film directors often choose to have their names removed and be credited as "[[Alan Smithee]]". He also announced that he would not allow his name to be used in any future film adaptations of works he does not own, nor would he accept any money from such adaptations.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/alan_moore_asks_for_an_alan_smithee/ | title=Alan Moore Asks for an Alan Smithee | last=Spurgeon | first=Tom | authorlink=Tom Spurgeon | date=9 November 2005 | work=[[The Comics Reporter]] | accessdate=7 January 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051124004336/http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/alan_moore_asks_for_an_alan_smithee/| archivedate= 24 November 2005 | deadurl= no}}</ref> This request was respected by the producers of the subsequent adaptations of his work ''[[Constantine (film)|Constantine]]'' (2005) (based on a character created by Moore) and ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' (2009), which apart from an adjustment to a finale mechanism stayed remarkably faithful to the graphic novel and had become greatly enabled by the advance in [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and his name was removed from the ''V for Vendetta'' credits.<ref>{{cite web|last= Rossiter|first= Drake|url= http://www.7x7.com/blogs/screen-shots/watchmen-wins-ringing-endorsement-illustrator-dave-gibbons|title= ''Watchmen'' Wins a Ringing Endorsement from Illustrator Dave Gibbons|work=[[7x7 Magazine|7x7 San Francisco]]|date=3 March 2009|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120722185137/http://www.7x7.com/arts/watchmen-wins-ringing-endorsement-illustrator-dave-gibbons|archivedate= 22 July 2012|deadurl= no| accessdate= 21 March 2009}}</ref>

In a 2012, interview with [[LeftLion]] magazine, Alan Moore was asked to put a figure on how much money he had turned down by refusing to be associated with these film adaptations. He estimated it to be 'at least a few million dollars' and said: "You can't buy that kind of empowerment. To just know that as far as you are aware, you have not got a price; that there is not an amount of money large enough to make you compromise even a tiny bit of principle that, as it turned out, would make no practical difference anyway. I'd advise everyone to do it, otherwise you're going to end up mastered by money and that's not a thing you want ruling your life."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.leftlion.co.uk/articles.cfm/title/alan-moore/id/4861/|title= Alan Moore: one of the finest exponents of the comic book art form to have ever lived|first= Jared|last= Wislon|authorlink= Jared Wilson|date= May 2012|publisher= ''[[LeftLion]]''|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120811235311/http://www.leftlion.co.uk/articles.cfm/title/alan-moore/id/4861|archivedate= 11 August 2012|deadurl= yes}}</ref>

==Personal life==
[[File:AlanMoorespeaks at the Commemoration.jpg|thumbnail|right|Alan Moore speaks at the Bradlaugh Commemoration held in Abington Square, Northampton]]
Since his teenage years Moore has had long hair, and since early adulthood has also worn a beard. He has taken to wearing a number of large rings on his hands, leading him to be described as a "cross between [[Hagrid]] and Danny from ''[[Withnail And I]]''" who could be easily mistaken for "the village eccentric".<ref name="Moore's murderer"/> Born and raised in [[Northampton]], he continues to live in the town, and used its history as a basis for his novel ''Voice of the Fire''. His "unassuming terraced" Northampton home was described by an interviewer in 2001 as "something like an occult bookshop under permanent renovation, with records, videos, magical artefacts and comic-book figurines strewn among shelves of mystical tomes and piles of paper. The bathroom, with blue-and-gold décor and a generous sunken tub, is palatial; the rest of the house has possibly never seen a vacuum cleaner. This is clearly a man who spends little time on the material plane."<ref name="Moore's murderer"/> He likes to live in his hometown, feeling that it affords him a level of obscurity that he enjoys, remarking that "I never signed up to be a celebrity."<ref name="Moore Documentary"/> He has spoken in praise of the town's former Radical MP, [[Charles Bradlaugh]] at the [https://charlesbradlaughsociety.wordpress.com/about annual commemoration].

With his first wife Phyllis, whom he married in the early 1970s, he has two daughters, [[Leah Moore|Leah]] and Amber.

===Religion and magic===
In 1993, on his fortieth birthday, Moore openly declared his dedication to being a [[ceremonial magic]]ian, something he saw as "a logical end step to my career as a writer".<ref name="Moore Documentary"/> According to a 2001 interview, his inspiration for doing this came when he was writing ''[[From Hell]]'' in the early 1990s, a book containing much [[Freemasonry|Freemasonic]] and occult symbolism: "One word balloon in ''From Hell'' completely hijacked my life&nbsp;... A character says something like, 'The one place gods inarguably exist is in the human mind'. After I wrote that, I realised I'd accidentally made a true statement, and now I'd have to rearrange my entire life around it. The only thing that seemed to really be appropriate was to become a magician."<ref name="Moore's murderer"/> Moore associates magic very much with writing; "I believe that magic is art, and that art, whether that be music, writing, sculpture, or any other form, is literally magic. Art is, like magic, the science of manipulating symbols, words or images, to achieve changes in consciousness&nbsp;... Indeed to cast a spell is simply to spell, to manipulate words, to change people's consciousness, and this is why I believe that an artist or writer is the closest thing in the contemporary world to a [[shaman]]."<ref name="Moore Documentary"/>

{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#C0C0C0|align=right|quote="[[Monotheism]] is, to me, a great simplification. I mean the Qabalah has a great multiplicity of gods, but at the very top of the Qabalic Tree of Life, you have this one sphere that is absolute God, the [[Monism|Monad]], something which is indivisible. All of the other gods, and indeed everything else in the universe, is a kind of emanation of that God. Now, that's fine, but it's when you suggest that there is only that one God, at this kind of unreachable height above humanity, and there is nothing in between, you're limiting and simplifying the thing. I tend to think of [[paganism]] as a kind of alphabet, as a language, it's like all of the gods are letters in that language. They express nuances, shades of meaning or certain subtleties of ideas, whereas monotheism tends to just be one vowel and it's just something like 'oooooooo'. It's a monkey sound."|source=Alan Moore<ref name="Moore Documentary"/>}}

Connecting his esoteric beliefs with his career in writing, he conceptualised a hypothetical area known as the "Idea Space", describing it as "...&nbsp;a space in which mental events can be said to occur, an idea space which is perhaps universal. Our individual consciousnesses have access to this vast universal space, just as we have individual houses, but the street outside the front door belongs to everybody. It's almost as if ideas are pre-existing forms within this space&nbsp;... The landmasses that might exist in this mind space would be composed entirely of ideas, of concepts, that instead of continents and islands you might have large belief systems, philosophies, [[Marxism]] might be one, [[Judeo-Christian]] religions might make up another." He subsequently believed that to navigate this space, magical systems like the [[tarot]] and the [[Qabalah]] would have to be used.<ref name="Moore Documentary"/>

Taking up the study of the Qabalah and the writings of the notorious early 20th-century occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], Moore accepted ideas from Crowley's religion, [[Thelema]], about [[True Will]] being connected to the will of the [[pantheism|pantheistic]] universe.<ref name="Moore Documentary"/> In some of his earlier magical rituals, he used mind-altering psychedelic drugs but later gave this up, believing that they were unnecessary, and stated, "It's frightening. You call out the names in this strange incomprehensible language, and you're looking into the glass and there appears to be this little man talking to you. It just works."<ref name="Moore's murderer"/>

Moore took as his primary deity the ancient Roman snake god [[Glycon]], who was the centre of a cult founded by a prophet known as [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]], and according to Alexander's critic [[Lucian]], the god itself was merely a puppet, something Moore accepts, considering him to be a "complete hoax",<ref name="Babcock"/><ref name="SLATEDW">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2092739/sidebar/2092745/|title= Sidebar: How Alan Moore transformed American comics|last= Wolk|first= Douglas|authorlink= Douglas Wolk|date= 17 December 2003|publisher= [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate= 10 September 2008|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5ajJOBmav|archivedate= 10 September 2008}}</ref> but dismisses as irrelevant. According to Pagan Studies scholar Ethan Doyle-White, "The very fact that Glycon was probably one big hoax was enough to convince Moore to devote himself to the scaly lord, for, as Moore maintains, the imagination is just as real as reality."<ref name="Doyle-White, Ethan 2009"/>

===Political views===
Moore politically identifies as an [[Anarchism|anarchist]],<ref name="Heidi, pt1"/> and outlined his interpretation of anarchist philosophy, and its application to fiction writing in an interview with Margaret Killjoy, collected in the 2009 book, ''Mythmakers and Lawbreakers'':

{{quote|I believe that all other political states are in fact variations or outgrowths of a basic state of anarchy; after all, when you mention the idea of anarchy to most people they will tell you what a bad idea it is because the biggest gang would just take over. Which is pretty much how I see contemporary society. We live in a badly developed anarchist situation in which the biggest gang has taken over and have declared that it is not an anarchist situation – that it is a capitalist or a communist situation. But I tend to think that anarchy is the most natural form of politics for a human being to actually practice.<ref>{{cite book | last=Killjoy | first=Margaret | others=Robinson, Kim Stanley (Introduction) | title=Mythmakers and Lawbreakers | publisher=[[AK Press]] | location=[[Stirling]], Scotland | date=1 October 2009 | page=42 | isbn=978-1-84935-002-0 | oclc=318877243}}</ref>}}

In December 2011, Moore responded to [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s attack on the [[Occupy movement]], calling his more recent work misogynistic, homophobic and misguided.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.honestpublishing.com/news/the-honest-alan-moore-interview-part-2-the-occupy-movement-frank-miller-and-politics/|title= The Honest Alan Moore Interview – Part 2: The Occupy Movement, Frank Miller, and Politics|date= 2 December 2011|publisher= Honestpublishing.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131106150719/http://www.honestpublishing.com/news/the-honest-alan-moore-interview-part-2-the-occupy-movement-frank-miller-and-politics/|archivedate= 6 November 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 26 April 2013 |quote= Well, Frank Miller is someone whose work I've barely looked at for the past twenty years.

[The Occupy movement] is a completely justified howl of moral outrage and it seems to be handled in a very intelligent, non-violent way, which is probably another reason why Frank Miller would be less than pleased with it. I'm sure if it had been a bunch of young, sociopathic vigilantes with Batman make-up on their faces, he'd be more in favour of it.}}</ref> Worldwide, Occupy protesters have adopted the [[Guy Fawkes mask]] from ''V for Vendetta''.<ref>{{cite web|last= Caron|first= Christina|url= http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2011/11/occupy-protesters-embrace-v-for-vendetta/ | title= Occupy Protesters Embrace ''V for Vendetta''|publisher= [[ABC News]]|date= 4 November 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131109001524/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2011/11/occupy-protesters-embrace-v-for-vendetta/|archivedate= 9 November 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 12 December 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last= Olson|first= Geoff| url= http://commonground.ca/?p=3120|title= Demonstrators don ''V for Vendetta'' masks in Occupy Everywhere|work= [[Common Ground (magazine)|Common Ground]]|location=Canada|date=November 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131109001619/http://commonground.ca/2011/11/demonstrators-don-v-for-vendetta-masks-in-occupy-everywhere/|archivedate= 9 November 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 12 December 2011}}</ref> The mask has also been adopted by [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], [[WikiLeaks]], [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutionaries]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/1723/v-for-vendetta_the-other-face-of-egypts-youth-move|title= ''V for Vendetta'': The Other Face of Egypt's Youth Movement|first= Linda|last= Herrera|date= 30 May 2011|publisher= Jadaliyya.com|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131107022311/http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/1723/v-for-vendetta_the-other-face-of-egypts-youth-move|archivedate= 7 November 2013|deadurl= no}}</ref> and [[anti-globalization]] demonstrators.<ref>{{cite web|last= Lamont|first= Tom|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/nov/27/alan-moore-v-vendetta-mask-protest|title= Alan Moore – meet the man behind the protest mask|work= The Observer|location= UK|date= 26 November 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131205091521/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/27/alan-moore-v-vendetta-mask-protest |archivedate= 5 December 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 12 December 2011}}</ref> Moore described Occupy as "ordinary people reclaiming rights which should always have been theirs"<ref name="Flood">{{cite web|last= Flood|first= Alison| url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/dec/06/alan-moore-frank-miller-row|title= Alan Moore attacks Frank Miller in comic book war of words|work= The Guardian|location= UK|date= 7 December 2011|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131108144744/http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/06/alan-moore-frank-miller-row|archivedate= 8 November 2013|deadurl= no|accessdate= 12 December 2011}}</ref> and added:

I think that the Occupy movement is, in one sense, the public saying that they should be the ones to decide who's too big to fail.

Moore is a member of [[The Arts Emergency Service]], a British charity working with 16- to 19-year-olds in [[further education]] from diverse backgrounds.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.arts-emergency.org/news/whats-the-point-of-arts-and-humanities/|title= What's the point of arts and humanities?|date= n.d.|publisher= Arts-emergency.org|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140405035503/http://www.arts-emergency.org/news/whats-the-point-of-arts-and-humanities/|archivedate= 4 April 2014|deadurl= no}}</ref>

===On conspiracy theories===
Doing research into [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] for his work on ''[[Brought to Light]]'', Moore came to develop his own opinions on the subject of a global conspiracy, stating that "Yes, there is a conspiracy, indeed there are a great number of conspiracies, all tripping each other up&nbsp;... the main thing that I learned about conspiracy theories is that conspiracy theorists actually believe in the conspiracy because that is more comforting. The truth of the world is that it is chaotic. The truth is, that it is not the [[Judeo-Masonic conspiracy theory|Jewish banking conspiracy]], or the [[grey alien]]s, or the twelve-foot [[reptilians|reptiloids]] from another dimension that are in control, the truth is far more frightening; no-one is in control, the world is rudderless."<ref name="Moore Documentary"/>
