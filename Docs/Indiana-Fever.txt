The '''Indiana Fever''' is a professional [[basketball]] team based in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], playing in the [[Eastern Conference (WNBA)|Eastern Conference]] in the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA). The team was founded before the [[2000 WNBA season|inaugural 2000 season]] began. The team is owned by Herb Simon, who also owns the Fever's [[NBA]] counterpart, the [[Indiana Pacers]] and [[Simon Malls]].

The Fever has qualified for the [[WNBA Playoffs]] in twelve of its sixteen years in Indiana. The franchise has been home to many high-quality players such as [[University of Tennessee|Tennessee]] standout [[Tamika Catchings]], hometown favorite [[Katie Douglas]], and [[Australia]]n defensive specialist [[Tully Bevilaqua]]. In [[2009 WNBA Finals|2009]], the Fever went to the [[WNBA Finals]] but fell short to [[Phoenix Mercury|Phoenix]]. On October 21, 2012, the Fever won the WNBA Championship with a win over the [[Minnesota Lynx]]. [[Tamika Catchings]] was named the series MVP.

==Franchise history==

===Catching the Fever (2000–2004)===
[[File:ConsecoFieldhouseLobby.jpg|thumb|left|Lobby of Bankers Life Fieldhouse]]The Indiana Fever team began in 2000, when the state was granted an expansion franchise to coincide with the opening of [[Bankers Life Fieldhouse]] (then Conseco Fieldhouse). In their first two seasons, they were coached by women's basketball legends [[Anne Donovan]] and [[Nell Fortner]]. Led by center [[Kara Wolters]], in their inaugural campaign the team posted a record of 9–23.

The Fever drafted [[University of Tennessee]] star [[Tamika Catchings]] in the 2001 WNBA Draft. The Fever went into the year with high expectations of a playoff berth, but Catchings tore her [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] during a college game and missed the entire WNBA season. The Fever posted a 10–22 record in 2001.

After missing the entire 2001 season, the 2002 season proved to be the breakout season for Tamika Catchings and the Fever. Catchings came out strong and became one of the most versatile players in the WNBA, easily winning [[WNBA Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] honors as well as making the [[WNBA All-Star Game|WNBA All-Star team]]. Her team competed well all year and would post a respectable 16–16 record, tying for the final playoff spot with the [[Orlando Miracle]]. Indiana would win the tiebreaker and earn their first playoff appearance in franchise history. They drew the #1 seed in the playoffs, the [[New York Liberty|Liberty]]; with the Fever losing two games to one.

The 2002–2003 offseason brought a lot of change for the Fever. The team added Olympian [[Natalie Williams]] and [[Charlotte Sting]] star [[Kelly Miller (basketball)|Kelly Miller]] before the 2003 season. During the offseason the original coach and GM Nell Fortner would resign. Kelly Krauskopf would replace Fortner as GM and immediately hire [[Brian Winters]] to be the head coach. On May 29, 2003 the Fever registered their first sellout of 18,345 and defeated the [[Washington Mystics]] on national television. The team would do better under the new coaching, but missed the playoffs, posting a 16–18 record.

The 2004 campaign was very similar to 2003's. The Fever finished with a 15–19 record. They missed the playoffs by one game in the Eastern Conference.

===Heating Up (2005–2007)===
In 2005, the Fever had their best season since joining the league, posting a 21–13 record, and making the playoffs for just the second time. In the first round, the Fever swept the [[New York Liberty]] two games to none, earning their first playoff series victory in franchise history. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Fever faced the heavily favored [[Connecticut Sun]]. Game 1 came down to the final seconds when [[Katie Douglas]] hit a crucial three to win the game for the Sun. Game 2 went into overtime, with the Sun winning, thus sweeping the Fever two games to none.

In the 2005–2006 offseason, the Fever acquired All-Star [[Anna DeForge]] from the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in exchange for [[Kelly Miller (basketball)|Kelly Miller]]. Later that offseason the Fever made another All-Star addition by signing free agent [[Tamika Whitmore]] from the [[Los Angeles Sparks]]. In the [[2006 WNBA Draft]] they selected athletic swing-forward [[La'Tangela Atkinson]] from the [[North Carolina Tar Heels]] along with Kasha Terry from the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets|Yellow Jackets]].

The Fever started the 2006 season off at 4–0 and jumped out to an early lead in the Eastern Conference standings. Teammates [[Tamika Catchings]] and [[Tully Bevilaqua]] led the league in steals, first and second respectively, the first time teammates led the league in one statistical category. The Fever posted a 21–13 record, making the playoffs for the second year in a row. In the first round, the Fever would face arch rival Detroit. Detroit won Game 1 in Indianapolis and held a one-game to nothing lead in the series. Game 2 in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] was a high scoring affair with Tamika Whitmore scoring a WNBA Playoff record 41 points. Detroit won in the end, 98–83 and won the series two games to none.

Going into the 2006–2007 off-season, the Fever looked to improve their post play. In the [[2007 WNBA Draft#Dispersal Draft|Dispersal Draft]], the Fever would add veteran forward [[Sheri Sam]] from the [[Charlotte Sting]]. Kelly Krauskoft and the front office then set their eyes on key Free Agent Center [[Tammy Sutton-Brown]], signing her on March 22, 2007. The Fever would also select 6–7 center [[Alison Bales]] from [[Duke University]] in the [[2007 WNBA Draft]] to go along with Sutton-Brown.

Going into the 2007 season, the Fever had their eyes set on the WNBA Finals. They started off the season strong, winning 16 out of their first 20 games, which was the best 20 game start in history of the Eastern Conference. Then on July 20, key player Tamika Catchings would injure her foot and would miss the rest of the regular season. The injury was later revealed as a partial tear of her [[plantar fascia]]. The Fever would finish 5–9 without Catchings. They managed to win the #2 seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs, beating out the Connecticut Sun. They played the same Sun team in first round of the playoffs. Game 1 in Connecticut was an epic battle, going three overtimes with the Sun hanging on to win Game 1, 93–88. The Fever would win Game 2 at home by double digits forcing a decisive Game 3. In game 3, the Fever would find themselves down by 22 points late halfway through the 3rd quarter. The Fever battled back to win Game 3 in overtime by the same score as Game 1 93–88. The 22-point comeback was the largest comeback in WNBA Playoff history. In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Fever played their other hated rival, the [[Detroit Shock]]. The Fever would grab an early lead in the series, winning Game 1 at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. With the team just 1 game away from the [[WNBA Finals]] the Fever traveled to Detroit. In Game 2, the game would be close until the 2nd quarter, when the Shock would blow the game wide open with a 14–0 run, and would easily win the game. With a spot in the Finals up for grabs in Game 3, the Fever would start off the game with an early 17–3 lead. Then late in the first half Catchings went down with another injury; she had completely torn her [[Achilles tendon]]. The Shock ended up winning Game 3, 85–61.

===Cooling Down (2008)===
On October 26, 2007, the Fever announced that they declined the option for head coach [[Brian Winters]], ending his four-year tenure in charge.<ref name="Winters">{{cite web | url = http://www.wnba.com/fever/news/071026_winters.html | title = Fever Declines Option On Winters Contract  | publisher = FeverBasketball.com | date = 2007-10-26 | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref> He compiled a 78–58 regular season record with a 5–7 playoff record. On December 12, 2007 assistant coach [[Lin Dunn]] was named his successor to the job as head coach.<ref name="Dunn">{{cite web | url = http://www.wnba.com/fever/news/071212_dunn.html | title = Dunn Named Fever’s Fourth Head Coach  | publisher = FeverBasketball.com | date = 2007-12-12 | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

In one of the biggest trades in WNBA history, the Fever traded [[Tamika Whitmore]] and their first-round pick in the [[2008 WNBA Draft]] for [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]] native, [[Katie Douglas]] on February 19, 2008.<ref name="Douglas">{{cite web | url = http://www.wnba.com/fever/news/080219_douglastrade.html | title = Fever Acquires Hometown Star Katie Douglas In Trade With Connecticut  | publisher = FeverBasketball.com | date = 2008-02-19 | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref>

The Fever were part of the [[Liberty Outdoor Classic]], which was the first regular-season professional basketball game played outdoors. It was played between the Fever and [[New York Liberty]] at [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] in [[Flushing, New York]] on July 19, 2008 with the Fever winning the game, 71–55.

During the 2008 season, the Fever struggled in comparison to the three previous seasons. They finished with a 17–17 record, good for fourth place in the playoffs. Meeting the [[Detroit Shock]] in the first round, the Fever lost in three games.

===Feeling the Fever (2009–2012)===
After a disappointing 2008 season, the Fever were looking to improve in 2009. [[Indiana Pacers]] owners had said the Fever have been losing money. Perhaps the only thing to save the Fever from folding in the near future, the owners inferred, was for the Fever to be successful on the court and at the box office. The Fever took the owners' ultimatum to heart and reached the playoffs as the first seed overall in the Eastern Conference with a franchise best record of 22–12. In the first round, the Fever ousted the [[Washington Mystics]] in a sweep, marking their return to the conference finals. In the East finals, again facing their rival [[Detroit Shock]], they reached their first ever [[WNBA Finals]] by defeating the Shock in three games. The Fever then lost in 5 games to the [[Phoenix Mercury]] in the [[WNBA Finals]].

Because of the success in 2009, the Fever announced they would remain in [[Indianapolis]] for 2010. Their 2011 season in Indianapolis was also confirmed as well.

In 2012, the Fever advanced to the 2012 WNBA Finals. Indiana then defeated the [[Minnesota Lynx]], 3 games to 1. It was the Fever's first WNBA title.

===Continuing the Reign  (2012–present)===
After the Fever won the 2012 WNBA championship, the ownership group took notice of their management – by promoting general manager Kelly Krauskopf to president of the franchise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wnba.com/fever/news/kelly_krauskopf_promoted_president.html |title=FEVER: Kelly Krauskopf Promoted to President |publisher=Wnba.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref> Krauskopf has been giving additional duites within the franchise as well as a pay increase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/8572656/kelly-krauskopf-promoted-president-indiana-fever |title=Kelly Krauskopf promoted to president of Indiana Fever – ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2012-10-30 |accessdate=2013-03-22}}</ref>

*2011–2012: As part of the move to [[Adidas]]'s Revolution 30 technology, the Fever made subtle changes to the uniforms. Home uniforms remain white, but the 'Fever' wordmark is now written in navy with red and yellow trim. Numbers are now rounded and in red. Away uniforms remain unchanged save for the striping patterns and rounded numbers. 
*2013–2015: On October 19, 2012, the Fever announced that [[Finish Line, Inc.|Finish Line]] will be their uniform sponsor, beginning with the [[2013 WNBA season|2013 season]]. The uniform stayed the same aside from a new number scheme and the addition of the uniform sponsor.
*2016: As part of a league-wide initiative for its 20th season, all games featured all-color uniform matchups. Therefore, the Fever unveiled a yellow jersey as a light-colored uniform to complement its standard navy uniform.

==Media coverage==
Currently, some Fever games are broadcast on [[Fox Sports Indiana]] (FS-I), which is a local television station for the state of [[Indiana]]. More often than not, [[NBA TV]] will pick up the feed from the local broadcast, which is shown nationally. Broadcasters for the Fever games are Debbie Antonelli and [[Chris Denari]].

Games are radio broadcast locally on [[WFNI]] in which Denari and Kevin Lee act as announcers.

All games (excluding blackout games, which are available on [[ESPN3.com]]) are broadcast to the [[WNBA LiveAccess]] game feeds on the league website. Furthermore, some Fever games are broadcast nationally on [[ESPN]], [[WNBA on ESPN|ESPN2]] and [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]. The [[WNBA]] has reached an eight-year agreement with [[ESPN]], which will pay right fees to the Fever, as well as other teams in the league.<ref>{{cite news |work=Sports Business |title=WNBA Extends TV Rights Deal with ESPN and ABC |date=June 18, 2007 |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/162162/wnba-extends-tv-rights-deal-with-espn-and-abc |accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref>
