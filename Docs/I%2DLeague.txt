The '''I-League''', officially known as the '''[[Hero MotoCorp|Hero]] I League''' due to sponsorship reasons, is an Indian professional league for men's [[association football]] clubs. Contested by 9 clubs (currently), it operates on a system of [[promotion and relegation]] with the [[I-League 2nd Division]] as well as a system of [[Expansion team|direct-entry]].

Seasons run from January to May, with teams playing 18 matches each, totalling 90 matches in the season.<ref>{{cite web|title=India - I-League (2013 - 2014)|url=http://tipsterarea.com/match/dempo-goa-mumbai-fc-india-i-league-328258|work=Tipster Area|accessdate=25 April 2014}}</ref> Most games are usually played in the afternoons during the weekends or midweeks. It is currently sponsored by [[Hero MotoCorp|Hero]].

The competition, formed as the '''[[ONGC]] I-League''' in 2007 in an effort to professionalize the game in India after holding the old [[National Football League (India)|National Football League]] for eleven seasons, replaced the NFL as the primary competition in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Event Information |url=http://www.the-aiff.com/pages/tournament/tournament-event.php?tournamentdetail=15 |work=The All India Football Federation |accessdate=25 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603221459/http://www.the-aiff.com/pages/tournament/tournament-event.php?tournamentdetail=15 |archivedate=3 June 2012 }}</ref> The league's first official broadcaster was [[TEN Action|Zee Sports]].<ref name="Television Point">{{cite web|last=Khurana |first=Ashish |title=Zee Sports, AIFF ready with ONGC I-League |url=http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2007/print.php?id=1195724736 |work=Televisionpoint.com |accessdate=25 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322125703/http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2007/print.php?id=1195724736 |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}</ref> The first goal for the league was to have 16 teams by the third season, by which the league would be spread all around India.<ref name="Television Point"/>

Since the league inception, a total of five clubs have been crowned [[List of Indian football champions|champions]] of the I-League. Of the 25 clubs to have competed since the inception of the I-League in 2007, the teams that have won the title are [[Mohun Bagan A.C.]] (once), [[Bengaluru FC]] (twice), [[Churchill Brothers S.C.|Churchill Brothers]] (twice), [[Dempo S.C.|Dempo]] (thrice), and [[Salgaocar F.C.|Salgaocar]] (once) respectively. The title has only been won thrice by a team from outside of the state of [[Goa]] with the first six of eight editions of the league being won by Goan sides. The current champions of the I-League are [[Bengaluru FC]], who won their second league title in three years.

It was revealed by AIFF on May 17, 2016 that from 2017-18 season, the league will be called '''League One''' and will be the second tier of India's new football structure.<ref name="newstructure">{{cite news|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/7083/isl/2016/05/17/23620432/indian-football-roadmap-for-future-of-indian-super-league|title=Indian football: Roadmap for future of Indian Super League and I-League explained|publisher=goal.com|date=17 May 2016|accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref> The top tier of Indian football will be [[Indian Super League|ISL]].

==History==

===Origins===
In 1996 the first domestic league was started in India known as the [[National Football League (India)|National Football League]].<ref name=GoldenTimes>{{cite web|title=Indian National League (I-League) 2011-12 Season Review|url=http://www.goaldentimes.org/indian-national-league-i-league-2011-12-season-review/|website=Goalden Times|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> The league was started in an effort to introduce professionalism to Indian football.<ref name=GoldenTimes/> Despite that ambition, that has never been achieved. During the National Football League days the league suffered from poor infrastructure and unprofessionalism from its clubs. One of the clubs in the league, [[FC Kochin]] went defunct in 2002 after it was revealed that the club had not paid salaries since 2000 after running up 2.5 crores in losses a season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Radhakrishnan|first1=M.G.|title=The final whistle|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/first-indian-professional-football-club-fc-kochin-faces-closure-as-players-migrate/1/219886.html|website=India Today|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>

After a decade of decline with the National Football League, the [[All India Football Federation]] decided it was time for a change and rebranding of the top-tier in India.<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://ileague.in/history/|website=ileague.in|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>

===Formation===
After the [[2006–07 Indian National Football League|2006–07]] NFL season, it was announced that the [[National Football League (India)|National Football League]] would be relaunched and rebranded as the I-League for the 2007–08 season.<ref name="I-League relaunched">{{cite web|title=AIFF's I-League to have 10 teams|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/2007/nov/21aiff.htm|website=Rediff|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> The league's first season consisted of eight teams from the previous NFL campaign and two teams from the 2nd Division to form a 10 team league.<ref name="I-League relaunched"/> [[Oil and Natural Gas Corporation]] (ONGC), the title sponsors of the previous NFL, were named as the title sponsors of the I-League before the league kicked-off in November 2007.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Amin-ul Islam|first1=Mohammad|title=I-League partners ONGC cry foul|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/I-League-partners-ONGC-cry-foul/articleshow/2579593.cms|website=Times of India|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> The league also announced a changed in their foreign-player restrictions with the new rule being that all the clubs could sign four foreigners – three non-Asian and one which must be Asian.<ref>{{cite web|title=I-League Clubs have Too Many Foreigners: Bhutia|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/news/article/ILeague-Clubs-have-Too-Many-Foreigners-Bhutia/668120|website=Outlook India|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> The league also announced that, for the first season, matches will be broadcast on [[TEN Action|Zee Sports]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Zee Sports, AIFF ready with ONGC I-League |url=http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2007/print.php?id=1195724736 |website=Televisionpoint |accessdate=11 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322125703/http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2007/print.php?id=1195724736 |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}</ref>

The original ten clubs in the I-League's first season were [[Air India FC|Air India]], [[Churchill Brothers S.C.|Churchill Brothers]], [[Dempo S.C.|Dempo]], [[East Bengal F.C.|East Bengal]], [[JCT FC|JCT]], [[Mahindra United]], [[Mohun Bagan A.C.|Mohun Bagan]], [[Salgaocar F.C.|Salgaocar]], [[Sporting Clube de Goa|Sporting Goa]], and [[Chirag United Club Kerala|Viva Kerala]].

The first ever I-League match took place on 24 November 2007 between [[Dempo S.C.|Dempo]] and [[Salgaocar F.C.|Salgaocar]]. The match, which took place at the [[Fatorda Stadium]] in [[Margao]], ended 3–0 in favour of Dempo with [[Chidi Edeh]] scoring the first ever goal in league history in the third minute.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dempo beat Salgaocar 3-0 with Chidi's brace|url=http://news.oneindia.in/2007/11/24/dempo-beat-salgaocar-3-0-with-chidis-brace-1195916716.html|website=ONE India|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> After eighteen rounds it was Dempo who came out as the first ever champions in the I-League.<ref name="Hindu Dempo Champions 2007">{{cite web|title=Dempo SC is I-League champion|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/dempo-sc-is-ileague-champion/article3336931.ece|website=The Hindu|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> [[Chirag United Club Kerala|Viva Kerala]] and Salgaocar, however, ended up as the first two teams to ever be relegated from the I-League.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salgaocar, Viva Kerala relegated from I-League|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/sports/salgaocar-viva-kerala-relegated-from-i-league_10018495.html|website=Tha Indian|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref>

The next season the I-League was expanded from 10 to 12 teams. [[Mumbai F.C.|Mumbai]], [[United S.C.|Chirag United]], [[Mohammedan S.C. (Kolkata)|Mohammedan]], and [[Vasco S.C.|Vasco]] were all promoted from the [[I-League 2nd Division]] to make the expansion possible.<ref name="ILeague National Tournament">{{cite web|last1=Rajan|first1=P Sujesh|title=Is the I-League a national tournament?|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/is-the-ileague-a-national-tournament-/364621/|website=Indian Express|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> This however brought up early concerns over how "national" the I-League was. The [[2008–09 I-League|2008–09]] season would see eleven of the twelve teams come from three different cities. The previous season saw all ten teams come from four different cities.<ref name="ILeague National Tournament"/> [[Baichung Bhutia]], then captain of the [[India national football team|Indian national team]], said that it was the [[All India Football Federation|federations]] job to spread the game across the country and that it needed to happen.<ref name="ILeague National Tournament"/>

Regardless of the early criticism, the I-League went on as scheduled and once the 2008–09 season concluded it was [[Churchill Brothers S.C.|Churchill Brothers]] who came out on top.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Brothers outlast their elders|url=http://www.foxsportspulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?c=0-996-0-0-0&sID=12633&articleID=8880625&news_task=DETAIL|website=FOX Sports|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> Then, before the [[2009–10 I-League|2009–10]] season, the league was once again expanded from 12 teams to 14. In order to make this happen Salgaocar, Viva Kerala, [[Pune F.C.|Pune]], and [[Shillong Lajong F.C.|Shillong Lajong]] were all promoted from the 2nd Division to the I-League.<ref name="Telegraph India Nationals">{{cite web|title=Shillong’s Lajong FC defy odds|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1090419/jsp/sports/story_10842811.jsp|website=Telegraph India|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> This helped the I-League retain some criticism about how national the league was as now the league would be played in seven different cities/states: [[Goa]], [[Kerala]], [[Kolkata]], [[Mumbai]], [[Pune]], [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]], and [[Shillong]].<ref name="Telegraph India Nationals"/>

After the 2009–10 season it was Dempo who came out on top for the second time in I-League history.<ref name="Hindu Dempo Champions 2007"/>

===2010–present===

====Conflict of parties====
On 9 December 2010 the [[All India Football Federation]] signed a 15-year, 700-crore deal with [[Reliance Industries]] and [[IMG (company)|International Management Group]] of the United States.<ref name="IMG Deal 2010">{{cite web|title=AIFF signs 700-crore deal with IMG-RIL|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/AIFF-signs-700-crore-deal-with-IMG-RIL/articleshow/7072492.cms?referral=PM|website=Times of India|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> The deal gave IMG-Reliance exclusive commercial rights to sponsorship, advertising, broadcasting, merchandising, video, franchising, and rights to create a new football league.<ref name="IMG Deal 2010"/> This deal came about after the AIFF ended their 10-year deal with [[TEN Action|Zee Sports]] five years early back in October 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=AIFF approaches Jindal, Videocon to sponsor I-League|url=http://topnews.in/sports/aiff-approaches-jindal-videocon-sponsor-i-league-214114|website=Top News|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref>

Two months later, on 8 February 2011, it was reported that twelve of the fourteen I-League clubs held a private meeting in [[Mumbai]] to discuss the ongoing issues related to the league.<ref name="Owners Meeting February 2011">{{cite web|last1=Sengupta|first1=Somnath|title=Indian Football : BREAKING NEWS (8th February, 2012) : I-League Clubs On War Path With AIFF?|url=http://www.thehardtackle.com/2012/indian-football-breaking-news-8th-february-2012-i-league-clubs-on-war-path-with-aiff/|website=The Hard Tackle|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> It was never revealed what was exactly talked about at this meeting.<ref name="Owners Meeting February 2011"/> Then, on 22 February, it was announced that the same twelve I-League clubs that attended the meeting would not be signing the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]]–licensing papers needed to play in the I-League.<ref name="TOI Clubs Refuse">{{cite web|title=I-League clubs refuse to accept AIFF diktat|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/i-league/I-League-clubs-refuse-to-accept-AIFF-diktat/articleshow/11982740.cms|website=Times of India|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> The reasoning for this was because the I-League clubs were not happy over the fact that IMG-Reliance had so far done nothing to promote the I-League and that they demanded the I-League be made a separate entity from both the AIFF and IMG-Reliance.<ref name="TOI Clubs Refuse"/> At this time however there were rumours that IMG-Reliance had been planning on revamping the I-League along the same lines as [[Major League Soccer]] of the United States for the 2012–13 season.<ref name="TOI Clubs Refuse"/>

On 11 March 2012, following the disbanding of two former I-League clubs – [[JCT FC|JCT]] and [[Mahindra United]], it was announced that the I-League clubs would be forming their own organization known as the ''Indian Professional Football Clubs Association'' (IPFCA) in order to safeguard their interest and promote football in India.<ref name="Hindu March 2012">{{cite web|title=I-League club owners press for sustainable revenue model|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/article2982415.ece|website=The Hindu|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> Every club, except for [[HAL SC|HAL]] and AIFF–owned [[Pailan Arrows]], joined the newly formed organization.<ref name="Hindu March 2012"/> Soon after, it was announced that there would be a meeting held between the AIFF, IMG-Reliance, and the IPFCA on 20 April 2012. In this meeting, IMG-Reliance would present their plan on how they would grow the I-League but the meeting never occurred for reasons unknown.<ref name="AIFF IPFCA Non-Meeting">{{cite web|last1=Bali|first1=Rahul|title=AIFF and IMG-Reliance’s ‘Slack’ behaviour results in no plan on Indian football being presented|url=http://m.goal.com/s/en-india/news/3059078|website=Goal.com|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref>

Then, on 4 May 2012, the AIFF hosted the last ad hoc meeting – an annual meeting between the [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] and AIFF to assess the growth of Indian football. The AFC president at the time, [[Zhang Jilong]], was also in attendance at this meeting.<ref name="IPFCA Ad hoc">{{cite web|last1=Bali|first1=Rahul|title=AFC president Zhang Jilong greeted with I-League clubs’ absence|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/136/india/2012/05/05/3081509/afc-president-zhang-jilong-greeted-with-i-league-clubs|website=Goal.com|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref> It was reported that the IPFCA would use this meeting to voice their displeasure at the AIFF and IMG-Reliance but the association never showed up at the meeting.<ref name="IPFCA Ad hoc"/>

On 18 June 2012 the IPFCA was officially sanctioned under the Society's Act of 1960.<ref name="IPFCA Society">{{cite web|title=IPFCA office bearers nominated|url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/football/ipfca-office-bearers-nominated/|website=SportsKeeda|accessdate=14 July 2014}}</ref>

====League improvement====
Despite the ongoing war between the AIFF, IMG-Reliance, and the IPFCA, the league did manage to improve its product on the field and awareness did increase during this period. It all started when the [[India national football team|India national team]] participated in the [[AFC Asian Cup]] in [[2011 AFC Asian Cup|2011]] for the first time in 27 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=After 27 years, India bids to make mark on Asian Cup|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/595840/after-27-years-india-bids-to-make-mark-on-asian-cup|website=Dawn|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> Despite being knocked-out in the group stage after losing all three of their games, India came back home more popular than ever. [[Subrata Pal]], of [[Pune F.C.|Pune]] gained the most popularity after his impressive performances in goal for India during the Asian Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=Subrata Pal the spiderman on trial in Germany|url=http://www.indianfootballnetwork.com/blog/2012/07/17/subrata-pal-the-spiderman-on-trial-in-germany/|website=Indian Football Network|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> At the same time, before the Asian Cup, [[Sunil Chhetri]] became the second Indian footballer in the modern footballing era to move abroad when he signed for the [[Sporting Kansas City|Kansas City Wizards]] in [[Major League Soccer]] in 2010. He also became the first exported Indian from the I-League.<ref>{{cite web|title=KC Wizards sign Sunil Chhetri – will be first Indian player to play in MLS|url=http://theoriginalwinger.com/2010-03-26-kc-wizards-sign-sunil-chhetri-will-be-first-indian-player-to-play-in-mls|website=The Original Winger|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>

The league was then given a major boost from its main derby, the [[Kolkata derby]], between [[East Bengal F.C.|East Bengal]] and [[Mohun Bagan A.C.|Mohun Bagan]]. On 20 November 2011, 90,000 people watched at the [[Salt Lake Stadium]] as Mohun Bagan defeated East Bengal 1–0.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ghoshal|first1=Amoy|title=Mohun Bagan 1-0 East Bengal – Marines Go Second As Trevor Morgan Suffers First Derby Defeat|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/match/mohun-bagan-vs-east-bengal/1215860/report|website=Goal.com|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> The league also saw more expansion to others areas with the promotion of [[United Sikkim F.C.|United Sikkim]] from the 2nd Division,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mangar|first1=Nirmal|title=United Sikkim enters I-League  - Draw for Bhaichung boys|url=http://www.samachar.com/united-sikkim-enters-i-league-meseLqghgfc.html|website=Samachar|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> however, their reign was short lived as financial troubles saw them relegated the next season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Srivastava|first1=Ayush|title=Club management to blame for United Sikkim's relegation|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/1064/i-league/2013/04/22/3921495/club-management-to-blame-for-united-sikkims-relegation|website=Goal.com|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>

Meanwhile, while the league continued to grow, so did the players demand. During this period plenty of Indian players were wanted on trial by foreign clubs, mainly in Europe. After his return from MLS, Sunil Chhetri and international teammate [[Jeje Lalpekhlua]] were called for trials at [[Scottish Premier League]] side [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jeje Lalpekhlua, Sunil Chhetri at Glasgow Rangers|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/Jeje-Lalpekhlua-Sunil-Chhetri-at-Glasgow-Rangers/articleshow/10886660.cms|website=Times of India|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> Subrata Pal had trials at [[RB Leipzig]] before finally signing for [[FC Vestsjælland|Vestsjælland]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Subrata Paul signs 6-month contract with FC Vikings|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/Subrata-Paul-signs-6-month-contract-with-FC-Vikings/articleshow/29618387.cms|website=Times of India|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> And [[Gurpreet Singh Sandhu]] underwent trials at then [[Premier League]] side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gurpreet Singh Sandhu set for a trial cum training stint with Wigan Athletic|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/136/india/2012/07/15/3243610/gurpreet-singh-sandhu-set-for-a-trial-cum-training-stint|website=Goal.com|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>

At the same time, as Indian players demand abroad increased, the demand for higher quality foreigners in the I-League also increased. Former [[A-League]] player of the year and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rican]] international [[Carlos Hernández (footballer)|Carlos Hernández]] signed with [[United S.C.|Prayag United]] before the [[2012–13 I-League|2012–13]] season from the [[Melbourne Victory FC|Melbourne Victory]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Carlos signs one year deal with Prayag United|url=http://www.indiansportsnews.com/top-stories/15302-carlos-signs-one-year-deal-with-prayag.html|website=Indian Sports News|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanese]] international [[Bilal Najjarine]] also signed with [[Churchill Brothers S.C.|Churchill Brothers]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Srivastava|first1=Ayush|title=Lebanese defender Bilal Najjarin leaves Churchill Brothers|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/1064/i-league/2013/01/24/3697682/lebanese-defender-bilal-najjarin-leaves-churchill-brothers|website=Goal.com|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref>

==Competition format==

===Competition===
Since the league began in 2007 the rules of the league have changed almost yearly. Currently the league has 11 teams but the previous season there were 13 clubs in the I-League. Each club played each other twice during the season, once at home and the other away from home. The team that wins a match receives three points while both teams gain one point if they draw. A loser is not awarded any points. At the end of the season, the team with the most points wins the league.<ref>{{cite web|title=2013-14 Regulations|url=http://www.the-aiff.com/downloaddocumentlibrary.php?id=46|website=The All India Football Federation|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>

===AFC qualification===
Clubs from the I-League primarily participate internationally in the [[AFC Cup]], however, some I-League clubs have had the chance to qualify for the [[AFC Champions League]]. From 2007 to 2011 the champions of the previous season of the I-League were allowed to play in a qualifier for the Champions League.<ref>{{cite web|title=India Gets AFC Champions League Slot|url=http://i-league.org/?p=9546|website=I-League|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> Then from 2011 to 2013 no I-League club played in a qualifier till [[Pune F.C.|Pune]] in 2014 after the club passed the AFC Licensing Criteria.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sarmah|first1=Bhargab|title=Pune FC In AFC Champions League, Club World Cup Bid, U19 I-League And Other Things To Watch Out For In 2014|url=http://www.thehardtackle.com/2014/pune-fc-in-afc-champions-league-club-world-cup-u19-i-league-and-other-things-to-watch-out-for-in-2014/|website=The Hard Tackle|accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref> However, to this day, no I-League has actually qualified for the AFC Champions League.

==Media coverage==

===India===
Since 2007 the I-League has managed to find a way to be telecast, which is drastic in increasing the profile and popularity of the league. Before the inaugural [[2007–08 I-League|2007–08]] season the [[All India Football Federation]] reached a deal with [[TEN Action|Zee Sports]] to broadcast 45 of the 90 matches that season with [[TEN Sports]] broadcasting 15 matches in the inaugural season.<ref name=HinduTelevision>{{cite web|title=I-League kicks off on Nov. 24|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/22/stories/2007112263001900.htm|website=The Hindu|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> The deal with Zee Sports was a continuation of the 10-year deal reached between the AIFF and Zee Sports in 2005.<ref name="Ten Year Deal">{{cite web|last1=Bali|first1=Rahul|title=Zee Sports Wants A Review In The 10 Year Deal With The AIFF|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/1064/i-league/2009/10/16/1563971/zee-sports-wants-a-review-in-the-10-year-deal-with-the-aiff|website=Goal.com|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> However, in October 2009, Zee Sports reportedly sent a letter to the AIFF asking for the federation to review the 10-year contract after concerns were raised by the broadcaster that the league was not attracting as many sponsors as they would have liked.<ref name="Ten Year Deal"/> In August 2010 it was revealed that there were crunch talks between the AIFF and Zee Sports over these concerns and that there was a provision in the 10-year deal that said it could be reviewed after the first five years.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bali|first1=Rahul|title=I-League: AIFF And Zee Sports Still Locked In Reviewing Their Contract As The Friendly Games And I-League Lurk|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/1064/i-league/2010/08/05/2056547/i-league-aiff-and-zee-sports-still-locked-in-reviewing-their|website=Goal.com|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref>

Then, in October 2010, it was revealed that the AIFF had decided to terminate the 10-year deal with Zee Sports five months early.<ref name="Zee Compensation">{{cite web|title=Zee demands Rs70 crore compensation from AIFF|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/zee-demands-rs70-crore-compensation-from-aiff/702994/|website=Indian Express|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> It was also announced that the AIFF had lined up [[IMG (company)|IMG]]-[[Reliance Industries|Reliance]] as the new marketing rights partner of the league and [[India national football team|national team]].<ref name="Zee Compensation"/> It was also announced that Zee Sports would want Rs. 70 crore in compensation for the AIFF terminating the previous 10-year contract.<ref name="Zee Compensation"/> The deal with IMG-Reliance was officially announced on 9 December 2010.<ref name="IMG Deal">{{cite web|title=AIFF signs 700-crore deal with IMG-RIL|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/AIFF-signs-700-crore-deal-with-IMG-RIL/articleshow/7072492.cms|website=Times of India|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> Through this agreement, IMG-Reliance were given exclusive rights to sponsorship, advertising, broadcasting, merchandising, film, video and data, intellectual property, franchising and new league rights.<ref name="IMG Deal"/> However, despite this agreement, the [[2010–11 I-League|2010–11]] season went without any broadcasting partner nationally.<ref>{{cite web|title=I-League kicks off without title sponsor, TV coverage|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/117432/content/213868/we-have-comments-tool.html|website=Deccan Herald|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> The AIFF did start to invite proposals however for a new telecast broadcaster but it would only be for the 2010–11 season. It was ten announced on 3 February 2010 that local Bengali channel, [[Mahuaa Bangla]], would be the one and only broadcaster of the league for the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chaudhuri|first1=Arunava|title=Bengali TV channel Mahua Bangla to show I-League|url=http://www.sportskeeda.com/football/bengali-tv-channel-mahua-bangla-to-show-i-league/|website=SportsKeeda|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref>

In September 2010, after the disaster that was the 2010–11 season for television in the I-League, it was announced that the AIFF and IMG-Reliance had reached an agreement with local broadcasters ''Brand Value Communications'' to have games shown locally on [[News Time]] in West Bengal and Assam for one season.<ref>{{cite web|title=I-League: Regional Broadcast partner announced|url=http://arunfoot.blogspot.com/2011/09/i-league-regional-broadcast-partner.html|website=Arunfoot|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> However, in October 2011, it was announced that a deal with national broadcaster had been found and that was with [[TEN Action]] for one season.<ref name="TEN Action 2011">{{cite web|title=I-League 2011-12: Exciting Times Ahead|url=http://www.thehardtackle.com/2011/i-league-2011-12-exciting-times-ahead/|website=The Hard Tackle|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref> The deal included 75 matches for the [[2011–12 I-League|2011–12]] season.<ref name="TEN Action 2011"/>

==Criticisms==

===Financial situation===
One of the major criticisms of the I-League has been the league's continuing financial instability.<ref name="THT Financial Trouble">{{cite web|last1=Sengupta|first1=Somnath|title=Indian Club Football: How Financially Sustainable Is Football In India?|url=http://www.thehardtackle.com/2011/indian-club-football-how-financially-sustainable-is-football-in-india/|website=The Hard Tackle|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> Since the league began in 2007 the league has seen four clubs disband their operations – [[Chirag United Club Kerala|Chirag United Kerala]], [[JCT FC|JCT]], [[Mahindra United]], and [[Pailan Arrows]].<ref name="TOI Pailan Disbands">{{cite web|last1=Ganguly|first1=Abhishek|title=AIFF disbands Pailan Arrows outfit|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/i-league/AIFF-disbands-Pailan-Arrows-outfit/articleshow/22149611.cms|website=Times of India|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref><ref name="THT Chirag Kerala Disband">{{cite web|last1=Ajgoankar|first1=Ashlesh|title=Indian Football: Can Kerala Produce Next I.M.

This is mainly due to the fact that clubs in the I-League do not rely on income from merchandise sales or ticket sales and that television revenue goes directly to the [[All India Football Federation]] instead of the clubs.<ref name="THT Financial Trouble"/>

Currently attendance in the I-League is suffering as the [[2013–14 I-League|2013–14]] season only averaged 5,618 per game.<ref name="I-League attendance">{{cite web|title=I-League 13/14: Avg Spectators Of Clubs|url=http://i-league.org/?p=13557|website=I-League|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref> [[Mohun Bagan A.C.|Mohun Bagan]] averaged the most spectators that season with an average of 17,068 while [[Shillong Lajong F.C.|Shillong Lajong]] ended up being the only other I-League club to finish with an average attendance over 10,000 when the finished at 11,308 per game.<ref name="I-League attendance"/> Part of the reason for these attendances other than the lack of marketing has been cited as being the fact that most I-League matches start in the afternoon when it is way too hot for fans than during the night.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Malhotra|first1=Kratik|title=Fanview: Have Your Say - Would You Prefer Watching I-League Matches At The Cooperage Ground In The Afternoon Or Evening?|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/2292/editorials/2011/06/12/2528478/fanview-have-your-say-would-you-prefer-watching-i-league-matches-|website=Goal.com|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>

===Institutional football===
Most football clubs in India are what are termed ''Institutional'' teams.<ref name=THTInstitutionalPart1>{{cite web|last=Sengupta|first=Somnath|title=Institutional Sides in Indian Football : Future Uncertain ? (Part-1)|url=http://www.thehardtackle.com/2011/institutional-sides-in-indian-football-future-uncertain-part-1/|work=The Hard Tackle|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref> That means it is difficult for players or coaches to turn into complete professionals.<ref name=THTInstitutionalPart1/> The players who play for institutional teams would also work on a full-time job outside of the game for his company the team was sponsored by.<ref name=THTInstitutionalPart1/> This is much the same model which was found in Japan before the introduction of the [[J. League]].<ref name=Soccerphile>{{cite web|last=Hood|first=Christopher|title=History of Japanese Football|url=http://www.soccerphile.com/soccerphile/archives/wc2002/fo/co/jf.html|work=Soccerphile|accessdate=19 July 2012}}</ref> The positives are that the teams are usually well resourced with players earning decent money and the prospect of employment after their footballing days finish.<ref name=THTInstitutionalPart1/> On the negative side, teams only represent a few thousand workers rather than whole cities and thus do not gain broad support.<ref name=THTInstitutionalPart1/>

On 21 February 2014 it was officially announced that the two remaining institutional clubs in the I-League – [[Air India FC|Air India]] and [[ONGC F.C.|ONGC]] – had been expelled from the I-League and that all other institutional clubs would not be allowed to participate in the league.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Noronha|first1=Anselm|title=Air India and ONGC FC officially out of next season's I-League - report|url=http://www.goal.com/en-india/news/1064/i-league/2013/02/21/3767975/air-india-and-ongc-fc-officially-out-of-next-seasons-i|website=Goal.com|accessdate=11 July 2014}}</ref>

==Head coaches==
<!--{{See also|List of I-League head coaches}}-->

The role of the head coach in the I-League varies from club to club. Some clubs in the I-League like to appoint technical directors as well as head coaches and the technical directors for the most part are given the power the select the squad and sometimes the entire team management.<ref name="AIFF Strict TDs">{{cite web|title=AIFF is set to act strict|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140509/jsp/sports/story_18323654.jsp#.U7BZY41dUU8|website=Telegraph India|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref> The [[All India Football Federation]] does impose licensing requirements for head coaches in the I-League, the rule being that the head coach must have an AFC A-License in order to coach in the I-League, however, some clubs and coaches like [[Subhash Bhowmick]], [[Subrata Bhattacharya (footballer)|Subrata Bhattacharya]], [[Sukhwinder Singh (football coach)|Sukhwinder Singh]], and [[Bimal Ghosh]] are known for accepting a technical directors role in order to bypass the head coaching requirements without an A-License.<ref name="AIFF Strict TDs"/> This has bought about a lot of controversial news in the I-League, most recently being when [[Churchill Brothers S.C.|Churchill Brothers]] won the I-League after the [[2012–13 I-League|2012–13]] season with Subhash Bhowmick running the entire team on and off the field but not winning the "Coach of the Year" award due to being listed as the technical director and not the head coach.<ref name="AIFF Strict TDs"/>

Seeing this, the AIFF technical director, [[Rob Baan]], as well as others, advocated that the federation make it mandatory for both technical directors and head coaches to have an AFC A-License.<ref name="AIFF Strict TDs"/> On 14 May 2014 this was officially put into act by the AIFF during their I-League licensing committee meeting.<ref>{{cite web|title=A-Licence degree must for technical directors: AIFF|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/A-Licence-degree-must-for-technical-directors-AIFF/articleshow/35120576.cms|website=Times of India|accessdate=29 June 2014}}</ref>

In terms of coaching performance, after the first seven seasons of the I-League, an Indian head coach has won the I-League four times while a foreign head coach has won it three times.
