'''''Home and Away''''' is an Australian television [[soap opera]]. It was created by Alan Bateman and commenced broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] on 17 January 1988. Bateman came up with the concept of the show during a trip to [[Kangaroo Point, New South Wales]],  where he noticed locals were complaining about the construction of a foster home and against the idea of foster children from the city living in the area. The soap opera was initially going to be called ''Refuge'', but the name was changed to the "friendlier" title of ''Home and Away'' once production began.  The show premiered with a ninety-minute pilot episode (subsequently in re-runs known as ''Home and Away: The Movie''). Since then, each subsequent episode has aired for a duration of twenty-two minutes and ''Home and Away'' has become the second-longest drama series in Australian television. In Australia, it is currently broadcast from Mondays to Thursdays at 7:00 pm (on Thursdays, two episodes are played in a one-hour block).

''Home and Away'' follows the lives and loves of the residents in [[Summer Bay]], a fictional seaside town of [[New South Wales]]. The series initially focused on the Fletcher family – [[Tom Fletcher (Home and Away)|Tom]] ([[Roger Oakley]]) and  [[Pippa Ross|Pippa]] ([[Vanessa Downing]]), and their five foster children, [[Frank Morgan (Home and Away)|Frank Morgan]] ([[Alex Papps]]), [[Carly Morris]] ([[Sharyn Hodgson]]), [[Lynn Davenport]] (Helena Bozich), [[Steven Matheson]] ([[Adam Willits]]) and [[Sally Fletcher]] ([[Kate Ritchie]]) – who relocated from the city and moved into the [[Summer Bay#Summer Bay House|Summer Bay House]], where they took on the new job of running the caravan park, and eventually took in a sixth foster child, [[Bobby Simpson (Home and Away)|Bobby Simpson]] ([[Nicolle Dickson]]). ''Home and Away'' was not without controversy. During the first season alone, it featured several adult-themed storylines such as teen pregnancy, drug and alcohol addiction and drug overdose. A storyline, in particular concerning rape outraged the public and a protest erupted, as viewers deemed it an inappropriate subject to be covering in an early evening time slot. The series has dealt with similar storylines over the years which have often exceeded its restricted time slot. [[Palm Beach, New South Wales|Palm Beach]] in [[Sydney]]'s [[Northern Beaches]] district has been used as the location for Summer Bay since 1988. The exterior scenes are filmed mainly at Palm Beach, while the interior scenes are filmed at the [[Australian Technology Park]] in [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].

''Home and Away'' has been sold to over eighty countries around the world, making it one of Australia's successful media exports. It is popular in the United Kingdom, and is one of the highest-rating shows on [[RTÉ Television]] in Ireland and [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] in New Zealand. In Australia, ''Home and Away'' is the most awarded program at the [[Logie Awards]], with a total of forty-six wins, including [[Logie Award for Best Drama Program|Best Drama Program]]. Some cast members have won several other awards such as the [[Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television|Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television]], [[Logie Award for Most Popular Actor|Silver Logie for Most Popular Actor]], and [[Logie Award for Most Popular Actress|Most Popular Actress]]. In 2015, ''Home and Away'' was inducted into the [[Logie Hall of Fame]].

===Rating and restrictions===
Since 1988, ''Home and Away'' has dealt with some controversial issues, despite being broadcast in a G-rated timezone. In 2007, the show breached broadcasting rules when they aired a number of episodes featuring [[Martha MacKenzie]] ([[Jodi Gordon]]) involved with pole-dancing in the G classification, as the [[Australian Communications and Media Authority]] (ACMA) said that these episodes should have been rated PG as they contained sexual scenes and references.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/home-and-away-too-saucy-for-rating/story-e6frfmyi-1111114569324|title=Home and Away too saucy for rating|publisher=news.com.au|date=4 October 2007|accessdate=August 22, 2007}}</ref> Since 2008, every subsequent episode has been broadcast under the PG classification and often continues to exceed the rating. A 2010 episode which featured Martha McKenzie engaging in a sexual scene with [[Liam Murphy]] ([[Axle Whitehead]]) on a kitchen table was deemed "too raunchy" by a television watchdog in New Zealand, as the series was also aired in a G-rated timezone at 5:30 pm on [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1313959/Home-Away-wholesome-Aussie-soap-raunchy-New-Zealand.html|title=Home and Away just grew up: Love scene ruled too raunchy by New Zealand TV|work=[[Daily Mail Australia]]|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>
