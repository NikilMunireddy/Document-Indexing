'''Hulu''' is an American online company and partially [[ad-supported]] [[media service provider|streaming service]] offering a selection of TV shows, clips, movies, and other [[streaming media]] on Hulu.com. Hulu subscribers can access episodes in HD (when available) from [[ABC Television Network|ABC]], the [[CW Television Network|CW]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[NBC]] the day after they air, via Internet-connected devices. Hulu offers a monthly subscription fee service available on computers and laptops, Internet-connected game consoles, [[Personal Video Recorder|PVR]]s, smartphones, tablets, TVs, and other devices.

{{as of|2016}} Hulu is offered only to users in Japan and the United States and its overseas territories. Other regions are [[Geo-blocking|blocked]] by [[IP address]] location. Hulu provides video in [[Flash Video]] format, including many films and shows that are available in [[288p]], [[360p]], [[480p]], and in some cases, [[720p]]. Hulu also provides [[web syndication]] services for other websites including [[AOL]], [[Google]], [[MSN]], [[Myspace]], [[Comcast Interactive Media|XfinityTV]], and [[Yahoo!]].

Hulu is a subsidiary of Hulu, LLC, a joint venture of [[Disney–ABC Television Group]] ([[The Walt Disney Company]]),<ref name="abchulu">{{cite news|author=Kramer, Staci D. |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/30/AR2009043001853.html |title= It's Official: Disney Joins News Corp., NBCU In Hulu; Deal Includes Some Cable Nets|date= April 30, 2006|accessdate= October 30, 2006}}</ref> [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] ([[21st Century Fox]]), and [[NBCUniversal Television Group]] ([[Comcast]]).<ref>Although NBCUniversal is a major shareholder (32%) of Hulu, by the [[Federal Communications Commission]], NBCUniversal and Comcast are required not to exercise any right to influence the conduct or operation of Hulu.

==Name==
The name Hulu comes from two [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]] words, ''húlú'' ([[wikt:葫芦|葫芦]]/[[wikt:葫蘆|葫蘆]]), "[[calabash]]; bottle gourd", and ''hùlù'' ([[wikt:互录|互录]]/[[wikt:互錄|互錄]]), "interactive recording". The company blog explains:
<blockquote>In Mandarin, ''Hulu'' has two interesting meanings, each highly relevant to our mission. The primary meaning interested us because it is used in an ancient Chinese proverb that describes the Hulu as the holder of precious things. It literally translates to "gourd," and in ancient times, the Hulu was hollowed out and used to hold precious things. The secondary meaning is "interactive recording." We saw both definitions as appropriate bookends and highly relevant to the mission of Hulu.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kilar|first=Jason|title=What's in a Name?|date=2008-05-14|url=http://blog.hulu.com/2008/05/13/meaning-of-hulu/ |accessdate=2010-07-17|postscript=.}}</ref></blockquote>

In July 2007, [[Providence Equity Partners]], the owner of [[Newport Television]], became one of the earliest "outside" investors by purchasing a 10 percent stake in the company for [[United States dollar|US$]]100 million [[equity (finance)|equity investment]],<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cable360.net/competition/web/25376.html|title = NBC and Fox Jump Through Hulu Hoop|accessdate = 2007-08-29|date = August 29, 2006|first = Shirley|last = Brady|work = Cable360.net|dead-url = yes|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071206130905/http://www.cable360.net/competition/web/25376.html|archive-date = December 6, 2007}}</ref> before the company was known as "Hulu".<ref name=":0" /> With its investment came a seat on the board of directors, where Providence was said to act as an "independent voice on the board".<ref name=":0" />  In October 2012, Providence sold its 10 percent stake to "Hulu's media owners" and ceased participation in the board.<ref name=":0">{{cite news|url = http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/12/providence-equity-sells-its-stake-in-hulu/|title = It’s Done: Early Hulu Investor Providence Equity Partners Has Sold Its Stake For $200M|accessdate = 2012-05-12|date = May 12, 2012|first = Ryan|last = Lawler|work = techcrunch.com}}</ref>

Early in 2010, Hulu chief executive Jason Kilar said the service had made a profit in two quarters and that the company could top $100 million in revenue by summer 2010, more than its income for all of 2009.

Following the start of its service, Hulu signed deals with several new content providers making additional material available to consumers.

On April 30, 2009, [[The Walt Disney Company]] announced that it would join the venture, purchasing a 27 percent stake in Hulu.<ref name="abchulu"/>

Starting August 15, 2011, viewers of content from Fox and related networks are required to authenticate paid cable or satellite service wherever Fox streams episodes, including on Hulu, to be able to watch them the morning after the first airing. Non-subscribers will see those episodes delayed a week before they are viewable.<ref>[[Brian Stelter]], ''[[The New York Times]]''.

In 2015, Hulu began offering content from [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] for only an additional $8.99/month, still cheaper than Showtime's own streaming service. [[CBS]] remains the only major network not offered on Hulu despite offering CBS-owned Showtime and CBS co-owned The CW.

=== {{anchor|Hulu Plus}} Hulu Subscription Service===
At an industry conference held on October 21, 2009, [[News Corporation]] Deputy Chairman [[Chase Carey]] stated that Hulu "needs to evolve to have a meaningful subscription model as part of its business" and that it would likely start charging for at least some content by 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/ADverse_Atkinson_on_Advertising/23941-Chase_Carey_Hulu_to_Charge_in_2010.php?nid=2228&source=title&rid=6454445 |title=Chase Carey: Hulu to Charge in 2010 |date=2009-10-21 |author=Atkinson, Claire |work=Broadcasting & Cable |publisher=Reed Business Information |accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref> Carey's comment jibes with other News Corp. heads, including Rupert Murdoch who has expressed a desire to charge for content with a number of online units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-10381622-261.html |title=More signs Hulu subscription service is coming |first=Greg |last=Sandoval |date=22 October 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2009 |work=Media Maverick |publisher=CNET}}</ref>

The free Hulu is only available on PCs and laptops, while a Hulu subscription allows viewers to access Hulu through all Hulu-supported devices including set-top boxes, smart TVs, gaming consoles, mobile devices and more.

==Viewership==
Viewership numbers for the site are tracked by measurement firms such as [[ComScore]], [[Nielsen ratings]], and [[Quantcast]]. In partnership with comScore, Hulu is the first digital company to receive multi-platform measurement at an individual level that includes co-viewing for living room devices. When factoring this in, Hulu's reach among A18-49 increases 50 percent.

However, the reliability of these metrics has been drawn into question, partly due to widely divergent estimates. For example, between May and June 2010, ComScore updated its scoring methodology and its estimates for Hulu dropped from 43.5 million unique viewers to 24 million in a single month.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/26/business/la-fi-ct-hulu-20100721|title=Hulu's sharp decline in viewership underscores inconsistency in measuring size of online audience|publisher=LA Times|author=Dawn C.

{{Further|List of original programs distributed by Hulu}}
As of January 17, 2011, Hulu has streamed its own in-house web series ''[[The Morning After (web series)|The Morning After]]'', a light-hearted pop-culture news show. It is produced by Hulu in conjunction with [[Jace Hall]]'s HDFilms and stars Brian Kimmet and Ginger Gonzaga. Producing the show is a first for the company, which in the past has been primarily a content distributor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/video/new-series-the-morning-after-nudges-hulu-into-production/ |title=New Series The Morning After Nudges Hulu Into Production |date=2011-01-18|author=Liz Shannon Miller |publisher=GigaOM |accessdate=2011-05-02}}</ref>

On January 16, 2012, Hulu announced that it would be airing its first original script based program, titled ''[[Battleground (TV series)|Battleground]]'', scheduled to air in February 2012. The program will air on Hulu's free web service rather than on the subscription-based Hulu Plus. ''Battleground'' is described as a documentary-style political drama.<ref>Rother, Larry, January 16, 2012, [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/16/hulu-announces-first-original-script-based-program/ "Hulu Announces First Original-Script-Based Program".]</ref>

Later that same month, Hulu announced it would air ''The Fashion Fund'', a six-part reality series, and the winner of the show will receive $300,000 to start their career.<ref>Poggi Jeanine January 27, 2012. [http://adage.com/article/mediaworks/hulu-introduces-fashion-fund-original-reality-series/232384/ Hulu Adds Unscripted Series 'The Fashion Fund,' Accelerating Original Content Effort."]</ref>

To continue with its original programming movement, Hulu announced that there will be a total of seven original programs that are planned to air on its service: ''Battleground'', ''Day in the Life'', and ''Up to Speed''  were previously mentioned; and on April 19, Hulu added four more shows to its list:  ''Don't Quit Your Daydream'', ''Flow'', ''The Awesomes'', and ''We Got Next''. Some of these programs began airing in 2012, while others will premiere over the next few years.<ref>{{cite news|author=Perez, Sarah|date= April 19, 2012|url= http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/19/hulu-announces-four-more-original-series-will-feature-snl-vets-adrian-grenier-of-hbos-entourage-others/|work=TechCrunch|title=Hulu Announces Four More Original Series}}</ref>

On May 21, 2012, Hulu announced it would be bringing [[Kevin Smith]] to its line-up of original programming. Smith hosts a movie discussion show titled ''Spoilers'', which began airing in the summer of 2012.<ref>{{cite news|author=Wasserman, Todd|date= May 21, 2012| title=Hulu to Launch New Show With Kevin Smith Plus 9 Other Titles|url= http://mashable.com/2012/05/21/hulu-new-shows-kevin-smith/|work=Mashable}}</ref>

===''South Park''===
On July 12, 2014, it was announced that Hulu had signed a three-year deal purchasing exclusive online streaming rights to the ''[[South Park]]'' library. Through the deal, the [[South Park]] Studios website became powered by the Hulu video and advertising experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/pecom/20140712005015/en|title=Hulu and South Park Announce Exclusive Multi-Year Content Licensing Deal at 2014 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour - Business Wire|work=businesswire.com}}</ref> Along with this, the domain name changed from "southparkstudios.com" to "southpark.cc.com".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://southparkstudios.com|title=South Park - Watch Full Episodes, Clips & More|work=southparkstudios.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://southpark.cc.com|title=South Park - Watch Full Episodes, Clips & More|work=cc.com}}</ref> Previously, the show had been removed from [[Netflix]], along with other titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knowyourmobile.com/apps/20082/netflix-removes-south-park-and-other-titles-its-library|title=Netflix removes South Park and other titles from its library|work=Know Your Mobile}}</ref> The new site launch caused a few technical issues, but everything was fixed and fans are able to watch full, uncensored <ref>http://www.maxim.com/gadgets/all-uncensored-south-park-episodes-available-legally-free-online</ref> episodes and clips again on southpark.cc.com and Hulu. For viewers outside the US, episodes and clips still stream through the “classic” South Park player and nothing changed aside from the new site design. A handful of countries have their own localized versions of South Park sites – fans in these countries can continue to watch episodes and interact with other fans exactly as before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://southpark.cc.com/blog/2014/07/28/south-park-new-site-faqs|title=South Park  – New Site FAQs|work=cc.com}}</ref>

It was announced that beginning in September 2014, following the premiere of the 18th season, only 30 select episodes will be featured for free viewing at a time on the website, with new episodes being available for an entire month starting the day following their original airings. The entire series is available for viewing on the Hulu subscription service.

===[[AT&T]]===
On May 14, 2015, [[AT&T]] struck a deal with Hulu that would give its customers access to streaming service on both regular and premium tiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/05/14/att-strikes-deal-hulu-offer-subscription-service-its-customers|title=AT&T strikes deal with Hulu to offer subscription service to its customers|last=Smiley|first=Minda|work=The Drum|date=May 14, 2015|accessdate=May 14, 2015}}</ref>

===[[Neon Alley]]===
At the start of April 2014, [[Neon Alley]], a [[Viz Media]]-owned 24/7 anime-oriented streaming service that started on October 2, 2012,<ref>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2012-10-02/viz-debuts-neon-alley</ref> streaming to both [[US]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] markets (similar to Æsir Media Group LLC and Valkyrie Media Partners LLC's [[Anime Network]], [[Peter Chernin|The Chernin Group]] and [[TV Tokyo]]'s [[Crunchyroll]] and [[Aniplex of America]]'s [[Aniplex of America#Aniplex Channel|Aniplex Channel]]), discontinued its web network format and relaunched as a Free Video on Demand ([[Video on demand|FVOD]]) service streaming anime to the US market through its website or [[Internet]]-connected devices through Hulu. As a result, with Hulu being unable to stream to the Canadian market, Neon Alley stopped streaming to that market and restricted its service to the US market only.  This leaves [[Anime Network]], [[Crunchyroll]], [[Daisuki (website)|Daisuki]] and [[Aniplex of America#Aniplex Channel|Aniplex Channel]] as the only anime-focused streaming services streaming to the Canadian market at the same time as the US market, though these four all continue today. As of December 2015, a plan for the service to re-enter has yet to be announced.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-02-20/.85204|title=Answerman Life Is Just A Game|date=February 20, 2015}}</ref>

It should be noted that Hulu is known for streaming anime titles from many distributors, including [[Funimation]], [[TMS Entertainment]], and [[Bandai Visual]], in addition to Viz Media.

===[[Nippon TV]] acquisition of Hulu Japan service===
In 2013, Nippon Television Network Corporation ([[Nippon TV]]) acquired Hulu’s [[Japan]] business. The transaction, which is subject to certain regulatory conditions, marked Nippon TV’s entry into the SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand) business. Through the acquisition, the Hulu service continues to offer Japanese consumers premium content, including Hollywood and Japanese films and dramas and popular television programming. Additionally, Nippon TV’s popular shows and original exclusive content launched on the Hulu service in Japan, expanding its content offering.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nippon TV Acquires Hulu Service in Japan |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140227006802/en/Nippon-TV-Acquires-Hulu-Service-Japan#.VDgcsdTF9_0Hi |publisher=Businesswire |date=2014-02-27}}</ref> Japanese users have access to a library of popular television shows such as the CSI franchise, ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', ''[[Prison Break]]'', and ''[[Ugly Betty]]'', and  as well as movies such as ''[[Armageddon (1998 film)|Armageddon]]'', ''[[Men in Black]]'', and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title= Hulu launches its first overseas operation in Japan |url=http://asiapacificarts.usc.edu/article@apa?hulu_launches_its_first_overseas_operation_in_japan_17333.aspx |work= Asia Pacific Arts |date=2011-09-01}}</ref>

===[[UK]] and [[Ireland]] launch===
Hulu was planning on launching in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] in September 2009, but as of April 2010 these had been abandoned for the foreseeable future after failure to sign any content deals.<ref>Barnett, Emma. [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/7639763/Hulu-abandons-UK-plans-after-broadcaster-talks-collapse.html Hulu 'abandons UK plans' after broadcaster talks collapse], ''The Daily Telegraph'', April 27, 2010. Retrieved April 28, 2010.</ref> In July 2010, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' revealed that Hulu had been working on plans for an international launch of Hulu Plus for several months, and had identified the UK and Japan as markets where its free website and subscription model could feasibly work.<ref>Garrahan, Matthew.

===Absence in [[Canada|Canadian]] market=== 
Hulu is unable to launch in [[Canada]], due to the relative small size of Canada's online advertising market, and because Canada's television networks already have the exclusive online streaming rights in Canada to several titles offered on Hulu, including many mainstream American television network programs.<ref>https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2015-02-20/.85204</ref> The absence of Hulu in the Canadian market raised concerns by fans of the sitcom ''[[The Mindy Project]]'' when it was cancelled by Fox in the spring of 2015 and subsequently picked up by Hulu; the show's Canadian broadcaster, [[City (TV network)|City]], subsequently announced it would continue to air the series in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mindy Project staying on City despite being dropped by Fox|url=http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2015/05/25/mindy-project-staying-on-city-despite-being-dropped-by-fox.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=27 September 2015}}</ref> At present, Canadian consumers have access to several other streaming systems, including a Canadian version of [[Netflix]], [[Shomi]], [[CraveTV]] and [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]], but with both Shomi and CraveTV streaming some programming from inaccessible-to-Canadian-viewers platforms such as Hulu and Amazon.
