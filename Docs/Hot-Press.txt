It is edited by Niall Stokes.<ref name="Rockers out in force for Hot Press launch"/> Since then, the magazine has featured some significant stories in the music world, both in Ireland and internationally. ''Hot Press'' has covered the career of [[U2]] since the late 1970s. [[Sinéad O'Connor]] first talked to ''Hot Press'' about her lesbianism. ''Hot Press'' writer Stuart Clark was present on the day that [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] came closest to splitting up. He gained an insight into the life of band member [[Noel Gallagher]], including an interruption to the interview during which the Oasis songwriter was told that his brother Liam would not be gigging with the band that night.
<blockquote>"Fuck, no way man," he (Noel Gallagher) insists. "I'll probably get away with it tonight but I'm not as good a singer as he is. I'd much rather be stood in front of me amplifier doing the odd backing-vocal. The cunt! I tell you what I'm tempted to do – go on stage and tell the crowd his room number so they can go round the hotel and get their money back off him."<ref>[http://www.hotpress.com/music/interviews/416250.html The First Noel<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref></blockquote>

''Hot Press'' was at the centre of a legal dispute over the copyright of the term [[De Dannan]] in 2009 after it featured an advertisement using the term to promote a new tour by the traditional group.<ref name="Trad legends jig about with a legendary name">{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/trad-legends-jig-about-with-a-legendary-name-1841533.html|title=Oxegen Trad legends jig about with a legendary name|date=26 July 2009|accessdate=3 August 2009|publisher=''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]''}}</ref> In September 2009, an interview conducted by [[Olaf Tyaransen]] with the comedian [[Tommy Tiernan]] at [[Electric Picnic 2009]] proved controversial when Tiernan made some remarks which were later perceived as [[antisemitism|antisemitic]].

<blockquote>The sort of smug know-all commentator... I suppose if anything annoys me, that annoys me... I could instance a load of fuckers whose throat I'd cut, and push over the nearest cliff, but there's no percentage in that. – Former [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey]] speaking to ''Hot Press'' writer [[John Waters (columnist)|John Waters]] in 1984.<ref name="Biffo takes his place in pantheon of the gaffers">{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/newsfeatures/2008/0524/1211522099982.html|title=Biffo takes his place in pantheon of the gaffers|date=24 May 2008|accessdate=24 February 2009|publisher=''[[The Irish Times]]''}}</ref></blockquote>

In his May 2007 interview with [[Jason O'Toole (journalist)|Jason O'Toole]], former [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]] Cowen admitted to smoking [[marijuana]], saying,

<blockquote>Anyone who went to the [[University College Dublin - National University of Ireland, Dublin|UCD]] bar in the '70s that didn't get a whiff of marijuana would be telling you a lie. I would say there were a couple of occasions when it was passed around – and, unlike [[Bill Clinton|President Clinton]], I did inhale! There wasn't a whole lot in it really – (it was like) a Sweet Afton, as a 10-year-old, under a railway bridge on a rainy day, in small town Ireland in the late '60s. I certainly got more enjoyment out of a few pints.</blockquote>

This confession later provoked much criticism from opposition parties in the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/archive/2926423.html|title=The man who would be king|accessdate=14 December 2007}}</ref> Ministers [[Willie O'Dea]] and [[Brian Lenihan, Jnr]] played down the controversy, denying Cowen was "setting a bad example".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0517/election2.html|title=Election 2007: Fianna Fáil's crime strategy|date=17 May 2007|accessdate=27 December 2009|publisher=[[RTÉ News and Current Affairs]]}}</ref> Mr. Cowen later became [[Taoiseach]] following the resignation of [[Bertie Ahern]].

In June 2007, [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]]'s [[Ian Paisley, Jr.]] [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] caused uproar in an interview with Jason O'Toole by publicly denouncing acts associated with homosexuality. This was the year before [[Iris Robinson]], wife of [[Office of the First Minister and deputy First Minister|First Minister]], [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]] made her thoughts on the issue.<ref>

The interview, conducted once again by Jason O'Toole (on this occasion in [[Brussels]]), had McCreevy say that Ireland's decision to reject the [[Lisbon Treaty]] had to be respected by the rest of Europe.
