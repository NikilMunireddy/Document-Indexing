'''Albany County''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|l|b|ə|n|iː}} {{Respell|AWL|bə-nee}}) is a [[county (United States)|county]] located in the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[New York]], in the [[United States]]. Its northern border is formed by the [[Mohawk River]], at its confluence with the [[Hudson River]], which is on the east. As of the [[United States Census 2010|2010 census]], the population was 304,204.<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/36001.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}</ref>  The [[county seat]] is [[Albany, New York|Albany]],<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> the state capital. As originally established by the English government in the colonial era, Albany County had an indefinite amount of land, but has only {{convert|530|sqmi}} as of March 3, 1888. The county is named for the [[Duke of York]] and [[Duke of Albany|of Albany]], who became [[James II of England]] (James VII of Scotland).

Albany County constitutes the central core of the [[Capital District]] of New York State, which comprises the Albany-[[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]]-[[Troy, New York|Troy]], NY [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|Metropolitan Statistical Area]].

==History==

===Colonial===
After England took control of New Netherland from the Dutch, Albany County was created on November 1, 1683 by [[New York Governor]] [[Thomas Dongan, 2nd Earl of Limerick|Thomas Dongan]], and later confirmed on October 1, 1691.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W. Munsell | year = 1886 | accessdate = 2009-08-28 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=HGkJAQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=history+of+albany+county&q= | page = 12}}</ref> The act creating the county vaguely defined its territory "to containe the Towns of Albany, the Collony Rensselaerwyck, Schonecteda, and all the villages, neighborhoods, and Christian Plantaçons on the east side of Hudson River from Roelef's Creek, and on the west side from Sawyer's Creek ([[Saugerties (village), New York|Saugerties]]) to the Sarraghtoga."<ref name=page70>{{cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W.

Livingston Manor was annexed to Albany County from Dutchess County in 1717.<ref name=page70/>

Albany's boundaries were defined more closely as various state statutes would add land to the county, or more commonly subtract land for the formation of new counties.<ref name=page71>{{cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W.

The city of Albany was the first municipality within this large county,<ref name=page71/> founded as the village (dorp in Dutch) of [[Beverwyck]] by the [[Director-General of New Amsterdam]], [[Pieter Stuyvesant]], who also established the first court in Albany.<ref>{{cite book| title = The Settlement and Early History of Albany | first = William| last = Barnes | publisher = Gould, Banks, & Gould | year = 1851 | page = 17}}</ref> Albany was established as a city in 1686 by Governor Dongan through the [[Dongan Charter]] after the English took over the colony.<ref name=page71/> [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] to the west was given a patent with some municipal rights in 1684 and became a borough in 1765.<ref name=Genealogy/>

The [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck]] was created as a district within the county in 1772, and subsequently divided into two districts, one on each side of the Hudson River in 1779. The west district included all of what is now Albany County with the exception of what lands were in the city of Albany at that time.<ref name=page72>{{cite book | title = Bi-Centennial History of Albany | author = George Howell and Jonathan Tenney | publisher = W.W.

[[Pittstown, New York|Pittstown]] in 1761, and [[Duanesburgh, New York|Duanesburgh]] in 1764, were created as townships. But when districts were created in 1772, those townships were incorporated into new districts, Pittstown in [[Schaghticoke, New York|Schaghticoke]] and Duanesburgh into the United Districts of Duanesburgh and Schoharie.<ref name=Genealogy/> Schenectady was made from a borough to a district in 1772 as well.<ref name=Gazetteer>{{cite book | title = Gazetteer of the State of New York | first = John| last = French | page = 598 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=R_zHwh4xByQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=gazetteer+new+york#v=onepage&q=saratoga%20county | year = 1860 | accessdate = 2009-08-30 | publisher = R. Pearsall Smith}}</ref> Other districts established in 1772 were [[Hoosick, New York|Hoosick]], [[Coxsackie, New York|Coxsackie]], [[Cambridge, New York|Cambridge]], [[Saratoga, New York|Saratoga]], [[Halfmoon, New York|Halfmoon]], [[Kinderhook, New York|Kinderhook]], [[Canaan, New York|Kings]], [[Claverack, New York|Claverack]], [[Catskill (town), New York|Great Imboght]], and the [[Livingston Manor|Manor of Livingston]].

In a census of 1697, there were 1,452 individuals living in Albany County; two years later it would be counted as 2,016 at the beginning of [[King William's War]]. By the end of the war in 1698, the population had dropped to 1,482, but rebounded quickly and was at 2,273 by 1703. By 1723, it had increased to 6,501 and in 1731 to 8,573, which was slightly less than the population within the city of New York in the same year. In 1737, the inhabitants of Albany County would outnumber those of New York County by 17 people. In 1774, Albany County, with 42,706 people, was the largest county in colonial New York. According to the first Federal Census in 1790, Albany County reached 75,921 inhabitants and was still the largest county in the state.<ref>{{cite web | title = Albany County | publisher = New York State Museum | url = http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/albanycounty.html | accessdate = 2009-08-30}}</ref>

===Formation of towns===
On March 7, 1788, the state of New York divided the entire state into towns eliminating districts as administrative units by passing New York Laws of 1788, Chapters 63 and 64.<ref name=Law>{{cite book | title = Laws of the State of New York | url = https://books.google.com/?id=GBWxAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA748&dq=an+act+for+dividing+the+counties+of+this+state+into+towns&q=an%20act%20for%20dividing%20the%20counties%20of%20this%20state%20into%20towns | page = 748 | publisher = State of New York | year = 1788 | accessdate = 2009-08-31 | author1 = (state), New York}}</ref>

===Timeline of boundary changes===
[[File:Albany County 1777.png|thumb|left|300px|Albany County in 1777]]
Albany County was one of the original twelve counties created by the [[Province of New York]] on November 1, 1683.<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch 4/1:122)</ref> At that time it included all of New York state north of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess]] and [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster]] counties, all of what is now [[Bennington County, Vermont|Bennington County]] in [[Vermont]],  and theoretically stretched west to the Pacific Ocean.<ref name="NYATLAS">Thorne, Kathryn Ford, Compiler & Long, John H., Editor: ''New York Atlas of Historical County Boundaries''; The Newbury Library; 1993.</ref>

On May 27, 1717, Albany County was adjusted to gain an indefinite amount of land from Dutchess County and other non-county lands.<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch 333/1:915).</ref>

On October 7, 1763, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], as part of his [[Proclamation of 1763]], created the new province of [[Province of Quebec (1763-1791)|Quebec]], implicitly setting the northern limit of New York at the parallel of [[45th parallel north|45 degrees north latitude]] from the Atlantic-St. Lawrence watershed westward to the [[St. Lawrence River]], implicitly setting the northern limit of Albany County, but it was never mapped.<ref>(Cappon, Petchenik, and Long, 1, 77, 90; Shortt and Doughty, 119—120).</ref>

On July 20, 1764, King George III established the boundary between [[New Hampshire]] and New York along the west bank of the [[Connecticut River]], north of [[Massachusetts]] and south of the parallel of [[45th parallel north|45 degrees north latitude]]. Albany County implicitly gained present-day [[Vermont]]. Although disputes occasionally broke out later, this line became the boundary between New Hampshire and Vermont, and has remained unchanged to the present. When New York refused to recognize land titles through the [[New Hampshire Grants]] (towns created earlier by New Hampshire in present Vermont), dissatisfied colonists organized in opposition, which led to the creation of independent Vermont in 1777.<ref>(Slade, 13—19; Van Zandt, 63).</ref>

On July 3, 1766, [[Cumberland County, New York|Cumberland County]] was partitioned from Albany County to cover all territory to the northern and eastern limits of the colony, including [[Windsor County, Vermont|Windsor County]], most of [[Windham County, Vermont|Windham County]], and parts of [[Bennington County, Vermont|Bennington]] and [[Rutland County, Vermont|Rutland]] counties in present-day [[Vermont]].<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1297/4:904).</ref>

On June 26, 1767, Albany County regained all of Cumberland County.<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1297/4:903).</ref>

On March 19, 1768, Albany County was re-partitioned, and Cumberland County restored.<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1559/5:400).</ref>

On March 16, 1770, Albany County was again partitioned. [[Gloucester County, New York|Gloucester County]] was created to include all of [[Orange County, Vermont|Orange]], [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia]] and [[Essex County, Vermont|Essex]] counties, most of [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]], and parts of [[Orleans County, Vermont|Orleans]], [[Lamoille County, Vermont|Lamoille]], [[Addison County, Vermont|Addison]] and [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden]] counties in present-day Vermont.<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1559/5:401).</ref>

On March 12, 1772, Albany County was partitioned again, this time into the counties of Albany, [[Tryon County, New York|Tryon]] (now [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]]), and [[Charlotte County, Province of New York|Charlotte]] (now [[Washington County, New York|Washington]]). This established a definite area for Albany County of {{convert|5,470|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1534/5:321).</ref>

On March 24, 1772, Albany County was partitioned again, with an additional {{convert|50|sqmi}} handed over to Cumberland County.<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1559/5:402).</ref>

On March 9, 1774, Albany County was partitioned again, this time passing {{convert|1090|sqmi}} to [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]].<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1665/5:662).</ref>

On April 1, 1775, Albany was again partitioned, this time giving up {{convert|60|sqmi}} to Charlotte County, who then exchanged this land with a like parcel in Cumberland County.<ref>(N.Y. Col. Laws, ch. 1719/5:779).</ref>

On January 15, 1777, Albany County was again partitioned, this time on account of the independence of [[Vermont]] from New York, reducing Albany County by an additional {{convert|300|sqmi}}.<ref>(Slade, 70–73; Van Zandt, 64; C. Williamson, 82–84, map facing 95, 100–102, 112–113).</ref>

On June 26, 1781, Bennington County, Vermont attempted to annex a portion of Albany County that today includes portions of [[Washington County, New York|Washington]] and [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]] counties to form what they called "The West Union".<ref>(Vt. State papers, 13:45–46).</ref> The fledgling United States – under the [[Articles of Confederation]] – arbitrated this annexation, and condemned it, resulting in Vermont ceasing the annexation on 1782-02-23.<ref>(Vt. State papers, vol 3, pt. 2; pp. 67–68).</ref>

On April 4, 1786, [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]] was created from {{convert|650|sqmi}} of Albany County land.<ref>(N.Y. Laws 1786, 9th sess., ch. 28/p. 49).</ref>

On March 7, 1788, New York, refusing to recognize the independence of [[Vermont]], and the attendant elimination of Cumberland County, attempted to adjust the line that separated Cumberland from Albany County in present-day Vermont, but to no effect.<ref>(N.Y. Laws 1788, 11th sess., ch. 63/pp. 746–747).</ref>

On February 7, 1791, Albany County was partitioned again, this time to form [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer]] and [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga]] counties. Rensselaer received {{convert|660|sqmi}}, while Saratoga received {{convert|850|sqmi}}. Also the town of [[Cambridge (town), New York|Cambridge]] was transferred to [[Washington County, New York|Washington County]]. A total of {{convert|1680|sqmi}} changed hands.<ref>(N.Y. Laws 1791, 14th sess., ch. 4/p. 201).</ref>

On June 1, 1795, Albany County was once again partitioned, this time losing {{convert|460|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} to [[Schoharie County, New York|Schoharie County]].<ref>(N.Y. Laws 1795, 18th sess., ch. 42/p. 588).</ref>

On April 5, 1798, another partition took place, with {{convert|90|sqmi}} passing to [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]].<ref>(N.Y. Laws 1798,21st sess., ch. 93/p. 273).</ref>

On March 25, 1800, once again Albany County was partitioned, with {{convert|360|sqmi}} being used to create [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]].<ref>(N.Y. Laws 1800, 23rd sess., ch. 59/p. 503).</ref>

On April 3, 1801, all New York counties were redefined, with Albany County gaining {{convert|10|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>(N.Y. Laws 1801,24th sess., ch. 123/p. 290).</ref>

On March 3, 1808, Albany County turned [[Havre Island]] over to [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]], with no resultant loss in land.<ref>(N.Y. Laws 1888, 111th sess., ch. 42/p. 85).</ref>

On March 7, 1809, [[Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady County]] was created from {{convert|230|sqmi}} of Albany County land,<ref>(N.Y. Laws 1808, 32nd sess., ch. 65, sec. 1/p. 458).</ref> reducing Albany County to its current size.<ref name="NYATLAS"/>

According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|533|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|523|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|10|sqmi}} (2.0%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_36.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 3, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>

Albany County is in the east central part of New York, extending southward and westward from the point where the [[Mohawk River]] joins the [[Hudson River]]. Its eastern boundary is the Hudson; a portion of its northern boundary is the Mohawk.

The terrain of the county ranges from flat near the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers to high and hilly to the southwest, of the [[Helderberg Escarpment]] and the [[Helderberg Mountains]]. The highest point is one of several summits near '''Henry Hill''' at approximately 2,160 feet (658 m) above sea level; the lowest point is sea level along the Hudson.

The county also occasionally receives [[Alberta clipper]]s. Winters are often very cold with fluctuating conditions, temperatures often drop to below 0&nbsp;°F (−18&nbsp;°C) at night. Summers in the Albany can contain stretches of excessive heat and humidity, with temperatures above&nbsp;{{convert|90|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and dew points near 70.

==Cityscape==

===Architecture===
Albany County has a myriad of different architectural styles spanning centuries of development.<ref>{{cite web | title = Architecture | url= http://www.docstoc.com/docs/4936290/ARCHITECTURE-Architecture-ALBANY-COUNTY-If-architecture-is-your-passion | accessdate = 2009-08-26}}</ref> Within the city of Albany alone there is Dutch Colonial (the [[Quackenbush House]]), French Renaissance (the [[New York State Capitol]]), Federal style (the original Albany Academy in Academy Park), Romanesque Revival ([[Albany City Hall]]), Art deco (the Alfred E. Smith Building), and Modern (Empire State Plaza). The cities of Albany, Cohoes, and Watervliet and the village of Green Island are more urban in architecture; while the towns of Colonie, Guilderland, New Scotland, and Bethlehem more suburban and the remaining Hilltowns (Berne, Knox, Westerlo, and Rensselaerville) very rural.

===Parks===
Albany County is home to the Emma Treadwell Thacher Nature Center, which opened in July 2001 and is located near the shore of Thompson's Lake between the two state parks that are in Albany County- [[Thompson's Lake State Park]] and [[John Boyd Thacher State Park]]. There are also state-owned nature preserves with interactive educational programs such as the Five Rivers Environmental Education Center and the [[Albany Pine Bush]]. The cities, towns, and villages of Albany County have many municipal parks, playgrounds, and protected green areas. [[Washington Park (Albany, New York)|Washington Park]] in the city of Albany and The Crossing in the town of Colonie are two of the largest. There are many small hiking and biking trails and longer distance bike-hike trails such the [[Mohawk Hudson Hike/Bike Trail|Mohawk-Hudson Bike-Hike Trail]] which goes from the city of Albany north to Cohoes and then west along the Mohawk River to Schenectady County.

===Festivals===
One of the largest events in Albany County is the [[Tulip Festival (Albany, New York)|Tulip Fest]] held in the city of Albany every spring at [[Washington Park Historic District (Albany, New York)|Washington Park]]. The tradition stems from when [[List of mayors of Albany, New York|Mayor]] [[Erastus Corning 2nd]] had a city ordinance passed declaring the [[tulip]] as Albany's official flower on July 1, 1948.<ref>{{cite web | title = Albany Tulip Queen | publisher = Albany Tulip Queen.com | accessdate = 2009-06-07 | url = http://www.albanytulipqueen.com/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090519054142/http://www.albanytulipqueen.com/| archivedate= 19 May 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The [[African-American]] tradition of [[Pinkster]]fest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest.

Albany County has two shopping malls that are classified as [[super-regional mall]]s (malls with over 800,000 sq ft),<ref name="ISCS_definitions-2004">[http://www.icsc.org/srch/lib/USDefinitions.pdf International Council of Shopping Centers] Shopping Center Definitions for the U.S. Information accurate as of 2004. Retrieved February 20, 2007.</ref> [[Crossgates Mall]] in [[Guilderland, New York|Guilderland]] and [[Colonie Center]] in Colonie with over one million square feet of rentable space in each. A [[regional mall]], the [[Latham Circle Mall]], is in [[Latham, New York|Latham]] (town of Colonie). Huck Finn's Playland is located in Albany's Warehouse District just North of downtown Albany.  Huck Finn's Playland is a children's amusement park open during the summer.  Huck Finn's started operations in the Summer of 2015, after purchasing the rides from the former Hoffman's Playland in [[Newtonville, New York|Newtonville]], which was in operation from 1951 to the Fall of 2014.  During the winter there are over {{convert|18|mi|km}} of official trails for snowshoeing at the [[Albany Pine Bush]] Preserve, in the city of Albany and towns of Colonie and Guilderland.<ref>{{cite web | title = Enjoy the Albany/Capital District on snowshoes | url = http://www.albany.com/winter/snowshoeing.cfm | publisher = Albany.com | accessdate = 2009-06-09}}</ref>

==Culture and contemporary life==
Albany is often derided as "Smallbany" (also spelled Smalbany) for its perceived lack of culture and as a backwater in tourism circles,<ref>{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=JwvE1F2zyXoC&pg=PA184&dq=smallbany#PPA184,M1 | title = USA | page = 184 | publisher = Lonely Planet | year = 2008 | accessdate = 2009-06-01 | first = Jeff| last = Campbell | isbn = 978-1-74104-675-5}}</ref> even though it consistently ranks high on lists of top cities/metro areas for culture, such as being 23rd in the book ''Cities Ranked & Rated''.<ref>{{cite web | title = America's Top Cities for Culture | url = http://www.move.com/new-homes/real-estate-news/the-top-10-cultural-cities.aspx | publisher = Move, Inc. | accessdate = 2009-06-04}}</ref> To locals the Smallbany title references the perceived notion that all residents are interconnected and know each other in some way.  Albany is home to some of the oldest museums, historical sites, and places of worship in the state of New York and the United States; some of the finest collections of historical artifacts and art can be found in Albany County.

===Museums===
Albany County has many historical sites and museums covering a wide range of topics and time periods. The [[Albany Institute of History and Art]] founded in 1791 is one of the oldest museums in the United States,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/HTML/history.htm |title=The History of the Albany Institute of History from the 1700s to the Present |publisher=Albanyinstitute.org |date=1999-06-01 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref> and the [[New York State Museum]] is the oldest and largest state museum in the country.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/membership/ | title = Support the New York State Museum | publisher = New York State Museum | accessdate = 2009-05-30}}</ref> Many of the museums are historical sites themselves, such as Cherry Hill, the [[Ten Broeck Mansion]], and the [[Schuyler Mansion]] in the city of Albany and the Pruyn House in Colonie. The [[Quackenbush House]] is the second oldest house in the city of Albany and is part of the Albany Heritage Area Visitors Center, which includes a [[planetarium]]. The Albany Pine Bush Discovery Center in the city of Albany includes hands-on activities to learn about the unique [[Albany Pine Bush|Pine Bush]] Barrens of the city of Albany and towns of Guilderland and Colonie. Covering the history of pharmacy is the Throop Drug Store Museum at the [[Albany College of Pharmacy]]. The USS Slater, DE-766 is a World War II Destroyer Escort, the last floating Destroyer Escort, owned by the Destroyer Escort Historical Museum is moored from Spring to Fall at the foot of Quay Street in the Hudson River. The ship is open for tours each week and contains an excellent and well-maintained collection of World War II US Naval artifacts. www.ussslater.org

There are several art museums in Albany County; including the [[Albany Center Gallery]], in downtown Albany, which exhibits works by local artists within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of that city;<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = Albany Center Gallery | accessdate = 2009-11-25 | url = http://www.albanycentergallery.org/about/}}</ref> the [[University at Albany, SUNY#University Art Museum at University at Albany|University Art Museum]], at the [[University at Albany, SUNY]]; and the Opalka Gallery, at the [[Sage College of Albany]].

===Performing arts===
Albany County itself owns the largest venue for performing arts in the county, the [[Times Union Center]], which was originally built as the Knickerbocker Arena; it opened on January 30, 1990 with a performance by [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref>"Times Union enters a new arena". Carol DeMare. ''[[Times Union (Albany)|Times Union]]''. May 5, 2006</ref> In 1996, [[The Grateful Dead]] released a concert album from their March 1990 performances titled ''[[Dozin' at the Knick]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dead101.com/1045.htm |title=Dozin' at the Knick |publisher=Dead101.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}</ref>

===Sports===
Many athletes and coaches in major sports have begun their careers in Albany County. [[Phil Jackson]], former [[NBA]] head coach of the [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Los Angeles Lakers]] won his first championship ring as a coach when he guided the [[Albany Patroons]] to the 1984 CBA championship. Three years later, the Patroons completed a 50–6 regular season, including winning all 28 of their home games; at that time, [[Sacramento Kings]] head coach [[George Karl]] was the Patroons' head coach.  Future NBA stars [[Mario Elie]] and [[Vincent Askew]] were part of that season's squad. [[Mike Tyson]] received his early training in the Capital District and his first professional fight was in Albany in 1985 and Tyson's first televised fight was in Troy in 1986. He fought professionally four times in Albany and twice each in Troy and Glens Falls between 1985 and 1986.

Since 1988, the [[Siena College]] men's basketball team (the [[Siena Saints men's basketball|Siena Saints]]) have appeared in six [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournaments]] ([[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]], [[1999 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1999]], [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2002]], [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008]], [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], and [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010]]).

===Religious life===
Albany County was originally settled primarily by Protestants from northern Europe: the Netherlands, British Isles, and Germany. In the 19th century it was a destination for many Catholic immigrants, first from Ireland – fleeing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], and later from southern Germany, central and southern Europe. Late 19th and early 20th century immigrants included Jews from eastern Europe. In addition to other Jewish congregations, the county has one of the few [[Karaite Jewish]] communities outside Israel.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}  This community is active and has its own synagogue.<ref>[http://www.orahsaddiqim.org/ Orah Saddiqim website]</ref>

==Government and politics==
[[File:AlbanyCountyGovBldg.jpg|thumb|Albany County office building on State Street in Albany]]
Albany County was governed by an elected board of supervisors until 1967.

On January 1, 1968 a 39-member County Legislature was established. On January 1, 1976, Albany County government was changed by a new county charter establishing provisions for a [[county executive]] elected [[at-large]], in addition to the 39-seat county legislature.<ref>{{Cite news

==Transportation==
Albany County has long been at the forefront of transportation technology from the days of turnpikes and plank roads to the [[Erie Canal]], from the first passenger railroad in the state to the oldest municipal [[airport]] in the United States. Today, [[Interstates]], [[Amtrak]], and the [[Albany International Airport]] continue to make the Albany County a major crossroads of the [[Northeastern United States]].

The [[Capital District Transportation Committee]] (CDTC) is the [[Metropolitan Planning Organization]] (MPO) for the Albany-Schenectady-Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). Every metropolitan area in the United States with a population of over 50,000 must have a MPO in order to get any federal transportation funding. The [[US Department of Transportation]] (USDOT) uses an MPO to make decisions on what projects are most important to a metro area for immediate versus long term funding. The USDOT will not approve federal funds for transportation projects unless they are on an MPO's list.<ref name=CDTC>{{cite web | title = Capital District Transportation Committee | publisher = Capital District Transportation Committee | accessdate = 2009-04-23 | url = http://www.cdtcmpo.org/whatcdtc.htm}}</ref>

===Interstate and other major highways===
Albany County is situated at a major crossroads of the [[Northeastern United States]], first formed by the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. Even before the [[Interstate Highway System]] and the [[U.S. Highway]] system, Albany County was the hub of many [[Toll road|turnpikes]] and [[plank road]]s that connected the region, as well as the Erie Canal reaching the Great Lakes.

Today, [[Interstate 87]] and [[Interstate 90]] meet in Albany County. The [[Thomas E. Dewey Thruway|Thomas E. Dewey New York State Thruway]] is a [[toll-road]] that from Exit 24 in the city of Albany is I-87 and travels south to connect the county with [[downstate New York]]. West from Exit 24, the Thruway is I-90 and connects the county with [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], [[Utica, New York|Utica]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]].

North of Exit 24, I-87 is the [[Adirondack Northway]] and connects the city and county of Albany with their suburbs in [[Saratoga County, New York|Saratoga County]] and provides long-distance travel to [[Montreal]]. East of Exit 24, I-90 travels along the northern boundary of the city of Albany and exits the county on the [[Patroon Island Bridge]] into [[Rensselaer County, New York|Rensselaer County]] to access Albany's eastern suburbs. [[Interstate 787]] connects the Thruway (I-87) to [[Downtown Albany Historic District|Downtown Albany]], [[Menands, New York|Menands]], [[Watervliet, New York|Watervliet]], and [[Cohoes, New York|Cohoes]]. [[U.S. Route 9 in New York|U.S. Route 9]] enters the county on the [[Dunn Memorial Bridge]] and travels through the city of Albany north, connecting it with the suburbs in the [[Colonie, New York|Colonie]] and Saratoga County. [[U.S. Route 20 (New York)|U.S. Route 20]] also enters the county on the Dunn Memorial Bridge and travels west through Albany (city) and the Town of [[Guilderland, New York|Guilderland]]. [[New York State Route 5]] and [[New York State Route 7]] are two important highways that bisect the county and are developed as important shopping strips.

===Mass transit===
Albany County is served by the [[Capital District Transportation Authority]], a four-county bus service that also serves Rensselaer, Schenectady, and Saratoga counties. [[Greyhound Lines]], [[Trailways]], and [[Peter Pan Bus Lines|Peter Pan]]/Bonanza buses all serve a downtown terminal. A [[Chinatown bus]] service leaves from Central Avenue and provides service to Chinatown in [[Manhattan]].

===Airports===
[[Albany International Airport]] is the only commercial airport in the county. Destinations for flights out of Albany include [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]; Chicago; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]; and [[Orlando, Florida]], among many others.

===Rail===
Since 1968 when [[Union Station (Albany, New York)|Union Station]] in the city of Albany was abandoned for a new station across the Hudson in the city of [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]], Albany County has been without a train station. Amtrak has several routes serving the [[Albany-Rensselaer (Amtrak station)|Albany-Rensselaer Station]]. The [[Adirondack (Amtrak)|Adirondack]] (north to [[Montreal, Quebec]] and south to the city of New York), [[Empire Service (Amtrak)|Empire Service]] (west to Buffalo and Niagara Falls, south to New York), [[Ethan Allen Express (Amtrak)|Ethan Allen Express]] (northeast to [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]] and south to New York), [[Maple Leaf (Amtrak)|Maple Leaf]] (west to Toronto and south to New York), and the [[Lake Shore Limited (Amtrak)|Lake Shore Limited]] (at Albany-Rensselaer separate routes from Boston and New York merge to one train west to Chicago, on way east one train splits to two, one east to Boston and another south to New York).
