'''County Down''' (named after its [[county town]], [[Downpatrick]])<ref>Taylor, Isaac. ''Names and Their Histories''. Rivingtons, 1898. p.111</ref><ref>Lewis, Samuel. ''A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland'' (1837); [http://www.libraryireland.com/topog/D/See-of-Down.php "The See of Down"].</ref> is one of six [[Counties of Northern Ireland|counties]] that form [[Northern Ireland]], situated in the northeast of the [[island]] of [[Ireland]]. Adjoined to the southeast shore of [[Lough Neagh]], the county covers an area of 2,448&nbsp;km² (945 sq mi) and has a population of about 531,665. It is also one of the thirty-two traditional [[counties of Ireland]] and is within the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]].

The county was [[Archaism|archaically]] called '''Downshire'''. It borders [[County Antrim]] to the north, the [[Irish Sea]] to the east and south, [[County Armagh]] to the west, and [[County Louth]] across [[Carlingford Lough]] to the southwest. In the east of the county is [[Strangford Lough]] and the [[Ards Peninsula]]. The largest town is [[Bangor, County Down|Bangor]], on the northeast coast. Three other large towns and cities are on its border: [[Newry]] lies on the western border with County Armagh, while [[Lisburn]] and [[Belfast]] lie on the northern border with County Antrim. Down contains both the southernmost point of Northern Ireland ([[Cranfield Point]]) and the easternmost point of Ireland ([[Burr Point]]).

It is currently one of only two counties of Ireland to have a majority of the population from a [[Protestant]] background, according to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]]. The other is [[County Antrim]] to the north. However the main religion in south Down is Catholicism.  

== Geography ==
[[Image:Mournes wiki.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mourne Mountains]]
Down contains two significant [[peninsula]]s: [[Ards Peninsula]] and [[Lecale peninsula]].

The county has a coastline along [[Belfast Lough]] to the north and [[Carlingford Lough]] to the south (both of which have access to the sea). [[Strangford Lough]] lies between the Ards Peninsula and the mainland. Down also contains part of the shore of [[Lough Neagh]]. Smaller loughs include [[Lough Island Reavy]].

The [[River Lagan]] forms most of the border with County Antrim. The [[River Bann]] also flows through the southwestern areas of the county. Other rivers include the [[Newry River|Clanrye]] and [[River Quoile|Quoile]].

There are several islands off the Down coast: Mew Island, Light House Island and the [[Copeland Islands]], all of which lie to the north of the Ards Peninsula. Gunn Island lies off the Lecale coast. In addition there are a large number of small islands in Strangford Lough.

County Down is where, in the words of the famous song by [[Percy French]], "[[Mourne Mountains|The mountains of Mourne]] sweep down to the sea", and the [[granite]] Mourne Mountains continue to be renowned for their beauty. [[Slieve Donard]], at {{convert|849|m|0|abbr=on}}, is the highest peak in the Mournes, in Northern Ireland and in the province of Ulster. Another important peak is [[Slieve Croob]], at {{convert|534|m|0|abbr=on}}, the source of the River Lagan.

==History==
During the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] (1689-1691) the county was a centre of Protestant rebellion against the rule of the Catholic [[James II of Ireland|James II]]. After forming a scratch force the Protestants were defeated by the [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]] at the [[Break of Dromore]] and forced to retreat, leading to the whole of Down falling under [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] control. Later the same year [[Marshal Schomberg]]'s large [[Williamite]] expedition arrived in Belfast Lough and captured Bangor. After laying [[Siege of Carrickfergus (1689)|Siege to Carrickfergus]] Schomberg marched south to [[Dundalk Camp]] clearing County Down and much of the rest of East Ulster of Jacobite troops.

The county is named in the lyrics of the song "[[Around the World (1956 song)|Around The World]]", from the film ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'', which was an American top ten hit for [[Bing Crosby]] and UK top ten hit for [[Ronnie Hilton]], both in 1957, although it was [[Mantovani]]'s instrumental version which was actually used in the film. [[Rihanna]]'s video "[[We Found Love]]" was filmed there in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Northern Irish singer [[Van Morrison]] has made reference to the County Down in the lyrics to several songs including "Northern Muse (Solid Ground)," "Mystic of the East" and the nostalgic "[[Coney Island (song)|Coney Island]]" which names several places and landmarks in the County.
