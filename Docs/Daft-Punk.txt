They rarely grant interviews or appear on television.

Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were originally in a rock band called [[Darlin' (French band)|Darlin']] together, which disbanded after a short period of time, leaving the two to experiment musically with drum machines and synthesizers. The duo became Daft Punk, releasing their debut album ''[[Homework (Daft Punk album)|Homework]]'' on [[Virgin Records]] in 1997 to highly positive reviews. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by [[Pedro Winter]] (Busy P), the head of [[Ed Banger Records]].<ref name="Pedro" /> The 2001 release of ''[[Discovery (Daft Punk album)|Discovery]]'' was even more successful, driven by the club singles "[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]", "[[Digital Love]]", and "[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]". In March 2005, the duo released the album ''[[Human After All]]'' to mixed reviews. However, the singles "[[Robot Rock (song)|Robot Rock]]" and "[[Technologic]]" achieved success in the United Kingdom.

Daft Punk [[Alive 2006/2007|toured throughout 2006 and 2007]] and released the live album ''[[Alive 2007]]'', which won a [[Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album]]. The duo composed the score of the film ''[[Tron: Legacy]]'' in 2010 and released [[Tron: Legacy (soundtrack)|its soundtrack album]]. In January 2013, Daft Punk left Virgin Records for [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s subsidiary label [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], and released ''[[Random Access Memories]]'' in 2013 to worldwide critical acclaim. The album's lead single "[[Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)|Get Lucky]]" became an international success, peaking in the top 10 in 32 countries. ''Random Access Memories'' led to five Grammy wins in 2014, including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] as well as [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] for "Get Lucky".

==History==

===1987–93: Early career===
[[Thomas Bangalter]] and [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]] met in 1987 while attending the [[Lycée Carnot]], a secondary school in Paris.<ref name="MusiqueVol.1">[http://web.archive.org/web/20060410194554/http://www.daft-musique.com/ Daft Punk Musique Vol. 1 Official Website].

This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group called [[Darlin' (French band)|Darlin']] with [[Laurent Brancowitz]] in 1992.<ref name="DarlinBio" /> Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums.<ref name="FrenchConn">James, Martin.

It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it."<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> A negative review in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' by Dave Jennings<ref>{{cite web| title=Blog post by Ned Raggett |url=http://nedraggett.tumblr.com/post/50466658963/and-why-you-ask-am-i-showing-you-this-photo-of-a |last1=Raggett |first1=Ned |date= 14 May 2013 |work= [[Ned Raggett]]'s Blog |accessdate=14 May 2013}}</ref> subsequently dubbed the music "a [[wiktionary:daft|daft]] [[punk rock|punky]] thrash."<ref>"Review of Shimmies in Super 8."

===1993–99: ''Homework''===
[[File:Muzik (magazine).jpg|thumb|rights|''[[Muzik]]'' magazine cover feature in February 1997]]
In September 1993, Daft Punk attended a [[rave]] at [[Disneyland Resort Paris|EuroDisney]], where they met Stuart Macmillan of [[Slam (band)|Slam]], co-founder of the label [[Soma Quality Recordings]].<ref name="RFI Musique" /> The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk's debut single, "[[The New Wave (song)|The New Wave]]", a limited release in 1994.<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> The single also contained the final mix of "The New Wave" called "Alive", which was to be featured on Daft Punk's first album.

Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record "[[Da Funk]]". It became the duo's first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of "Da Funk", Daft Punk looked to find a manager. The duo eventually settled on [[Pedro Winter]], who regularly promoted it and other artists at his Hype night clubs.<ref name="FrenchConn"/> The band signed with [[Virgin Records]] in September 1996 and made a deal through which the duo licensed its tracks to the major label through its production company, Daft Trax.<ref name="MusiqueVol.1" /><ref name="FrenchConn"/> Bangalter spoke of the duo's decision to sign with Virgin:

{{quote|Many record companies offered us deals. They came from everywhere, but we decided to wait—partly because we didn't want to lose control of what we had created. We turned down many record companies. We weren't interested in the money, so we turned down labels that were looking for more control than we were willing to give up. In reality, we're more like partners with Virgin.<ref name="Yahoo">{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/interview/12052857|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809052134/http://music.yahoo.com/read/interview/12052857|archivedate=9 August 2007 |title=Yahoo! Music – Interviews|publisher=Yahoo! Music |date=30 December 2010 |accessdate=3 January 2011}}</ref>}}

With regard to the artistic control and freedom, Bangalter stated:

{{Quote|We've got much more control than money. You can't get everything. We live in a society where money is what people want, so they can't get the control. We chose. Control is freedom. People say we're control freaks, but control is controlling your destiny without controlling other people. We're not trying to manipulate other people, just controlling what we do ourselves. Controlling what we do is being free. People should stop thinking that an artist that controls what he does is a bad thing. A lot of artists today are just victims, not having control, and they're not free. And that's pathetic. If you start being dependent on money, then money has to reach a point to fit your expenses.<ref name="Yahoo"/>}}

"Da Funk" and "Alive" were later included on Daft Punk's [[1997 in music|1997 debut album]] ''[[Homework (Daft Punk album)|Homework]]''. In February of that year, the UK dance magazine ''[[Muzik]]'' published a Daft Punk cover feature and described ''Homework'' as "one of the most hyped debut albums in a long long time."<ref>Bush, C. (1997), Frog Rock, ''[[Muzik]]'', IPC Magazines Ltd, London, Issue No.21 February 1997.</ref> According to ''[[The Village Voice]]'', the album revived house music and departed from the [[Eurodance]] formula.<ref name="vv">Woods, Scott (5 October 1999). [http://www.villagevoice.com/1999-10-05/music/underground-disco/ "Underground Disco?"]. ''[[The Village Voice]]''. Retrieved 10 February 2012.</ref> As noted by critic Alex Rayner, ''Homework'' brought together established club styles and the "burgeoning eclecticism" of [[big beat]].<ref name="1001albums">Rayner, Alex (2006). ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''. p. 812. New York, NY: [[Universe Publishing]]. 2006. ISBN 0-7893-1371-5. Retrieved 8 May 2012.</ref> The most successful single from ''Homework'' was "[[Around the World (Daft Punk song)|Around the World]]", which is known for the repeating chant of the song's title. "Da Funk" was also included on ''[[The Saint (film)|The Saint]]'' film soundtrack. Daft Punk produced a series of music videos for ''Homework'' directed by [[Spike Jonze]], [[Michel Gondry]], [[Roman Coppola]] and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled ''[[D.A.F.T.: A Story About Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes]]''.

===1999–2004: ''Discovery''===
By 1999, the duo was well into the recording sessions for its second album, which had begun a year earlier.<ref name=PitchforkOuttakes>{{cite web|last=Dombal|first=Ryan|title=Daft Punk: Cover Story Outtakes|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/50746-daft-punk-cover-story-outtakes/|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|accessdate=15 May 2013|date=15 May 2013}}</ref><ref name="MTVeInterview" /> The 2001 release of ''[[Discovery (Daft Punk album)|Discovery]]'' took on a slicker and distinctly [[synthpop]]-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk's previous material in ''Homework''. The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood.<ref name="ROBOPOP">Chris Gill, [http://remixmag.com/mag/remix_robopop/ "ROBOPOP"] (May 2001) ''Remix Magazine Online''. Retrieved 6 March 2007.</ref> This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late '70s to early '80s era on the album. The album reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom, and its single, "[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]", was a major club and mainstream hit that nearly topped the UK Singles Chart. The song is well known for being heavily [[Auto-Tune|autotune]]d and [[Dynamic range compression|compressed]].<ref name="ROBOPOP" /> The song and album created a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles "[[Digital Love]]" and "[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]" were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart. "Digital Love" was subsequently covered by the bands Kodaline and Hellogoodbye. The song "[[Face to Face (Daft Punk song)|Face to Face]]" hit No. 1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release.<ref>{{cite web |title= Face to Face (Rare Remixes!)|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/260250|work= biography|publisher=[[discogs]]|accessdate=3 October 2008}}</ref> A 45-minute excerpt from a ''Daftendirektour'' performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, titled ''[[Alive 1997]]''.
The year 2003 saw the release of the feature-length animated film, ''[[Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem]]''. Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of [[Leiji Matsumoto]], who is their childhood hero.<ref name="5555Insert">''[[Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem]]'' companion leaflet (2003)</ref> The album ''[[Daft Club]]'' was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name.

===2004–08: ''Human After All'' ===
[[File:Daft Punk 2007.jpg|thumb|Daft Punk performing in [[Berkeley, California]] on 27 July 2007]]
Starting on 13 September and ending on 9 November 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to the creation of new material.<ref>''Human After All'' liner notes (2005). Retrieved 17 December 2007.</ref> The duo later released the resulting album ''[[Human After All]]'' in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were "[[Robot Rock (song)|Robot Rock]]", "[[Technologic]]", "[[Human After All (song)|Human After All]]", and "[[The Prime Time of Your Life]]". The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was "we believe that ''Human After All'' speaks for itself."

A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD titled ''[[Musique Vol. 1 1993–2005]]'' was released on 4 April 2006. It contains music videos for "Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)" and "The Prime Time of Your Life" directed by Daft Punk and [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner]], respectively. Daft Punk also released a [[remix album]] of ''Human After All'' called ''[[Human After All: Remixes]]''. A limited edition included two [[kubrick (toy)|kubricks]] of Daft Punk as robots.

On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered its first directed film, ''[[Daft Punk's Electroma]]'', at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] sidebar Director's Fortnight.<ref name="ElectromaReview">[http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=features2006&content=jump&jump=review&dept=cannes&nav=RCannes&articleid=VE1117930614&cs=1 ''Daft Punk's Electroma'' review] ''Variety''.

In April 2015, Daft Punk appeared in a short tribute to Nile Rodgers as part of a documentary on Rodgers' life titled "Nile Rodgers: From Disco to Daft Punk". In the short clip, the two send a "transmission" to Rodgers with the message, "''Dear Nile, We are sending you this transmission to thank you for all your amazing songs. Your music continues to inspire the world... With love, Daft Punk''".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Camp|first1=Zoe|title=Daft Punk Make Tribute Video for Nile Rodgers|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/58497-daft-punk-make-tribute-video-for-nile-rodgers/|website=Pitchfork.com|publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc.|accessdate=27 April 2015}}</ref>

Later in 2015, a documentary on Daft Punk titled ''[[Daft Punk Unchained]]'' was released. The film covers Daft Punk's music career from the 1990s up to and including their 2014 Grammy appearance. The documentary features interviews with Nile Rodgers, Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, and others who have interacted with the duo in their projects.

==Influences==
Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing [[electronic music]] as a duo, they shared tastes for [[Elton John]], [[MC5]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Stooges]].<ref name="DarlinBio">{{cite web |title=Darlin' |url= http://www.discogs.com/artist/Darlin'|publisher= [[discogs]] |accessdate=20 February 2007}}</ref><ref>''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' (March 2005).</ref> Bangalter recalled that the records motivated him to learn English as a second language, since he wanted to understand the lyrics.<ref name="lesinrocks2013">''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' No. 910 (May 2013).</ref> The duo's mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own indie group called [[Darlin' (French band)|Darlin']]. Bangalter explained: "It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It's like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band."<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997">Matthew Collin, [http://www.techno.de/mixmag/97.08/DaftPunk.a.html "Do You Think You Can Hide From Stardom?"] (August 1997) ''[[Mixmag]]''. Retrieved 6 March 2007. {{wayback|url=http://www.techno.de/mixmag/97.08/DaftPunk.a.html |date=20141106141054 |df=y }}</ref> They also drew inspiration from the rock and [[acid house]] in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo referred to ''[[Screamadelica]]'' by [[Primal Scream]] as the record that "put everything together" in terms of genre".<ref name="Mixmag 2006" />

The liner notes of ''Homework'' pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contain a quote from [[Brian Wilson]]. Bangalter stated: "In Brian Wilson's music you could really feel the beauty—it was very spiritual. Like [[Bob Marley]], too."<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> When questioned on the success of Daft Punk's debut album and the rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, "before us you had [[Frankie Knuckles]] or [[Juan Atkins]] and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people."<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997" /> The Daft Punk track "Teachers", from ''Homework'', refers to several influences, such as [[Romanthony]] and [[Todd Edwards]]. De Homem-Christo stated: "Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions—the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony's voice, the emotion and soul—is part of how we sound today."<ref name="ROBOPOP" /> A 2011 Bodytonic podcast featured tracks from all of the artists named in "Teachers", the Brian Wilson speech quoted in the liner notes of ''Homework'', and a Kraftwerk-like 1983 track produced by [[Daniel Vangarde]], father of Bangalter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/ck303/theprequel96 |title=Daft Punk 'Teachers' mix Vol II, 88 tracks (1977–1997) that inspired 'Homework' by CK303 on SoundCloud – Hear the world's sounds |publisher=Soundcloud.com |accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>

Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk on tracks for ''Discovery''. For the album, Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the [[Aphex Twin]] single "[[Windowlicker]]", which was "neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track", according to Bangalter.<ref name="MTVeInterview">[http://web.archive.org/web/20060327234551/http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=40 "Daft Punk Embark On A Voyage of Discovery"] MTVe.com.

As stated by de Homem-Christo, "On 'Digital Love' you get this [[Supertramp]] vibe on the bridge," which was generated through an in-studio [[Wurlitzer electric piano|Wurlitzer piano]].<ref name="mixonlineinterview">Bryan Reesman, [http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_daft_punk/ Daft Punk interview] ''Mix (magazine)''.

Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from ''Homework'' featured distinctive characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance.<ref name="Canoe"/> The album ''Discovery'' subsequently became the soundtrack to ''Interstella 5555''.

Their outward personas have also changed over time. In one of the duo's earliest magazine appearances, de Homem-Christo stated in a ''[[Jockey Slut]]'' interview that, "We don't want to be photographed. [...] We don't especially want to be in magazines. We have a responsibility." Although they allowed a camera crew to film them for a French television arts program at the time, Daft Punk did not wish to speak on screen "because it is dangerous."<ref name="Jockey">''[[Jockey Slut]]'' Vol. 2, No. 1 (April/May 1996). page 55.</ref> During their ''Homework'' years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance.<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997"/> When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in ''[[The Work of Director Michel Gondry]]'' DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Few official photos of the duo's faces exist, including a blurry one found in the ''Homework'' liner notes.

In their more visible ''Discovery'' years, they appeared wearing robotic headgear and metallic gloves for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. The helmets were produced by Paul Hahn of Daft Arts and the French directors [[Alex and Martin]], the duo who also designed them.<ref name="DailySwarm">Diehl, Matt.

Retrieved 14 April 2007.</ref> Thomas Bangalter once stated, "''We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09&nbsp;am on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots''."<ref name="ROBOPOP"/>

Daft Punk have said that they donned their robot outfits to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZeRqcTO_do Daft Punk interview in Japan (1/2)]. Retrieved 14 November 2012.</ref> However, Bangalter later stated that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. "But then it became exciting from the audience's point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower."<ref name="Mixmag 2006">Suzanne Ely, "Return of the Cybermen" ''Mixmag'', July 2006, pp. 94–98.</ref> When asked whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated "No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of [[glam rock|glam]], where it's definitely not you."<ref name="Mixmag 2006" /> With the release of ''Human After All'', the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of black leather jacket and pants and simplified versions of the ''Discovery'' headgear. The attire was designed by [[Hedi Slimane]].<ref name="Mixmag 2006" /> Bangalter stated that, "We never like to do the same thing twice. It's more fun and entertaining for us to do something different, whether it's wearing masks or developing a persona that merges fiction and reality. We're happy to give back to the masses".<ref name="ROBOPOP" />

According to Bangalter, the duo has a "general rule about not appearing in videos." Although Daft Punk rarely grants interviews, Bangalter is cited as being the more talkative and opinionated one of the duo. With regard to fame and stardom, he said:

{{Cquote|We don't believe in the [[celebrity|star system]]. We want the focus to be on the music. If we have to create an image, it must be an artificial image. That combination hides our physicality and also shows our view of the star system. It is not a compromise.<ref name="Canoe">[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/D/Daft_Punk/1997/04/12/744419.html CANOE – JAM! Music – Artists – Daft Punk: Who are those masked men?] canoe.ca.

We're trying to separate the private side and the public side. It's just that we're a little bit embarrassed by the whole thing. We don't want to play this star system thing. We don't want to get recognised in the streets. Yes. Everyone has accepted us using masks in photos so far, which makes us happy. Maybe sometimes people are a little bit disappointed but that's the only way we want to do it. We think the music is the most personal thing we can give. The rest is just about people taking themselves seriously, which is all very boring sometimes.<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997"/>}}

In the same interview, he was also asked a question if stardom can be avoided.

{{Cquote|Yes. I think people understand what we are doing. I know many people who maybe like the way we are handling things. People understand that you don't need to be on the covers of magazines with your face to make good music. Painters or other artists, you don't know them but you know what they are doing. We are very happy that the concept in itself is becoming famous. In France, you speak of Daft Punk and I'm sure millions of people have heard it, but less than a few thousand people know our face—which is the thing we're into. We control it, but it's not us physically, our persons. We don't want to run into people who are the same age as us, shaking our hand and saying, 'Can I have your autograph?' because we think we're exactly like them. Even girls, they can fall in love with your music, but not with you. You don't always have to compromise yourself to be successful. The playing with masks is just to make it funnier. Pictures can be boring. We don't want all the [[rock and roll|rock n' roll]] poses and attitudes—they are completely stupid and ridiculous today.<ref name="Interview at Mixmag 1997"/>}}

During the filming and promotion of ''Daft Punk's Electroma'', the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview.<ref>[http://www.twitchfilm.net/archives/007781.html Daft Punk Talk Electroma.

In 1997 they did their ''[[Daftendirektour]]'' to promote ''Homework'' in several cities throughout the world.
