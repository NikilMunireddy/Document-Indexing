'''ABS-CBN''' (an [[initialism]] of the network's former names, '''Alto Broadcasting System - Chronicle Broadcasting Network''') is a [[Television in the Philippines|Filipino]] [[commercial broadcasting|commercial broadcast]] [[television network]] that is the flagship property of [[ABS-CBN Corporation]], a company under [[Lopez Group of Companies|Lopez Group]]. The network is headquartered at the [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center]] in [[Quezon City]], with additional offices and production facilities in 25 major cities including [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]], and [[Davao City|Davao]]. ABS-CBN is formally referred to as '''"The ''Kapamilya'' Network"''', a [[Tagalog language|Filipino]] word which means a member of a family, and was originally introduced in 2003 during the celebration of the 50th year anniversary of Philippine television. It is the largest television network in the country in terms of revenues, assets, and international coverage.

ABS-CBN is the oldest television broadcaster in [[Southeast Asia]] and one of the oldest commercial television broadcaster in [[Asia]]. It is also the [[List of most watched television broadcasts#Philippines|leading television network in the Philippines]] with advertising revenues of 21.2 billion [[Philippine peso|pesos]] for the fiscal year of 2015.<ref name="ABS-CBN">{{cite report|url=http://edge.pse.com.ph/downloadFile.do?file_id=228352|title=SEC FORM 17-A 2015|publisher=[[Philippine Stock Exchange]]|date=March 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name="owners">{{cite report|last = P.

It is also the first television network in Southeast Asia to broadcast in color, the first television network in the Philippines to formally launch a digital terrestrial television service, and the first broadcast television network in the Philippines to formally launch in high-definition. 

Today, the flagship [[television station]] of ABS-CBN is [[DWWX-TV]] (ABS-CBN TV-2 Manila). The network operates across the Philippine archipelago through its [[Regional Network Group|ABS-CBN Regional]] division which controls 80 television stations.<ref name="ABS-CBN"/><ref>{{cite press release|last=Cerrado|first=Aldrin|url=http://www.pse.com.ph/resource/corpt/2013/ABS_A17A_Dec2012_1.pdf|title=ABS-CBN Corporation Amended 2012 SEC Form 17-A|date=5 June 2013|work=Philippine Stock Exchange}}</ref> Its programs are also available outside the Philippines through the global subscription television channel [[The Filipino Channel]] (TFC) which is now available in over three million paying households worldwide as well as terrestrially in [[Guam]] through [[ KEQI-LP]]. Since 2011, the network is on test broadcast for [[digital terrestrial television]] using the Japanese standard [[ISDB-T]] in select areas in the Philippines. On October 3, 2015, ABS-CBN started to broadcast in [[high-definition television|high-definition]] on select direct-to-home cable television providers and later on direct-to-home satellite television.

==History==
[[Image:Family theater philippines.gif|220px|thumb|left|Scene from ''What every Woman Knows'' on ''Family Theater'' of [[Patrick Peyton|Fr. Patrick Peyton, CSC]], a live stage drama aired on ABS-CBN in the Philippines in 1962. Center is [[Jaime Zobel de Ayala|Jaime Zóbel de Ayala]], who acted in his younger years and later becoming the chairman of [[Ayala Corporation]].]]
ABS-CBN traces its history to the first Philippine television station [[DZAQ-TV]], owned by Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC) which was later renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS).

James Lindenberg, owner of BEC, was the first to apply for a license to the [[Philippine Congress]] to establish a television station in 1949. His request was granted on 14 June 1950. Because of the strict import controls and the lack of raw materials needed to open a TV station in the Philippines during the mid-20th century, Lindenberg branched to radio broadcasting instead.<ref name="history">{{cite web|last=Anastacio|first=Ellen Joy|last2=Badiola|first2=Janine Natalie|title=The History of Philippine Television|url=http://pinoytv.blogspot.com/|publisher=UP-CMC Broadcast Department|date=1 January 2010|accessdate=6 April 2012}}</ref>

Judge Antonio Quirino, brother of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Elpidio Quirino]], also tried to apply for a license to Congress, but was denied. He later purchased stocks from BEC and subsequently gained the controlling stock to rename the company from BEC to Alto Broadcasting System (ABS).

DZAQ-TV began commercial television operations on 23 October 1953; the first fully licensed commercial television station in the Philippines. The first program to air was a garden party at the Quirino residence in Sitio Alto, San Juan. After the premiere telecast, the station followed a four-hour-a-day schedule, from six to ten in the evening.<ref name="history"/>

In 1955, Manila Chronicle owner [[Eugenio Lopez, Sr.]] and former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Fernando Lopez]], acquired a radio-TV franchise from the [[Philippine Congress|Congress]] and immediately established Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) in 1956. On 24 February 1957 Lopez invited Judge Quirino to his house for breakfast and ABS was bought under a contract written on a table napkin. The corporate name was reverted to Bolinao Electronics Corporation immediately after the purchase of ABS.<ref name="history"/>

With the establishment of DZXL-TV 9 of CBN in 1956, the Lopez brothers controlled both television channels in the archipelago, culminating in the first wave of expansion. The monopoly in television was broken in 1961, when [[DZBB-TV|DZBB-TV 7]] was established by the [[GMA Network#Republic Broadcasting System|Republic Broadcasting System]] (now [[GMA Network, Inc.]]) (RBS), owned by [[Robert Stewart (entrepreneur)|Robert Stewart]], on the same year it launched the nation's first regional and provincial television station in [[Cebu City]] on 24 July.<ref name="history"/>

In 1967, the company was renamed ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. This company became the formal merger of the two stations DZAQ-TV 3 (ABS) and DZXL-TV  9 (CBN).

In 1966, ABS-CBN became the first TV network to broadcast certain shows in color by using the American [[NTSC]] standard and by 18 December 1968, ABS-CBN opened its present-day Broadcast Center complex in Bohol Avenue, Quezon City. It was among the most advanced broadcasting facility of its kind in Asia. Full color broadcasts began in 1971 (8 hours a day) on ABS-CBN 2 with the availability of more color television sets around Manila and neighboring municipalities and cities.<ref name="history"/>

In 1969, DZAQ-TV transferred to channel 2 (which remains as the current positioning frequency of the flagship station in Metro Manila), while its sister station DZXL-TV transferred to channel 4. This frequency adjustment was done to make room for Kanlaon Broadcasting System (now [[Radio Philippines Network]]) to occupy the channel 9 frequency.

[[File:Abscbn broadcast center.jpg|thumb|right|330px|The [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center]] in Diliman, [[Quezon City]], the headquarters of ABS-CBN.]]
When then [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] declared [[martial law]] in 1972, the station was forced to shut down. The company was seized from the Lopez brothers and its newly built Broadcast Center became the home of state-run TV stations [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC Channel 2, with call sign changed to DWWX-TV), [[People's Television Network|Government Television]] ([[DWGT-TV|GTV Channel 4]], with call sign changed to DWGT-TV and later renamed MBS-4), [[Radio Philippines Network|Kanlaon Broadcasting System]] ([[DZKB-TV|KBS Channel 9]]) and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] ([[DZTV-TV|IBC Channel 13]]).<ref name="history"/>

The long hibernation of the station ended on February 1986. As the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA revolt]] broke out in the eighties, and Marcos' grip on power debilitated, the reformists in the military contended the broadcasting network would be a vital asset for victory. Thus, at 10 AM on February 24, they attacked and took the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center that was then the home of MBS-4.<ref name="history"/>

When Marcos was deposed, the network was sequestered and returned Channel 2 to the Lopezes but not Channel 4. On 14 September 1986, ABS-CBN went back on the air, broadcasting from what used to be their main garage at Broadcast Center in the pre-Martial Law days. The network was forced to share space in the building that was rightfully their own with the government TV station Channel 4. At the time, money had been scarce while resources were limited; offices were used as dressing rooms and other equipment such as chairs, tables, and phones were in short supply.<ref name="history"/>

In late 1986, the network was faltering, ranking last among the five stations in the Philippines and was suffering heavy losses. [[Geny Lopez|Eugenio "Geny" Lopez Jr.]] by early 1987 brought in programming whiz and ABS-CBN veteran Freddie Garcia, then working for [[GMA Network]], and set him loose to work his magic touch.

Six months later on 1 March 1987, Channel 2 was relaunched with the live musical special, "The Star Network: ''Ang Pagbabalik Ng Bituin''" (The Return of the Star). In 1988, ABS-CBN was topping the Mega Manila ratings, a position it had never relinquished for 16 years.

Later that year, the station launched nationwide domestic satellite programming and by 1994, expanded its operations worldwide. In 1999, Channel 2 launched its 120-kilowatt [[Millennium Transmitter]], resulting in improved signal quality throughout Mega Manila.

In  2005, ABS-CBN re-upgraded its transmitter into a very high capacity of 346.2 kilowatts resulting on a much clearer signal in Metro Manila.

During the historic [[2010 Philippine presidential election]], in response to the first automation of the  election in the country, ABS-CBN utilized a technology from [[Ormat Industries#Orad|Orad Hi Tech Systems Ltd.]] that utilizes the principles of [[augmented reality]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sanchez|first=Rowena Joy|title=TV networks war over holograms and virtual presence|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/257307/tv-networks-war-over-holograms-and-virtual-presence|publisher=''[[Manila Bulletin]]''|date=14 May 2010|accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> The technology uses real-time image processing system for live broadcasts of 3D [[computer-generated imagery]] against a real set or background. ABS-CBN also utilized what is probably the biggest [[touch screen|touch screen display]] to be used in a Philippine television show. A new set dubbed as the "WAR" (Wireless Audience Response) room was specifically designed for the said election coverage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almo|first=Nerisa|title=ABS-CBN encourages Filipinos to be citizen journalists|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/guide/6036/abs-cbn-encourages-filipinos-to-be-citizen-journalists|publisher=''[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]''|date=8 May 2010|accessdate=2 July 2012}}</ref> The coverage of ABS-CBN became the third top trending topic worldwide on the social networking site [[Twitter]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Chui|first=Angie|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/259304/ab|title=ABS-CBN, partners make milestone in poll coverage|publisher=''[[The Manila Bulletin]]''|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/anc/05/10/10/anc-taps-social-media-halalan-2010|title=ANC taps social media halalan 2010|publisher=''[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]]''|date=10 May 2010|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref>

==Competition==
Since its inception in 1953 until 1961, ABS-CBN (then Alto Broadcasting System) was the only commercial television network in the country. It was only until the 1960s that television became common and at that time, although [[audience measurement]] has not yet invented, ABS was favored by giant companies such as [[Procter and Gamble]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], [[Unilever]], [[Nestlé]], [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[Pepsico]] and [[Caltex]]. ABS-CBN was the only Philippine television network to air commercials and was only the advertising partner of [[Colgate-Palmolive]] products from 2000 until 15 years later in 2015, when other networks returned to air the Colgate-Palmolive commercials such as rival [[GMA Network]]. When the [[martial law]] was declared, ABS-CBN and other television networks were forced to shut-down and held control by the Government. When it was re-established in 1986 as a commercial television, it had failed to regain its glory days and was ranked behind among the five television networks. It was not until 1987, when it was re-branded as "The Star Network" that it had slowly regained its foothold in TV ratings. In 1992, [[AGB Nielsen Philippines]] was founded and a new pace in television history was introduced. In 2007, TNS Philippines started to offer media research through [[Kantar Media Philippines]] (formerly Kantar/TNS). In 2008, AGB Nielsen Philippines released the [[List of most watched television broadcasts#Philippines|all-time highest rating shows in the Philippines]], with 7 of the top 10 highest rating shows all from ABS-CBN with the shows like ''The Battle: Pacquiao vs. Morales'', ''[[Rosalinda (telenovela)|Rosalinda]]'', ''[[Esperanza (TV series)|Esperanza]]'', ''[[Meteor Garden]]'', ''[[Pangako sa 'Yo]]'', ''[[Miss Universe 1994]]'', and ''[[Maria Mercedes (telenovela)|Maria Mercedes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nathan|title=30 All-Time Highest-rated Philippine TV shows based from the overnight ratings tabulation of AGB Nielsen Philippines in Mega Manila as of February 2008|url=http://kuwaderno.com/30-all-time-highest-rated-philippine-tv-shows-based-from-the-overnight-ratings-tabulation-of-agb-nielsen-philippines-in-mega-manila-as-of-february-2008.html|publisher=Kwuaderno|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=1 July 2012}}</ref> At the turn of the first decade of the century, competition was up against its closest competitor [[GMA Network]] and [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]]. Moreover, the data released by AGB Nielsen show the Mega Manila data, which favors GMA in the Mega Manila ratings while Kantar Media releases the Total Philippines ratings (National Urban and Rural Households), which favors ABS-CBN.

==Controversies and scandals==

{{main|AGB Nielsen Philippine TV ratings controversy}}

In late 2007, ABS-CBN accused [[AGB Nielsen Philippines]] of tampering with the ratings during their 2007 ratings surveys.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2007/dec/20/yehey/top_stories/20071220top1.html|work=manilatimes.net|title=GMA 7 tagged in scandal|date=2007-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Godinez|first=Bong|title=Quezon City court issues TRO against AGB Nielsen|url=http://www.pep.ph/news/15826/FIRST-READ-ON-PEP:-Quezon-City-court-issues-TRO-against-AGB-Nielsen|date=20 December 2007|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> On 8 January 2008, Quezon City regional trial court (RTC) junked ABS-CBN's case against AGB Nielsen saying it was prematurely filed.

===Writ of Amparo===
On 22 January 2008, Asia-Pacific Director Jacqueline Park of the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) supported the petition for [[Amparo and habeas data in the Philippines|writ of amparo]] filed by the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation's 11 employees (led by [[Ces Oreña-Drilon]]) with the Supreme Court to rule on the legality of [[journalist]]s' [[arrests]] concerning the failed [[Manila Peninsula rebellion]]. It stated: "We support employees from ABS-CBN in standing up for their democratic rights to work free from harassment and intimidation, especially from government officials and authorities." Meanwhile, the Supreme Court required the respondents to file comment to the amparo petition within 10 days. Further, Harry Roque, National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP)'s [[lawyer]] announced its filing of a class [[lawsuit]] for [[injunction]] with [[damages]] (Article 33, New [[Civil Code]] of the [[Philippines]]) against the [[Philippine National Police]], among others.
