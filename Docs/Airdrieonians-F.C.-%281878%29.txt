'''Airdrieonians Football Club''', more commonly known as '''Airdrie''', were a Scottish professional [[association football|football]] team from the town of [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]], in the [[Monklands (district)|Monklands]] area of [[Lanarkshire]].

The club became defunct at the end of the [[Scottish Football League]] 2001–02 season, despite the team finishing as [[runner-up|runners-up]] in the [[Scottish Football League|SFL]] [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] to [[Partick Thistle F.C.|Partick Thistle]] and therefore only narrowly missing out on promotion to the [[Scottish Premier League]].

During their 124-year existence the "Diamonds", as they were nicknamed, won the old [[Scottish Division Two]] three times, the [[Spring Cup]] once and the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] on three occasions. The club also competed in four separate [[Scottish Cup]] finals; winning the competition in 1924.

Airdrieonians were the first club in the [[Scottish Football League|Scottish League]] to fold since 1967, when [[Third Lanark A.C.|Third Lanark]] went bankrupt.

==History==

===Formation and early years===
The team was founded in [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]], North Lanarkshire in 1878 as '''Excelsior Football Club''', changing its name to Airdrieonians in 1881. It was elected to the [[Scottish Football League]] in [[1894–95 in Scottish football|1894]].<ref name = "Crampsey29">{{harvnb|Crampsey|1990|p=29}}</ref>

The club enjoyed its most successful era in the 1920s, following the signing of [[Hughie Gallacher]] from [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]] in 1921. Airdrie challenged the dominance of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]],<ref name = "Crampsey71"/> as they finished in second place in the Scottish League championship four years in a row between 1923 and 1926 and won the [[Scottish Cup]] in 1924. Following this victory, in early summer 1925, the club visited [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]], and made a big impression. Translations of local newspaper reports, and some photographs of the tour, are still available.<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/space/airdrie/ "Airdrieonians in Norway/Sweden 1925"]</ref> This successful era came to an end after Gallacher and [[Bob McPhail]] were sold to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and Rangers respectively.<ref name = "Crampsey71">{{harvnb|Crampsey|1990|p=71}}</ref>

===Post war era and beyond===

Airdrie spent much of the post war era "[[yo-yo club|yo-yoing]]" between the top flight and [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. Airdrie entered the first [[Texaco Cup]] competition in [[1970–71 in Scottish football|1970–71]],<ref name = "Crampsey183">{{harvnb|Crampsey|1990|p=183}}</ref> defeating [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the first round.<ref name = "Crampsey184"/> That tie was decided by a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] and Airdrie became the first Scottish club to be involved in that method of deciding a contest.<ref name = "Crampsey184">{{harvnb|Crampsey|1990|p=184}}</ref> Airdrie reached the Texaco Cup Final in [[1971–72 in Scottish football|1972]], losing 2–1 on aggregate to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. They also reached the [[1975 Scottish Cup Final]], losing 3–1 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. After the leagues were restructured in 1975, a competition called the [[Spring Cup]] was instituted for the teams in the lower divisions.<ref name = "Crampsey197">{{harvnb|Crampsey|1990|p=197}}</ref> Airdrie won this competition in [[1975–76 in Scottish football|1976]], but it was discontinued after one season as clubs preferred to play additional league games instead.<ref name = "Crampsey197"/>

===Alex MacDonald era===
[[Image:Airdriecelticcupfinal.jpg|thumb|left|245px|Airdrieonians compete in the [[1995 Scottish Cup Final]].]]
During the 1990s, with [[Alex MacDonald (footballer born 1948)|Alex MacDonald]] at the helm, Airdrie worked their way into the [[Scottish Premier Division|Premier Division]] in the [[1991–92 in Scottish football|1991–92]] and [[1992–93 in Scottish football|1992–93]] seasons, were regularly considered challengers for promotion and recognised as one of the bigger clubs in [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]].

MacDonald also guided the Diamonds to two [[Scottish Cup Final]]s. The first appearance coming on 9 May 1992 when the club faced [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in front of 44,045 strong crowd at [[Hampden Park]]. Unfortunately for Airdrie on this occasion however, a goal each from [[Mark Hateley]] and [[Ally McCoist]] earned the blue half of [[Glasgow]] a 2–1 victory.

Although Airdrie lost in the [[1992 Scottish Cup Final]] they had already qualified for the [[1992–93 European Cup Winners' Cup]], as [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] had also won the [[list of Scottish football champions|Scottish league championship]] in [[1991–92 in Scottish football|1992]]. Airdrie were drawn against Czech side [[Sparta Prague]] in the first round. Airdrie lost 1–0 at Broomfield and 2–1 in Prague, losing 3–1 on aggregate. [[Kenny Black]], who later went on to become manager of [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]], scored the only Airdrie goal.

Airdrie also reached the [[1995 Scottish Cup Final]], where they faced the other half of the [[Old Firm]], [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Airdrie would once again fall at the final hurdle, as they lost 1–0 to a [[Pierre van Hooijdonk]] goal. Airdrie also won the [[Scottish Challenge Cup]] in [[1994–95 in Scottish football|1994–95]].

===Stadium problems===

Airdrie sold their Broomfield home to Safeway in 1994, but had to groundshare with [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] at Broadwood Stadium for four years until the [[Excelsior Stadium]] was opened. It is arguably this stadium re-location and the difficulties generated by it that was Airdrie's first step towards oblivion. The mismanagement of the entire situation by the club's board, as well as [[North Lanarkshire]] Council's lengthy delay in granting planning permission caused Airdrieonians financial situation to reach critical level. This was not helped by the low attendances at [[Excelsior Stadium]] following the completion of the move which, was connected to the quality of football on display due to the lack of funds available to be spent on the team.

The demise of Airdrieonians was personified by the sudden and unexpected death of Joey Rowan, the club's sole remaining director. Rowan had a long and intimate association with the club and was son-in-law and advisor to Airdrieonians long term benefactor Jack Dalziel (recognised by having the main stand named after him). Rowan, already a popular figure with the club's supporters due to his passion, candour and trademark ponytail, gained even more respect by remaining with Airdrieonians and incurring substantial personal losses whilst trying to steer the club away from liquidation despite the fact that the rest of the board had resigned amid finger-pointing and acrimony in an attempt to avoid reproach and financial liabilities. He is considered the club's last great hero for his selfless sacrifice and unyielding loyalty.

===Liquidation===

After Airdrieonians went out of business on 1 May 2002, local accountant [[Jim Ballantyne]] attempted to gain entry to the [[Scottish Football League]] (SFL) with a team named [[Airdrie United F.C.|Airdrie United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/2048687.stm|title=Airdrie may edge out Gretna |first=Clive|last=Lindsay|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=17 June 2002|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref> His bid for league status was rejected, however, in favour of the application by [[Gretna F.C.|Gretna]], who were then playing in the English [[Northern Premier League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/jun/18/newsstory.sport3|title=Gretna beat Airdrie United to Scottish League place|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=18 June 2002 |accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref> Ballantyne then opted to buy control of [[Clydebank F.C.|Clydebank]], another SFL club experiencing extreme financial hardship.<ref name = "clydebank">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/2069736.stm|title=Airdrie United given green light|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|date=1 July 2002|accessdate=17 June 2012}}</ref> With approval by the SFL, their name was changed to Airdrie United, the team relocated to Airdrie and the strip was altered to the famous diamond style of Airdrieonians.<ref name = "clydebank"/>

[[Image:Excelsior Stadium.png|thumb|250px|Front Entrance to [[Excelsior Stadium]]]]
For most of its history, Airdrieonians played at [[Broomfield Park]], which was opened in 1892.<ref name = "Inglis427">{{harvnb|Inglis|1996|p=427}}</ref> The ground was located in a hollow in [[Airdrie, North Lanarkshire|Airdrie]] town centre.<ref name = "Inglis427"/> The Broomfield pitch was very narrow, at just 67 yards wide.<ref name = "Inglis427"/> These physical features and the proximity of the stands to the pitch meant that Broomfield had a raucous atmosphere, which visiting clubs disliked.<ref name = "Inglis427"/> Broomfield was known for its distinctive corner pavilion, which was built in 1907.<ref name = "Inglis427"/> After winning the [[1923–24 Scottish Cup]], the club built a main stand, adjacent to the pavilion.<ref name = "Inglis427"/>

The final game at [[Broomfield Park|Broomfield]] took place in May 1994 after which the ground, having been sold to supermarket chain [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]], was demolished to make room for their new store.<ref name = "Inglis427"/> The club planned to make use of the funds generated from the sale to build a new all-seated stadium, but had difficulties acquiring planning permission.<ref name = "Inglis427"/> Airdrie went on to groundshare with [[Clyde F.C.|Clyde]] at [[Broadwood Stadium]] in [[Cumbernauld]]<ref name = "Inglis427"/> for four seasons with the club eventually moving into its new home, the [[Excelsior Stadium|Shyberry Excelsior Stadium]], in time for the [[1998–99 in Scottish football|1998–99]] season. Airdrieonians played their home games there until they were liquidated in 2002.

===European record===
Airdrieonians qualified for a UEFA club competition on one occasion. In 1992, Airdrieonians reached [[1992 Scottish Cup Final|the final of the Scottish Cup]] and were beaten by [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]]. The winner of the [[Scottish Cup]] would normally qualify for the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], but because Rangers had already qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] through their league ranking in the [[Scottish Premier Division]], the place was passed to Airdrie as runners-up. Airdrie were eliminated in the [[1992–93 European Cup Winners' Cup#First round|first round]] by [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] of Czechoslovakia in a [[two-legged tie]].
