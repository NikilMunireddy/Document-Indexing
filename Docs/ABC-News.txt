'''ABC News''' is the [[journalism|news]] division of the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), owned by the [[Disney Media Networks]] division of [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Its flagship program is the daily evening newscast ''[[ABC World News Tonight]]''; other programs include [[Breakfast television|morning news-talk show]] ''[[Good Morning America]]'', [[television news magazine|newsmagazine series]] ''[[Nightline]]'', ''[[Primetime (TV series)|Primetime]]'' and ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'', and [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday morning political affairs]] program ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week with George Stephanopoulos]]''.

==History==
ABC began news broadcasts early in its independent existence as a [[radio network]] after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) ordered [[NBC]] to [[Spin out|spin off]] the former [[Blue Network|NBC Blue Network]] into an independent company in 1943.<ref>{{cite news|title=Red and Blue Networks of NBC To Be Split; WJZ May Be Sold|author=Thomas P. Swift|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=January 9, 1942}}</ref> The split (which NBC conducted voluntarily in the event that its appeal to have the ruling overturned was denied) was enforced to expand competition in radio broadcasting in the [[United States]] as the industry had only a few companies such as NBC and [[CBS]] that dominated the radio market, and in particular, was intended to prevent the limited competition from dominating news and political broadcasting and projecting narrow [[point of view (philosophy)|points-of-view]]. Television [[History of television#United States and Canada|broadcasting was suspended]] however, during [[World War II]].

Regular television news broadcasts on ABC began soon after the network signed on its initial [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated television station]] (WJZ-TV, now [[WABC-TV]]) and production center in [[New York City]] in August 1948. ABC news broadcasts have continued as the television network expanded nationwide, a process that took many years beginning with its launch in 1948. However, from the 1950s through the early 1970s, ABC News' programs (as was the case with the television network in general during that period) consistently ranked third in viewership behind news programs on [[CBS News|CBS]] and [[NBC News|NBC]]. Until the 1970s, the ABC television network had fewer [[network affiliate|affiliate stations]], as well as a weaker prime-time programming slate to be able to truly support the network's news operations in comparison to the two larger networks, each of which had established their radio news operations during the 1930s.

===Under Roone Arledge===
Only after [[Roone Arledge]], the president of [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]] at the time, was appointed as president of ABC News in 1977, at a time when the network's prime-time entertainment programs were achieving stronger ratings and drawing in higher advertising revenue and profits to the ABC corporation overall, was ABC able to invest the resources to make it a major source of news content. Arledge, known for experimenting with the broadcast "model", created many of ABC News' most popular and enduring programs, including ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]'', ''[[ABC World News Tonight|World News Tonight]]'', ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', ''[[Nightline]]'' and ''[[Primetime (TV series)|Primetime Live]]''.<ref>http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/NEWarledgeobit.html</ref>

ABC News' longtime slogan, "More Americans get their news from ABC News than from any other source" (introduced in the late 1980s), was a claim referring to the number of people who watch, listen and read ABC News content on television, radio and (eventually) the Internet, and not necessarily to the telecasts alone.<ref>{{cite web|title=ABC News, Disney Online and ESPN.com Providing Extensive Line-Up of Podcast Content via the New iTunes Podcast Directory |url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |publisher=The Walt Disney Company |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=December 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090621053357/http://corporate.disney.go.com:80/wdig/press_releases/2005/2005_0628_disney.html |archivedate=June 21, 2009 }}</ref>

In June 1998, ABC News (which owned an 80% stake in the service), [[Nine Network]] and [[ITN]] sold their respective interests in Worldwide Television News to the [[Associated Press]]. Additionally, ABC News signed a multi-year content deal with AP for its affiliate video service [[Associated Press Television News]] (APTV) while providing material from ABC's news video service ABC News One to APTV.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|title=A.P. Buys Worldwide Television News|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/03/business/ap-buys-worldwide-television-news.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 3, 1998|accessdate=October 30, 2014}}</ref>

==Association with ESPN==
[[ESPN]], a sports-news organization with several [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] channels – and also majority owned by ABC parent company The Walt Disney Company – provides sports bulletins and video footage for some of ABC News' programs, especially the network's overnight news programs; ''[[America This Morning]]'' features a segment of sports highlights provided by the overnight anchors of ESPN's flagship sports news program ''[[SportsCenter]]''.

==Other services==
===ABC News Radio===
{{main|ABC News Radio}}
[[ABC News Radio]], a service syndicated by [[Cumulus Media Networks]], broadcasts hourly news updates, live feeds and specialty news, sports and entertainment programming to approximately 2,000 radio affiliates nationwide. As part of Disney's sale of the ABC Radio division to [[Citadel Broadcasting]] in 2007, ABC News entered into an exclusive agreement with Citadel to distribute its radio news service on terrestrial stations (Citadel has since merged with [[Cumulus Media]]).

===Former===
====Satellite News Channel====
{{main|Satellite News Channel}}
[[Satellite News Channel]] was a joint venture between ABC News and [[Westinghouse Broadcasting|Group W]] that started on June 21, 1982 as a satellite-delivered cable television network. SNC used footage from ABC News and 7 [[Washington, D.C.]]-based crews, in addition to stories from other overseas networks to provide a rotating newscast every 20 minutes. However, this channel had difficulty getting clearance from cable systems, so ABC News and Group W decided to sell it to its competitor, [[CNN]] (a subsidiary of [[TimeWarner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting System]]). CNN ceased Satellite News Channel's operations on October 27, 1983. SNC was either replaced by CNN or [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN2]] on most cable systems. Group W would eventually shut down 7 years later, in 1999. Following Satellite News Channel's discontinuation, ABC News did not return to the 24-hour cable news world until 22 years later, in 2004, when they launched [[ABC News Now]], whose launch indicated that Satellite News Channel was ABC News' 1st attempt in the 24-hour cable news world.

====''ABC News Now''====
{{main|ABC News Now}}
''[[ABC News Now]]'' was a [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] [[Cable television|cable]] [[News broadcasting|news]] [[Cable network|network]] that was launched on July 26, 2004, as a [[digital subchannel]], by ABC News, being the company's 2nd attempt in the 24-hour cable news world after [[Satellite News Channel]]. It was offered via [[digital television]], [[broadband]] and [[Streaming media|streaming video]] at [http://www.abcnews.com ABCNews.com] and on [[mobile phones]]. It delivered [[breaking news]], [[headline news]] each half hour, and wide range of [[entertainment]] and [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] [[Broadcast programming|programming]]. The channel was available in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. Its Talk Back feature allowed viewers to voice their own input through the submission of videos and personal thoughts on controversial issues and current topics. It was shut down as a digital subchannel when [[Live Well Network]] was launched. ABC News Now was replaced on cable providers with [[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]] on October 28, 2013.

====Fusion==== 
{{main|Fusion (TV channel)}}
[[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]] is a [[digital cable]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] network that is owned & operated by Fusion Media Network, LLC, which was a [[joint venture]] between ABC News and [[Univision Communications]]. ABC and Univision formally announced its launch on May 2, 2012. Launched on October 28, 2013, Fusion features a mix of traditional news and investigative programs along with satirical content aimed at English-speaking [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic and Latino American]] adults between the ages of 18 and 34.<ref name=tvc>{{cite web |title=ABC, Univision teaming on News Network|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/59240/abc-univision-teaming-on-news-network?ref=search|work=TVNewsCheck|publisher=NewsCheck Media|date=May 7, 2012|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ABC and Univision Announce New Cable Network 'Fusion' Will Launch Later in 2013 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/abc-news-univision-announce-cable-network-called-fusion/t/story?id=18468776|work=ABC News|date=February 11, 2013}}</ref> Fusion was ABC News' 3rd attempt in the 24-hour cable news world after [[Satellite News Channel]] in 1982 and [[ABC News Now]] (which it replaced) in 2004. In December 2015, it was reported that Disney was in talks to sell its stake in Fusion to Univision.<ref>https://next.ft.com/content/ec752c9c-a8f9-11e5-955c-1e1d6de94879</ref> The split was complete on April 21, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last1=James|first1=Meg|title=Walt Disney Co.'s ABC sells its Fusion stake to Univision, exits joint venture|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-abc-ends-fusion-univision-20160421-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=21 April 2016}}</ref>

==International broadcasts==
Several ABC News programs are broadcast daily on [[OSN News]], a service consisting of three [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] satellite channel exclusively offering [[United States|American]] news programs from ABC, [[NBC]], [[PBS]] and [[MSNBC]] to U.S. expatriates and other viewers abroad, primarily geared towards an audience in the [[Middle East and North Africa]]. The network is available on digital cable and satellite in [[Europe]], [[Northeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], however, cable providers in Europe are currently unable to carry the channels due to unsolved rights issues. It is also available online on ABC News' website.

In the [[United Kingdom]], ''ABC World News Tonight'' airs daily at 1:30&nbsp;a.m. local time on the [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News Channel]], which itself may be [[simulcast]] on [[BBC One]] or [[BBC Two]] during the overnight hours. Commercials are not presented during the broadcast as the BBC's services in the U.K. are financed through [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom|license fees]]. ABC and the BBC also share video segments and reporters as needed for news coverage in their respective countries.

In [[Australia]], [[Sky News Australia]] airs daily broadcasts of ''World News Tonight'' (at 10:30&nbsp;a.m.) and ''Nightline'' (at 1:30&nbsp;a.m.) as well as weekly airings of ''20/20'' (on Wednesdays at 1:30&nbsp;p.m., with an extended version at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on Sundays) and occasionally ''Primetime'' (at 1:30&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays, with extended edition at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. on Saturdays). Coincidentally, that country's [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], operates its own unrelated news division that is also named [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]. The U.S. ABC News maintains a content sharing agreement with the [[Nine Network]], which also broadcasts ''GMA'' domestically in the early morning before its own [[Today (Australian TV program)|breakfast program]].

In [[New Zealand]], ''ABC World News'' was broadcast daily at 5:10&nbsp;p.m. and at again at 11:35&nbsp;p.m. As with the BBC in the U.K., [[TVNZ 7]] (owned by [[Television New Zealand]]) aired the program commercial-free, until the channel ceased operations on June 30, 2012.
