The '''Australian Open''' is a major [[tennis]] tournament held annually over the last fortnight of January in [[Melbourne]], Australia. First held in 1905, the tournament is chronologically the first of the four [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tennis events of the year&nbsp;– the other three being the [[French Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. It features men's and women's singles; men's, women's and mixed doubles and junior's championships; as well as wheelchair, legends and exhibition events. Prior to 1988 the tournament had been played on grass. Since 1988 two types of [[hardcourt]] surfaces have been used at [[Melbourne Park]] – green [[Rebound Ace]] to 2007 and blue [[Plexicushion]] from 2008.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tennis/australian-open-court-surface-is-speeding-up/2007/11/19/1195321694990.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | first=Stathi | last=Paxinos | title=Australian Open court surface is speeding up | date=20 November 2007}}</ref>

The Australian Open typically has high attendance, second only to the US Open. It was also the first Grand Slam tournament to feature indoor play during wet weather or extreme heat with its three primary courts, the [[Rod Laver Arena]], [[Hisense Arena]] and the refurbished [[Margaret Court Arena]] equipped with retractable roofs.

==History==
[[File:Australian Open 2007 Night Session.JPG|thumb|Inside Rod Laver Arena prior to an evening session in 2007]]

The Australian Open is managed by [[Tennis Australia]], formerly the Lawn Tennis Association of Australia (LTAA), and was first played at the [[Albert Cricket Ground|Warehouseman's Cricket Ground]] in Melbourne in November [[1905 Australasian Championships|1905]]. This facility is now known as the Albert Reserve Tennis Centre.<ref name=jazzsports>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazzsports.com/tennis-odds-grand-slam-events/australian-open-tennis-odds/australian-open-tennis-history.php |title=Australian Tennis Open History |publisher=Jazzsports|accessdate=22 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080130004049/http://www.jazzsports.com/tennis-odds-grand-slam-events/australian-open-tennis-odds/australian-open-tennis-history.php| archivedate= 30 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The tournament was first known as the '''Australasian Championships''' and then became the '''Australian Championships''' in 1927 and the Australian Open in 1969.<ref name=OfficialHist>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history.html |title=History of the Australian Open&nbsp;– the Grand Slam of Asia/Pacific|author=Tristan Foenander|publisher=Australian Open|accessdate=22 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080120114020/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/event_guide/history.html| archivedate= 20 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Since 1905, the Australian Open has been staged in five Australian and two New Zealand cities as follows: [[Melbourne]] (55 times), [[Sydney]] (17 times), [[Adelaide]] (14 times), [[Brisbane]] (7 times), [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] (3 times), [[Christchurch]] (1906) and [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]] (1912).<ref name=OfficialHist /> Though started in 1905, the tournament was not designated as being a major championship until 1924, by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) at a 1923 meeting. The tournament committee changed the structure of the tournament to include seeding at that time.<ref name=majorstatus>{{cite web|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/16104993?searchTerm=Tennis |title=Australasian Championships|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |author=Unknown|date=9 November 1923|accessdate=19 July 2010}}</ref> In 1972, it was decided to stage the tournament in [[Melbourne]] each year because it attracted the biggest patronage of any Australian city.<ref name=jazzsports /> The tournament was played at the [[Kooyong Lawn Tennis Club]] from 1972 until the move to the new [[Melbourne Park]] complex in 1988.

The new facilities at Melbourne Park (formerly Flinders Park) were envisaged to meet the demands of a tournament that had outgrown Kooyong's capacity. The move to Melbourne Park was an immediate success, with a 90 percent increase in attendance in 1988 (266,436) on the previous year at Kooyong (140,000).<ref name=TheAge>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23049738-5015682,00.html |title=Open began as Aussie closed shop|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Frank Cook|date=14 February 2008|accessdate=22 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080201114912/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23049738-5015682,00.html| archivedate= 1 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Because of Australia's geographic remoteness, very few foreign players entered this tournament in the early 20th century. In the 1920s, the trip by ship from Europe to Australia took about 45 days. The first tennis players who came by boats were the US [[Davis Cup]] players in November 1946.<ref name=TheAge/> Even inside the country, many players could not travel easily. When the tournament was held in Perth, no one from Victoria or New South Wales crossed by train, a distance of about {{Convert|3000|km|mi}} between the east and west coasts. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended and the tournament was won by a New Zealander.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=100 |title=Anthony Frederick Wilding "Tony"|publisher=[[International Tennis Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=1 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182502/http://www.tennisfame.com/famer.aspx?pgID=867&hof_id=100 |archivedate = 30 September 2007}}</ref>

The first tournaments of the Australasian Championships suffered from the competition of the other Australasian tournaments. Before 1905, all Australian states and New Zealand had their own championships, the first organised in 1880 in Melbourne and called the Championship of the Colony of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] (later the Championship of Victoria).<ref name=tennis.com.au>{{cite web|url=http://www.tennis.com.au/pages/default.aspx?id=21&pageId=878 |title=History of Tennis&nbsp;– From humble beginnings|publisher=[[Tennis Australia]]|accessdate=25 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080131194530/http://www.tennis.com.au/pages/default.aspx?id=21&pageId=878| archivedate= 31 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}{{Dead link|date=July 2011}}</ref> In those years, the best two players&nbsp;– Australian [[Norman Brookes]] (whose name is now written on the men's singles cup) and New Zealander [[Anthony Wilding]]&nbsp;– almost did not play this tournament. Brookes came once and won in 1911, and Wilding entered and won the competition twice (1906 and 1909). Their meetings in the Victorian Championships (or at Wimbledon) helped to determine the best Australasian players. Even when the Australasian Championships were held in Hastings, New Zealand, in 1912, Wilding, though three times Wimbledon champion, did not come back to his home country. It was a recurring problem for all players of the era. Brookes went to Europe only three times, where he reached the Wimbledon Challenge Round once and then won Wimbledon twice. Thus, many players had never played the Austral(as)ian amateur or open championships: the Doherty brothers, [[William Larned]], [[Maurice McLoughlin]], [[Beals Wright]], [[Bill Johnston (tennis)|Bill Johnston]], [[Bill Tilden]], [[René Lacoste]], [[Henri Cochet]], [[Bobby Riggs]], [[Jack Kramer]], [[Ted Schroeder]], [[Pancho Gonzales]], [[Budge Patty]], [[Manuel Santana]], [[Jan Kodeš]] and others, while Brookes, [[Ellsworth Vines]], [[Jaroslav Drobný]], [[Manuel Orantes]], [[Ilie Năstase]] (at 35 years old) and [[Björn Borg]] came just once.

Beginning in 1969, when the first Australian Open was held on the [[Milton Courts]] at Brisbane, the tournament was open to all players, including professionals who were not allowed to play the traditional circuit.<ref name=Ausstadiums>{{cite web|url=http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/special/milton.php |title=Milton Tennis Centre|publisher=Australian Stadiums|accessdate=25 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080117043727/http://www.austadiums.com/stadiums/special/milton.php| archivedate= 17 January 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Nevertheless, except for the 1969 and 1971 tournaments, many of the best players missed this championship until 1982, because of the remoteness, the inconvenient dates (around Christmas and New Year's Day) and the low prize money. In 1970, [[George MacCall]]'s [[National Tennis League]], which employed [[Rod Laver]], [[Ken Rosewall]], [[Andrés Gimeno]], Pancho Gonzales, [[Roy Emerson]] and [[Fred Stolle]], prevented its players from entering the tournament because the guarantees were insufficient. The tournament was won by [[Arthur Ashe]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23047855-5001023,00.html |title=Hewitt chases amazing slam win|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|author=Nikki Tugwell |date=14 January 2008|accessdate=25 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080201114907/http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,23047855-5001023,00.html| archivedate= 1 February 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1983, [[Ivan Lendl]], [[John McEnroe]] and [[Mats Wilander]] entered the tournament. Wilander won the singles title<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wilandertribute.com/22.html |title=Australian Open 1983|author=Alan Trengove|publisher=wilandertribute.com |accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> and both his [[Davis Cup]] singles rubbers in the [[1983 Davis Cup#Final|Swedish loss to Australia]] at [[Kooyong Stadium|Kooyong]] shortly after.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daviscup.com/en/draws-results/tie/details.aspx?tieId=10000700 |title=World Group 1983 Final|publisher=[[Davis Cup]]|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> Following the 1983 Australian Open, the [[International Tennis Federation]] prompted the [[Tennis Australia|Lawn Tennis Association of Australia]] to change the site of the tournament, because the Kooyong stadium was then inappropriate to serve such a big event. In 1988 the tournament was first held at Flinders Park (later renamed Melbourne Park) on [[Rebound Ace]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,21131668-5001023,00.html |title=Rebound Ace under review|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=29 January 2007|accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> The change of the venue also lead to a change of the court surface from grass to a hard court surface known as Rebound Ace. Mats Wilander was the only player to win the tournament on both grass and hard courts. In 2008, after being used for 20 years, the Rebound Ace was replaced by a cushioned, medium-paced,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itftennis.com/technical/equipment/courts/courtlist.asp|title=List of Classified Court Surfaces|work=itftennis.com}}</ref> acrylic surface known as [[Plexicushion|Plexicushion Prestige]]. [[Roger Federer]] and [[Serena Williams]] are the only players to win the Australian Open on both Rebound Ace and Plexicushion Prestige. The main benefits of the new surface are better consistency and less retention of heat because of a thinner top layer. This change was accompanied by changes in the surfaces of all lead-up tournaments to the Australian Open. The change was controversial because of the new surface's similarity to [[DecoTurf]], the surface used by the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boston.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2008/01/28/story7.html|title=Tennis court surfacer serves up two major deals|work=Boston Business Journal}}</ref>

Before the Melbourne Park stadium era, tournament dates fluctuated as well, in particular in the early years because of the climate of each site or exceptional events. For example, the 1919 tournament was held in January 1920 (the 1920 tournament was played in March) and the 1923 tournament in Brisbane took place in August when the weather was not too hot and wet. After a first 1977 tournament was held in December 1976&nbsp;– January 1977, the organisers chose to move the next tournament forward a few days, then a second 1977 tournament was played (ended on 31 December), but this failed to attract the best players. From 1982 to 1985, the tournament was played in mid-December. Then it was decided to move the next tournament to mid-January (January 1987), which meant there was no tournament in 1986. Since 1987, the Australian Open date has not changed. However, some top players, including [[Roger Federer]] and [[Rafael Nadal]], have said that the tournament is held too soon after the Christmas and New Year holidays, thus preventing players from reaching their best form, and expressed a desire to shift it to February.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24922806-3162,00.html|title=Rafael Nadal keen to call time on early slam|work=Herald Sun |location=Australia|date=17 January 2009|accessdate=18 September 2009 | first=Leo | last=Schlink}}</ref> Such a change, however, would move the tournament outside the summer school holiday period, potentially impacting attendance figures.

Another change of venue was proposed in 2008, with New South Wales authorities making clear their desire to bid for hosting rights to the tournament once Melbourne's contract expires in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sydney plans Australian Open bid|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/tennis/7665088.stm|website=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|date=11 October 2008}}</ref> In response, Wayne Kayler-Thomson, the head of the Victorian Events Industry Council, was adamant that Melbourne should retain the event. In a scathing attack of the New South Wales authorities, he said, "It is disappointing that NSW cannot be original and seek their own events instead of trying to cannibalise other Australian cities."<ref>{{cite web|author1=Cameron Houston|author2=Jason Dowling|title=NSW in negotiations to transfer Open from Melbourne|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw-in-negotiations-to-transfer-open-from-melbourne-20081010-4ydk.html|website=www.smh.com.au|publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=11 October 2008}}</ref> Since the proposal was made, a major redevelopment of Melbourne Park has been announced, which is expected to run into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Melbourne Park will include upgraded and increased seating in major venues, a roof over Margaret Court Arena, improved player facilities, a new headquarters for Tennis Australia and a partly covered "town square" area featuring large televisions showing current tennis play.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24964166-661,00.html |title=Brumby Government announces Melbourne Park redevelopment |work=Herald Sun |location=Australia |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=22 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090202033335/http://www.news.com.au:80/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24964166-661,00.html |archivedate=2 February 2009 }}</ref> A year later, these plans were largely approved, with former [[Premier of Victoria]] [[John Brumby]] confirming the state government's willingness to commit {{A$}}363&nbsp;million to complete the renovations, a move which guaranteed there will be no change of venue until at least beyond 2036.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/news/articles/2010-01-19/201001191263860753359.html?fpos=r2|archiveurl=//wayback.archive.org/web/20100122125136/http://www.australianopen.com/en_AU/news/articles/2010-01-19/201001191263860753359.html?fpos=r2|archivedate=22 January 2010|title=Australian Open Tennis Championships 2010 – News – The Grand Slam of Asia/Pacific – Official Site by IBM<!-- Bot generated title -->|work=australianopen.com}}</ref>
