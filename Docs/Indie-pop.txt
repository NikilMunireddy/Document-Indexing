'''Indie pop''' is a subgenre of [[alternative rock]] that originated in the [[United Kingdom]] in the mid-1980s, with its roots in Scottish [[post-punk]] bands on the [[Postcard Records]] label in the early 1980s ([[Josef K (band)|Josef K]] and [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]]) and the dominant UK independent band of the mid-1980s, [[the Smiths]]. Indie pop was inspired by [[Punk rock|punk]]'s [[DIY ethic]] and related [[Punk ideologies|ideologies]], and it generated a thriving [[fanzine]], [[Independent record label|label]], and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from [[indie rock]] to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free.<ref>{{Citation |author= |contribution= |date= |title=Indie pop |journal=Allmusic |editor= |edition= |isbn= |issn= |volume= |pages= |place= |publisher= |url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/indie-pop-d4557 |accessdate= |authorlink= |archiveurl=

The term "indie" had been used for some time to describe artists on independent labels (and the labels themselves). One of the first records to have the term 'indie' applied was the 1977 [[Spiral Scratch (EP)|Spiral Scratch EP]] by the band [[Buzzcocks]]. That record was among the first self-published by a band and was therefore 'independent' of the major record labels. It has been argued that Spiral Scratch was the first 'indie' record <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.23indie.com/indiemusicdefined.html|title=A definition of indie music|website=www.23indie.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}</ref> Another key moment in the naming of "indie pop" as a genre was the release of ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]'' tape in 1986.<ref name="BBC Radio 2">{{Citation |title=Twee; Paul Morley's Guide to Musical Genres |work=[[BBC Radio 2]] |date=10 June 2008 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00bz94n }}</ref> The compilation featured, among other artists, [[Primal Scream]], [[the Pastels]], and [[the Wedding Present]], and "indie" quickly became shorthand for a genre whose defining conventions were identified as [[Jangle pop|jangling]] guitars, a love of [[1960s in music|'60s pop]], and melodic [[power pop]] song structures (the genre was initially dubbed "C86" after the tape itself).

In the mid to late 1980s, indie pop was criticized for its associations with so-called "shambling" (a [[John Peel]]-coined description celebrating the self-conscious primitive approach of some of the music<ref name="timeout.com">[http://www.timeout.com/london/music/features/2167/The_C86_indie_scene_is_back.html Simon Reynolds, ''Time Out'', 23 October 2006]</ref>) and [[Underachiever|underachievement]], but the ''C86'' indie pop scene is now recognized as a pivotal moment for [[independent music]] in the UK,<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Bob Stanley (Saint Etienne)|Bob Stanley]], sleevenotes to ''[[CD86 (album)|CD86]]''</ref> as is recognized in the subtitle of that compilation's 2006 extended reissue: ''[[CD86 (album)|CD86: 48 Tracks from the Birth of Indie Pop]]''. Indie pop continues to have a strong following and inspire musicians, not just in the UK, but around the world, with new bands, labels and clubs devoted to the sound.

==Roots==
The birth of indie pop can be traced back to the [[post-punk]] explosion in limited-circulation photocopied [[fanzine]]s, and small shop-based [[Independent record label|record label]]s such as London's [[Rough Trade Records]] and Glasgow's [[Postcard Records]]. The publication in ''Record Business'' magazine of the first weekly [[UK Indie Chart|indie singles and album charts]] (for the week ending 19 January 1980) and the adoption of such charts in the UK music press stimulated activity. In order to reflect this, the British musical weekly ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' released an era-defining compilation [[Compact cassette|cassette]] called ''[[C81 (album)|C81]]''. This cassette featured a wide range of groups, reflecting the different approaches of the immediate post-punk era.

==History==
''NME'' followed up ''C81'' with ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]''. Similarly designed to reflect the new music scene of the time in the UK, it is now seen as the birth of indie pop in the UK (the 2006 extended reissue ''[[CD86 (album)|CD86]]'' is subtitled ''48 Tracks from the Birth of Indie Pop''). The UK music press was, in 1986, highly competitive, with four weekly papers documenting new bands and trends. The grouping of bands, often artificially, with an overarching label to heighten interest or sell copies, was commonplace. ''NME'' journalists of the period now agree that ''C86'' was an example of this, but also a by-product of ''NME'''s "hip hop wars",<ref>{{Citation |title=NME: Still Rocking at 50 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=24 February 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1836411.stm }}</ref> a schism in the paper (and among readers) between enthusiasts of contemporary progressive black music (for example, by [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] and [[Mantronix]]), and fans of guitar-based music, as represented on ''C86''. ''C86'' featured key early bands of the genre such as [[Primal Scream]] and [[the Pastels]], but also included tracks by several more abrasive, "shambling" bands from the [[Ron Johnson Records|Ron Johnson]] label, who were atypical of the perceived ''C86'' [[jangle pop]] aesthetic.

A link between ''C86'' and unifying genre is commonly disputed by critics and the bands actually on the original compilation. [[Everett True]], a writer for ''NME'' in the '80s under the name "The Legend!",<ref name=planb/> has argued that "C86 didn't actually exist as a sound, or style. I find it weird, bordering on surreal, that people are starting to use it as a description again".<ref name=planb>{{citation |first=Everett |last=True |title=Plan B Magazine Blog |date=22 July 2005 |url=http://planbmag.com/blogs/staff/2005/07/22/friday-22-july/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501212612/http://planbmag.com/blogs/staff/2005/07/22/friday-22-july/ |archivedate=May 1, 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2016 }}</ref> Geoff Taylor, a member of the band [[Age of Chance]], agreed: "We never considered ourselves part of any scene. Iâ€™m not sure that the public at large did either, to be honest. We were just an independent band around at that same time as the others."<ref>{{Citation |last=Taylor |first=Geoff |title=Interview, ireallylovemusic vs Age of Chance |url=http://www.ireallylovemusic.co.uk/interviews/irlm_vs_aoc.html }}</ref> [[Bob Stanley (Saint Etienne)|Bob Stanley]], a ''[[Melody Maker]]'' journalist in the late 1980s and founding member of pop band [[Saint Etienne (band)|Saint Etienne]], acknowledges that participants at the time reacted against lazy labelling, but insists they shared an approach:
<blockquote>Of course the "scene", like any scene, barely existed. Like squabbling [[Marxism|Marxist]] factions, groups who had much in common built up petty rivalries. [[The June Brides]] and the [[The Jasmine Minks|Jasmine Minks]] were the biggest names at [[Alan McGee]]'s Living Room Club and couldn't stand the sight of each other. Only when [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]] exploded and stole their two-headed crown did they realise they were basically soulmates.<ref name="ReferenceA"/></blockquote>
[[Manic Street Preachers]] bassist [[Nicky Wire]] remembers that it was the bands' very independence that gave the scene coherence: "People were doing everything themselves - making their own records, doing the artwork, gluing the sleeves together, releasing them and sending them out, writing fanzines because the music press lost interest really quickly."<ref>{{Citation |last=Wire |first=Nicky |title=The Birth of Uncool |newspaper=The Guardian |date=25 October 2006 |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1930836,00.html | location=London}}</ref>

Many of the actual ''C86'' bands distanced themselves from the scene cultivated around them by the UK music press - in its time, ''C86'' became a [[pejorative]] term for its associations with so-called "shambling" (a [[John Peel]]-coined description celebrating the self-conscious primitive approach of some of the music<ref name="timeout.com"/>) and [[Underachiever|underachievement]].

In 2004 the UK-focused [[Rough Trade (shops)|Rough Trade Shops]] compilation ''Indiepop Vol. 1'' effectively documented the history of the sound acknowledging that it pre- and post-dated 1986.

===Influences===
In his book ''Time Travel'', [[Pop music|pop]] historian [[Jon Savage]] traced the musical origins of ''C86'' and indie pop to the [[Velvet Underground]]'s [[The Velvet Underground (album)|eponymous third album]]. [[Power pop]] was a significant influence, as was [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[post-punk]]. Catchy [[power pop]] melodies made the [[Ramones]] and [[Buzzcocks]] the most identifiable punk influences. Before the last and main influence on ''C86'' and indie pop - [[the Smiths]] - the bands of Glasgow's post-punk [[independent record label|independent]] [[Postcard Records|Postcard]] label had some influence: [[Josef K (band)|Josef K]] and [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]] (along with contemporaries [[The Fire Engines]]). [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]]'s sound combined the Velvet Underground's "melancholy noise" with [[Beach Boys]] pop melodies and [[Phil Spector]]'s "[[Wall of Sound]]" production, while [[New Order (band)|New Order]] emerged from the demise of post-punk band [[Joy Division]] and experimented with [[synthpop]], [[techno]] and, later, [[house music]]. The Jesus and Mary Chain, along with [[Dinosaur Jr]], and the [[dream pop]] of [[Cocteau Twins]], were the formative influences for the [[shoegazing|shoegaze]] movement of the late 1980s. Named for the band members' tendency to stare at their feet and guitar effects pedals onstage rather than interact with the audience, acts like [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], and later [[Slowdive]] and [[Ride (band)|Ride]] created a loud "wash of sound" that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback. The other major movement at the end of the 1980s was the drug-fuelled [[Madchester]] scene. Based around [[the HaÃ§ienda]], a nightclub in [[Manchester]] owned by New Order and [[Factory Records]], Madchester bands such as [[Happy Mondays]] and [[the Stone Roses]] mixed [[acid house]] dance rhythms, [[Northern soul]] and [[funk]] with melodic guitar pop.

The [[jangle pop]] indie sensibility with which ''C86'' became synonymous began to be applied to bands who had not appeared on the tape. Some influenced by the compilation and later associated with it had yet to emerge in 1986, such as [[Talulah Gosh]] and [[Razorcuts]]. The UK label [[Sarah Records]], which released its first record in 1987, embraced the perceived [[Jangle pop|jangly]] indie pop sensibility in such a way that it - and its most popular bands, [[the Field Mice]] and [[Heavenly (British band)|Heavenly]] - could be seen as typical proponents.

The movement continued to hold sway into the 1990s. American indie pop band [[Beat Happening]]'s 1985 [[Beat Happening (album)|eponymous debut album]] was influential in the development of the indie pop sound, particularly in North America.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/beat-happening-mw0000648080 | title=Beat Happening - Beat Happening | publisher=[[Allmusic]] | accessdate=25 March 2015 | author=Abebe, Nitsuh}}</ref> Scenes developed in the United States, particularly around labels such as [[K Records]] and [[Slumberland Records]]. Bands of the US [[riot grrrl]] movement acknowledged a debt to ''C86'', and Scottish band [[Belle and Sebastian]] recognized its influence.

==Twee==
As a subgenre, Twee maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie-pop current, beginning as early as 1977. The author [[Marc Spitz]] suggests in his book ''Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film'' (2014) that the roots of Twee stem from the [[post-war]] 1950's music.<ref name="Spitz abstract">{{cite book |last=Spitz |first=Marc |date=3 June 2014 |title=Twee: The Gentle Revolution in Music, Books, Television, Fashion, and Film |url=http://www.amazon.com/Twee-Gentle-Revolution-Television-Fashion/dp/0062213040 |location= |publisher=It Books |page=abstract |isbn=0062213040}}</ref> While the culture categorized itself under the moniker of "indie" (short for independent), many major Twee powerhouses gained mainstream critical acclaim for their contributions to the twee movement.<ref>{{Citation |title=Twee as Fuck: The Story of Indie Pop |first=Nitsuh |last=Abebe |work=Pitchfork Media |date=24 October 2005 |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/articles/6176-twee-as-fuck/ }}</ref> An abbreviated list of artists includes, but is not limited to:<ref>{{Citation |title=10 Best Twee Bands |first=Carlos |last=Ramirez |work=Diffuser |date=14 April 2016 |url=http://diffuser.fm/best-twee-bands}}</ref>

The definition of Twee is something "excessively or affectedly quaint, pretty, or sentimental," supposedly born from a childish mispronunciation of the word [[sweet]]. While the terms "Twee" or "Twee pop" are considered pejorative in the UK, a retrospective fascination with the genre in the US saw Americans eagerly defining themselves as Twee.<ref name="BBC Radio 2"/> The Twee Renaissance grew larger than a sub-categorical genre and began to align itself with the [[optimistic]], [[DIY ethic|DIY]] neo-folk-art of the paradoxically mainstream-indie aesthetic.

A punk-influenced variant of indie pop, briefly prominent in the mid-1990s, was dubbed "cuddlecore."<ref name=cuddle>[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-06-28/news/ls-17984_1_real-cute "Cute.
