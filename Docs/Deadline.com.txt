==History==
Finke began writing her ''[[LA Weekly]]'' column Deadline Hollywood in June 2002, and began the Deadline Hollywood Daily (DHD) blog in March 2006 as an online version of her column. In 2009, she sold DHD to Mail.com Media for a reported "seven-figure payday", under an agreement by which she would hire an additional writer but remain the site's editor.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Los Angeles Times|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-deadline24-2009jun24,0,3372246.story|date=2009-06-24|author=Ben Fritz|title=Nikki Finke's Deadline Hollywood Daily is sold to Mail.com}}</ref> In September 2009, the name was changed to Deadline.com and additional cities were added,<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Portfolio|url=http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/pressed/2009/09/04/fixedja-nikki-finke/|author=Matt Haber|title=FIXEDJA!
