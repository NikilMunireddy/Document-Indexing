Shias also believe that Ali and the other [[Shia Imams]] (all of whom are members of the ''[[Ahl al-Bayt]]'', Muhammad's household) are the [[Succession to Muhammad|rightful successors to Muhammad]].

==In Mecca==

===Early life===
{{Main|Family tree of Ali|Birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib}}
Ali's father Abu Talib was the custodian of the Ka`bah and a [[sheikh]] of the [[Banu Hashim]], an important branch of the powerful [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]] tribe. He was also an uncle of Muhammad. Ali's mother, Fatima bint Asad, also belonged to Banu Hashim, making Ali a descendant of Ismail ([[Ishmael]]), the son of Ibrahim ([[Abraham]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=5}}</ref> Many sources, especially Shi`i ones, attest that Ali was [[People reported to be born in the Kaaba|born inside the Kaaba]] in the city of Mecca, where he stayed with his mother for three days.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="auto"/><ref>Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Volume 1, page 52-53, Dr. Ali M. Sallabi, 2011</ref> According to a tradition, Muhammad was the first person whom Ali saw as he took the newborn in his hands. Muhammad named him Ali, [[Ali (name)|meaning "the exalted one"]]. Muhammad had a close relationship with Ali's parents. When Muhammad was orphaned and later lost his grandfather [[Shaiba ibn Hashim|Abdul Muttalib]], Ali's father took him into his house.<ref name="Britannica"/> Ali was born two or three years after Muhammad married [[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=6 and 7}}</ref> When Ali was five or six years old, a famine occurred in and around Mecca, affecting the economic conditions of Ali's father, who had a large family to support. Muhammad took Ali into his home to raise him.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="Tabatabae191"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=7}}</ref>

===Acceptance of Islam===
{{See also|Identity of the first male Muslim}}

The second period of Ali's life began in 610 when he declared Islam at age 10 and ended with the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] of Muhammad to Medina in 622.<ref name="Britannica"/> When Muhammad reported that he had received a [[Wahy|divine revelation]], Ali, then only about ten years old, believed him and professed to Islam.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="Iranica"/><ref name="Tabatabae191">{{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=191}}</ref><ref name="Ashraf 2005 p=14">{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=14}}</ref><ref name="Islam">{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam and the Muslim world; vol.1|last = Diana|first = Steigerwald|title=Alī ibn Abu Talib|publisher=MacMillan|isbn =978-0-02-865604-5}}</ref> According to [[Ibn Ishaq]] and some other authorities, Ali was the first male to [[Religious conversion#Conversion to Islam|embrace Islam]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gleave|2015}}</ref> [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]] adds other traditions making the similar claim of being the first Muslim in relation to [[Zayd ibn Harithah]] or [[Abu Bakr]].<ref name="watt"/><ref>* See also:**[[Ibn Majah]] in [[Sunan ibn Majah]], Ibn Majah, al-Sunan, Vol. I, p. 44;**[[Hakim al-Nishaburi]] in [[Al-Mustadrak alaa al-Sahihain]], al-Hakim, al-Mustadrak, Vol. III, p. 112;** [[Ibn Hisham]] in [[As-Sirah an-Nabawiyyah]], Ibn Hisham, al-Sirah, Vol. I, p.245.</ref> Some historians and scholars believe Ali's conversion is not worthy enough to consider him the first male Muslim because he was a child at the time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Watt|1953|p=86}}</ref> Shia doctrine asserts that in keeping with Ali's divine mission, he accepted Islam before he took part in any [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] Meccan [[Arabian mythology|traditional religion]] rites, regarded by Muslims as [[polytheism|polytheistic]] (see [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]) or [[paganism|paganistic]]. Hence the Shia say of Ali that his face is honoured, as it was never sullied by prostrations before idols.<ref name="Tabatabae191"/> The Sunnis also use the honorific ''Karam Allahu Wajhahu'', which means "God's Favour upon his Face." The reason his acceptance is often not called a conversion is because he was never an idol worshipper like the people of Mecca. He was known to have broken idols in the mould of Abraham and asked people why they worshipped something they made themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ali|url=http://imamali.net/old/?part=350|publisher=Imamali|accessdate=20 March 2015}}</ref> [[Abd al-Muttalib|Ali's grandfather]], along with some members of the Bani Hashim clan, were ''[[Hanif]]s'', or followers of a monotheistic belief system prior to the coming of Islam.

===After declaration of Islam===
Muhammad invited people to Islam in secret for three years before he started inviting them publicly. When he was commanded to invite his closer relatives to come to Islam<ref>{{cite quran|26|214|style = ref}}</ref> he gathered the Banu Hashim clan in a ceremony. According to [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], [[Ali ibn al-Athir|Ibn Athir]] and [[Abu al-Fida]], Muhammad announced at invitational events that whoever assisted him in his invitation would become his brother, trustee and successor. Only Ali, who was thirteen or fourteen years old, stepped forward to help him. This invitation was repeated three times, but Ali was the only person who answered Muhammad. Recognising Ali's continual and singular response to his call, Muhammad declared that Ali was his brother, inheritor and vice-regent and people must obey him. Most of the adults present were uncles of Ali and Muhammad, and [[Abu Lahab]] laughed at them and declared to Abu Talib that he must bow down to his own son, as Ali was now his [[Emir]].<ref>See:* {{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=12}}* {{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=39}}</ref> This event is known as the [[Hadith of warning|Hadith of Warning]]. During the [[Persecution of Muslims by the Meccans|persecution of Muslims]] and [[Meccan boycott of the Hashemites|boycott of the Banu Hashim]] in Mecca, Ali stood firmly in support of Muhammad.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=16–26}}</ref>

===Migration to Medina===
{{See also|Hijra (Islam)}}
In 622, the year of Muhammad's migration to Yathrib (now Medina), Ali risked his life by sleeping in Muhammad's bed to impersonate him and thwart an assassination plot so that Muhammad could escape in safety.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="Tabatabae191"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=28 and 29}}</ref> This night is called ''Laylat al-Mabit''. According to some [[hadith]], a verse was revealed about Ali concerning his sacrifice on the night of Hijra which says "And among men is he who sells his ''[[nafs]]'' (self) in exchange for the pleasure of [[Allah]]."<ref>{{cite quran|2|207|style = ref}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.almizan.org/ |title=Tafsir al-Mizan, Volume 3: Surah Baqarah, Verses 204–207 |first= Sayyid Mohammad Hosayn|last= Tabatabaei |publisher=almizan.org |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>

Ali survived the plot, but risked his life again by staying in Mecca to carry out Muhammad's instructions: to restore to their owners all the goods and properties that had been entrusted to Muhammad for safekeeping. Ali then went to Medina with his mother, Muhammad's daughter Fatimah and two other women.<ref name="Iranica"/><ref name="Tabatabae191"/>

==In Medina==

===Muhammad's era===

{{See also|Muhammad in Medina|Military career of Ali}}

Ali was 22 or 23 years old when he migrated to Medina. When Muhammad was creating bonds of [[Brotherhood among the Sahaba|brotherhood among his companions]], he selected Ali as his brother.<ref name="Iranica"/><ref name="Tabatabae191"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=30–32}}</ref>
For the ten years that Muhammad led the community in Medina, Ali was extremely active in his service as his secretary and deputy, serving in his armies, the bearer of his banner in every battle, leading parties of warriors on raids, and carrying messages and orders.<ref>See:
* {{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=13 and 14}}
* {{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=28–118}}</ref> As one of Muhammad's lieutenants, and later his son-in-law, Ali was a person of authority and standing in the Muslim community.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Mehboob Desia|title=Islam and non-violence|publisher=Gyan Book Pvt Ltd|isbn=8121210267|page=150}}</ref>

====Family life====
{{main|Ali marital life}}
{{See also|Ahl al-Bayt|Hadith of the Event of the Cloak|The verse of purification}}

In 623, Muhammad told Ali that God ordered him to give his daughter [[Fatimah Zahra]] to Ali in marriage.<ref name="Britannica"/> Muhammad said to Fatimah: "I have married you to the dearest of my family to me."<ref>{{Harvnb|Singh|2003|p=175}}</ref> This family is glorified by Muhammad frequently and he declared them as his ''Ahl al-Bayt'' in events such as [[Mubahala]] and hadith like the [[Hadith of the Event of the Cloak]]. They were also glorified in the [[Quran]] in several cases such as "[[the verse of purification]]".<ref>{{cite quran|33|33|style = ref}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=14 and 15}}</ref>

Ali had four [[#Descendants|children]] born to Fatimah, the only child of Muhammad to have surviving progeny. Their two sons ([[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husain ibn Ali|Husain]]) were cited by Muhammad to be his own sons, honoured numerous times in his lifetime and titled "the leaders of the youth of Jannah" (Heaven, the hereafter.)<ref>See:
* {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|57|89}}

At the beginning they were extremely poor. For several years after his marriage, Fatimah did all of the household work by herself. The shoulder on which she carried pitchers of water from the well was swollen and the hand with which she worked the handmill to grind corn was often covered with blisters.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=42 and 43}}</ref> Fatimah vouched to take care of the household work, make dough, bake bread, and clean the house; in return, Ali vouched to take care of the outside work such as gathering firewood, and bringing food.<ref>{{Harvnb|Qazwini|1992|p=140}}</ref> Their circumstances were akin to many of the Muslims at the time and only improved following the [[Battle of Khaybar]] when the wealth of [[Khaybar]] was distributed among the poor. When the economic situations of the Muslims became better, Fatimah gained some maids but treated them like her family and performed the house duties with them.<ref name=EoI>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Vaglieri |first=Veccia|title=Fatima|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam|page= Vol. 2 844–850 |location=Leiden, The Netherlands |publisher=Brill |ISSN=1573-3912}}</ref>

Their marriage lasted until Fatimah's death ten years later. Although [[polygamy]] was permitted, Ali did not marry another woman while Fatimah was alive, and his marriage to her possesses a special spiritual significance for all Muslims because it is seen as the marriage between two great figures surrounding Muhammad. After Fatimah's death, Ali married other wives and fathered many children.<ref name="Britannica"/>

====Military career====
{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Ali}}
{{Main|Military career of Ali|List of expeditions of Muhammad}}

With the exception of the [[Battle of Tabouk]], Ali took part in all battles and expeditions fought for Islam.<ref name="Tabatabae191"/> As well as being the [[standard-bearer]] in those battles, Ali led parties of warriors on raids into enemy lands.

Ali first distinguished himself as a warrior in 624 at the [[Battle of Badr]]. He defeated the [[Umayyad caliphate|Umayyad]] champion [[Walid ibn Utba]] as well as many other Meccan soldiers. According to Muslim traditions Ali killed between twenty and thirty-five enemies in battle, most agreeing with twenty-seven.<ref>See:
* {{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=36}}
* {{Harvnb|Merrick|2005|p=247}}
</ref>

Ali was prominent at the [[Battle of Uhud]], as well as many other battles where he wielded a bifurcated sword known as [[Zulfiqar]].<ref name="Battles-of-Badr-and-Uhud">{{cite book

* {{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=66–68}}
* {{Harvnb|Zeitlin|2007|p=134}}</ref>
Following this battle Mohammad gave Ali the name ''Asadullah'', which in Arabic means "Lion of God".
Ali also defended Muhammad in the [[Battle of Hunayn]] in 630.<ref name="Britannica"/>

====Missions for Islam====
[[File:Levha (panel) in honor of Imam 'Ali.jpg|thumb|[[Islamic calligraphy|Arabic calligraphy]] which means "There is no brave youth except Ali and there is no sword which renders service except [[Zulfiqar]]."]]

Muhammad designated Ali as one of the scribes who would write down the text of the Quran, which had been revealed to Muhammad during the previous two decades. As Islam began to spread throughout Arabia, Ali helped establish the new Islamic order. He was instructed to write down the [[Treaty of Hudaybiyyah]], the peace treaty between Muhammad and the Quraysh in 628. Ali was so reliable and trustworthy that Muhammad asked him to carry the messages and declare the orders. In 630, Ali recited to a large gathering of pilgrims in Mecca [[At-Tawba|a portion of the Quran]] that declared Muhammad and the Islamic community were no longer bound by agreements made earlier with Arab [[polytheist]]s. During the [[Conquest of Mecca]] in 630, Muhammad asked Ali to guarantee that the conquest would be bloodless. He ordered Ali to break all the idols worshipped by the [[Banu Aus]], [[Banu Khazraj]], [[Tayy]], and those in the [[Kaaba]] to purify it after its defilement by the polytheism of the [[Jahiliyah|pre-Islamic era]]. Ali was sent to Yemen one year later to spread the teachings of Islam. He was also charged with settling several disputes and putting down the uprisings of various tribes.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref name="Iranica"/>

====Incident of Mubahala====
{{Main|Mubahala|Hadith of Mubahala}}
{{See also|Ahl al-Bayt}}
According to hadith collections, in 631 an [[Arab Christians|Arab Christian]] envoy from [[Najran]] (currently in northern [[Yemen]] and partly in [[Saudi Arabia]]) came to Muhammad to argue which of the two parties erred in its doctrine concerning Jesus. After likening Jesus' miraculous birth to Adam's creation,<ref>{{cite quran|3|59|style = ref}}</ref> Muhammad called them to ''[[mubahala]]'' (conversation), where each party should bring their knowledgeable men, women and children, and ask God to curse the lying party and their followers.<ref name="cite quran|3|61|style = ref">{{cite quran|3|61|style = ref}}</ref> Muhammad, to prove to them that he was a prophet, brought his daughter Fatimah, Ali and his grandchildren Hasan and Husayn. He went to the Christians and said "this is my family" and covered himself and his family with a cloak.<ref>See:
* [[Sahih Muslim]], Chapter of virtues of companions, section of virtues of Ali, 1980 Edition Pub. in Saudi Arabia, Arabic version, v4, p1871, the end of tradition No.&nbsp;32
* Sahih al-Tirmidhi, v5, p654
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=15 and 16}}
</ref> According to Muslim sources, when one of the Christian monks saw their faces, he advised his companions to withdraw from Mubahala for the sake of their lives and families. Thus the Christian monks vanished from the Mubahala place. [[Allameh Tabatabaei]] explains in ''[[Tafsir al-Mizan]]'' that the word "Our selves" in this verse<ref name="cite quran|3|61|style = ref"/> refers to Muhammad and Ali. Then he narrates that [[Imam Ali al-Rida]], eighth [[Twelve Imams|Shia Imam]], in discussion with [[Al-Ma'mun]], [[Abbasid]] caliph, referred to this verse to prove the superiority of Muhammad's progeny over the rest of the Muslim community, and considered it the proof for Ali's right for caliphate due to God having made Ali like the self of Muhammad.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.almizan.org/ |title=Tafsir al-Mizan, v.6, Al Imran, verses 61–63 |first= Sayyid Mohammad Hosayn|last= Tabatabaei |publisher=almizan.org |accessdate=2010-11-25}}</ref>

====Ghadir Khumm====
{{Main|Hadith of the pond of Khumm|Hadith of the two weighty things}}
[[File:Investiture of Ali Edinburgh codex.jpg|thumb|The Investiture of Ali, at [[Rabigh#Ghadir Al-Khumm|Ghadir Khumm]] ([[MS Arab 161]], fol. 162r, AD 1307/8 [[Ilkhanid]] manuscript illustration).]]

As Muhammad was returning from [[The Farewell Pilgrimage|his last pilgrimage]] in 632, he made statements about Ali that are interpreted very differently by Sunnis and Shias.<ref name="Britannica"/> He halted the caravan at [[Rabigh#Ghadir Al-Khumm|Ghadir Khumm]], gathered the returning pilgrims for communal prayer and began to address them:<ref name="Khumm"/>

According to [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]:
{{quote|text=Taking Ali by the hand, he asked of his faithful followers whether he, Muhammad, was not closer (awlā) to the Believers than they were to themselves; the crowd cried out: "It is so, O Apostle of God!"; he then declared: "He of whom I am the [[mawla]], of him Ali is also the mawla (man kuntu mawlāhu fa-ʿAlī mawlāhu)".<ref name="EncyclopediaIslam">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Veccia Vaglieri |first=Laura|authorlink=Laura Veccia Vaglieri|title=G̲h̲adīr K̲h̲umm|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia of Islam, Second Edition|accessdate=2013-03-28 |publisher=Brill Online |url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ghadir-khumm-SIM_2439| archiveurl=|archivedate=| deadurl= no}}</ref>

* {{Harvnb|Dakake|2008|pp=34–37}}
* Ibn Taymiyyah, Minhaaj as-Sunnah 7/319
"من كنت مولاه فهذا علي مولاه"</ref>}}
Shias regard these statements as constituting the designation of Ali as the [[succession to Muhammad|successor of Muhammad]] and as the first [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]]; by contrast, Sunnis take them only as an expression of close spiritual relationship between Muhammad and Ali, and of his wish that Ali, as his cousin and son-in-law, inherit his family responsibilities upon his death, but not necessarily a designation of political authority.

</ref> 
On the basis of this hadith, Shia say that Ali later insisted that his religious authority was superior to that of [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=253}}</ref>

===Succession to Muhammad===

After uniting the [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabian tribes]] into a single Muslim religious polity in the last years of his life, Muhammad's death in 632 signalled disagreement over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=31 and 32}}</ref> While Ali and the rest of Muhammad's close family were washing his body for burial, at a gathering attended by a small group of Muslims at [[Saqifah]], a close companion of Muhammad named Abu Bakr was nominated for the leadership of the community. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first caliph. The choice of Abu Bakr was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that Ali had been designated his successor by Muhammad himself.<ref name="Islam"/><ref>See:
* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|p=57}}

Later when Fatimah and Ali sought aid from the Companions in the matter of his right to the caliphate, they answered 'O daughter of the Messenger of God! We have given our allegiance to Abu Bakr. If Ali had come to us before this, we would certainly not have abandoned him'. Ali said, 'Was it fitting that we should wrangle over the caliphate even before the Prophet was buried?'<ref>Ibn Qutaybah, al-Imamah wa al-Siyasah, Vol. I, pp. 12–13</ref><ref>Ibn Abi al-Hadid, Sharh; Vol. II, p.5.</ref>

Following his election to the caliphate, Abu Bakr and [[Umar]] with a few other companions headed to [[Umar at Fatimah's house|Fatimah's house]] to force Ali and his supporters who had gathered there to give their allegiance to Abu Bakr. Then, it is alleged that Umar threatened to set the house on fire unless they came out and swore allegiance to Abu Bakr.<ref name="Madelung, 1997, p. 43">{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=43}}</ref> [[Fatimah]], in support of her husband, started a commotion and threatened to "uncover her hair", at which Abu Bakr relented and withdrew.<ref name=EoI/> Ali is reported to have repeatedly said that had there been forty men with him he would have resisted.<ref name="Madelung, 1997, p. 43"/> Ali did not actively assert his own right because he did not want to throw the nascent Muslim community into strife.<ref name="Iranica"/> Other sources say that Ali accepted the selection of Umar as caliph and even gave one of his daughters, Umm Kulthūm, to him in marriage.<ref name="Britannica"/>
[[File:Mirror writing2.jpg|thumb|18th century [[mirror writing]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[calligraphy]]. Depicts the phrase 'Ali is the vicegerent of God' in both directions.]]

This contentious issue caused Muslims to later split into two groups, Sunni and Shia. Sunnis assert that even though Muhammad never appointed a successor, Abu Bakr was elected first caliph by the Muslim community. The Sunnis recognise the first four caliphs as [[Rashidun|Muhammad's rightful successors]]. Shias believe that Muhammad explicitly named Ali as his successor at Ghadir Khumm and Muslim leadership belonged to him which had been determined by divine order.<ref name="Islam"/>

According to [[Wilferd Madelung]], Ali himself was firmly convinced of his legitimacy for [[caliphate]] based on his close kinship with Muhammad, his intimate association and his knowledge of Islam and his merits in serving its cause. He told Abu Bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') as caliph was based on his belief of his own prior title. Ali did not change his mind when he finally pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and to Uthman but had done so for the sake of the unity of Islam, at a time when it was clear that the Muslims had turned away from him.<ref name="Islam"/><ref>See:

===After Muhammad===
{{See also|Origin and development of the Quran}}
Another part of Ali's life started in 632 after the death of Muhammad and lasted until the assassination of Uthman Ibn Affan, the third caliph in 656. During those 24 years, Ali neither took part in any battle or [[Muslim conquests|conquest]],<ref name="Iranica"/> nor did he assume any executive position. He withdrew from political affairs, especially after the death of his wife, Fatimah Zahra. He used his time to serve his family and worked as a farmer. Ali dug a lot of wells and planted gardens near Medina and endowed them for public use. These wells are known today as ''[[Abar Ali]]'' ("Ali's wells").<ref>{{cite web|title=Abar Ali mosque|url=http://www.ircicaarchdata.org/ircica/level1.php?id=750|publisher=IRCICAARCH data|accessdate=23 May 2015}}</ref>

Ali compiled a complete version of the Quran, ''[[mus'haf]]'',<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last = Nasr |first = Seyyed Hossein|authorlink = Seyyed Hossein Nasr|title = Quran |year = 2007| encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate = 2007-11-04|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-68890/Quran| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016200056/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-68890/Quran| archivedate= October 16, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> six months after the death of Muhammad. The volume was completed and carried by camel to show to other people of Medina. The order of this ''mus'haf'' differed from that which was gathered later during the [[Uthman Ibn Affan|Uthmanic]] era. This book was rejected by several people when he showed it to them. Despite this, Ali made no resistance against ''[[Origin and development of the Quran#Standardization|standardised mus'haf]]''.<ref>See:

===Ali and the Rashidun caliphs===
{{See also|Rashidun|The election of Uthman}}
 	
At the beginning of Abu Bakr's caliphate, there was a controversy about Muhammad's endowment to his daughter, especially [[Fadak]], between Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other side. Fatimah asked Abu Bakr to turn over their property, the lands of [[Fadak]] and [[Khaybar]]. But Abu Bakr refused and told her that [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]] did not have any legacy and that Fadak belonged to the Muslim community. Abu Bakr said to her, "Allah's Apostle said, we do not have heirs, whatever we leave is [[Sadaqa]]." Together with [[Umm Ayman]], Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad granted it to Fatimah Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested her to summon witnesses for her claim. Fatimah became angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude until she died.

'Aisha also said that "When Allah's Apostle died, his wives intended to send 'Uthman to Abu Bakr asking him for their share of the inheritance."

According to some sources, Ali did not give his oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr until some time after the death of his wife, Fatimah in the year AD 633.<ref name="Iranica"/> Ali participated in the funeral of Abu Bakr.<ref>

He pledged allegiance to the second caliph [[Umar ibn Khattab]] and helped him as a trusted advisor. Umar particularly relied upon Ali as the chief judge of Medina. He also advised Umar to set Hijra as the beginning of the [[Islamic calendar]]. Umar used Ali's suggestions in political issues as well as religious ones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=107–110}}</ref>

Ali was one of [[The election of Uthman|the electoral council to choose the third caliph]] which was appointed by Umar. Although Ali was one of the two major candidates, the council's arrangement was against him. [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas]] and [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]], who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's brother-in-law. In addition, Umar gave the casting vote to Abdur Rahman. Abdur Rahman offered the caliphate to Ali on the condition that he should rule in accordance with the Quran, the [[Sunnah|example set by Muhammad]], and the precedents established by the first two caliphs. Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it. According to [[Comments on the Peak of Eloquence (Ibn Abi al-Hadid)|Ibn Abi al-Hadid's Comments on the Peak of Eloquence]] Ali insisted on his prominence there, but most of the electors supported Uthman and Ali was reluctantly urged to accept him.<ref>See:

====Siege of Uthman====
{{Main|Siege of Uthman}}

Uthman Ibn Affan expressed generosity toward his kin, [[Banu Abd-Shams]], who seemed to dominate him, and his supposed arrogant mistreatment toward several of the earliest companions such as [[Abu Dharr al-Ghifari]], [[Abd-Allah ibn Mas'ud]] and [[Ammar ibn Yasir]] provoked outrage among some groups of people. Dissatisfaction and resistance openly arose since 650–651 throughout most of the empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=87 and 88}}</ref> The dissatisfaction with his rule and the governments appointed by him was not restricted to the provinces outside [[Arabia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=90}}</ref> When Uthman's kin, especially [[Marwan I|Marwan]], gained control over him, the noble companions, including most of [[The election of Uthman|the members of elector council]], turned against him or at least withdrew their support, putting pressure on the caliph to mend his ways and reduce the influence of his assertive kin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=92–107}}</ref>

At this time, Ali had acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him. On several occasions Ali disagreed with Uthman in the application of the [[Hudud]]; he had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dharr al-Ghifari and had spoken strongly in the defence of Ammar ibn Yasir. He conveyed to Uthman the criticisms of other Companions and acted on Uthman's behalf as negotiator with the provincial opposition who had come to Medina; because of this some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family seems to have arisen. Finally, he tried to mitigate the severity of [[Siege of Uthman|the siege]] by his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water.<ref name="Iranica"/>

There is controversy among historians about the relationship between Ali and Uthman. Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies. In particular, he clashed with Uthman on the question of religious law. He insisted that [[Hudud|religious punishment]] had to be done in several cases such as [[Ubayd Allah ibn Umar]] and [[Walid ibn Uqba]]. In 650 during [[Hajj|pilgrimage]], he confronted Uthman with reproaches for his change of the prayer ritual. When Uthman declared that he would take whatever he needed from the [[fey']], Ali exclaimed that in that case the caliph would be prevented by force. Ali endeavoured to protect companions from maltreatment by the caliph such as [[Ibn Mas'ud]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=109 and 110}}</ref> Therefore, some historians consider Ali one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the main one. But [[Wilferd Madelung]] rejects their judgment due to the fact that Ali did not have the Quraysh's support to be elected as a caliph. According to him, there is even no evidence that Ali had close relations with rebels who supported his caliphate or directed their actions.
<ref>See:
* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|p=67 and 68}}
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=107 and 111}}
</ref> Some other sources say Ali had acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him.<ref name="Iranica"/> However, Madelung narrates [[Marwan I|Marwan]] told [[Zayn al-Abidin]], the grandson of Ali, that

===Election as caliph===

Ali was caliph between 656 and 661, during one of the most turbulent periods in Muslim history, which also coincided with the First Fitna.

Uthman's assassination meant that rebels had to select a new caliph. This met with difficulties since the rebels were divided into several groups comprising the ''[[Muhajirun]]'', ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'', [[Egypt]]ians, Kufans and [[Bassorah|Basrites]]. There were three candidates: Ali, [[Talhah]] and [[al-Zubayr]]. First the rebels approached Ali, requesting him to accept being the caliph. Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept the office,<ref name="Sermon 3">
* [[Nahj Al-Balagha]] [http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=3 Nahj Al-Balagha Sermon 3]

Talhah, Zubayr and other companions also refused the rebels' offer of the caliphate. Therefore, the rebels warned the inhabitants of Medina to select a caliph within one day, or they would apply drastic action. In order to resolve the deadlock, the Muslims gathered in the [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi|Mosque of the Prophet]] on June 18, 656 to appoint the caliph. Initially Ali refused to accept simply because his most vigorous supporters were rebels. However, when some notable companions of Muhammad, in addition to the residents of Medina, urged him to accept the offer, he finally agreed. According to [[Abu Mekhnaf]]'s narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to Ali, but other narrations claimed otherwise, stating they were forced to give their pledge. Also, Talhah and Zubayr later claimed they supported him reluctantly. Regardless, Ali refuted these claims, insisting they recognised him as caliph voluntarily. [[Wilferd Madelung]] believes that force did not urge people to give their pledge and they pledged publicly in the mosque.<ref name="Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120">{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=119 and 120}}</ref><ref name="Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145">{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=141–145}}</ref>

While the overwhelming majority of Medina's population as well as many of the rebels gave their pledge, some important figures or tribes did not do so. The Umayyads, kinsmen of Uthman, fled to the [[Levant]] or remained in their houses, later refusing Ali's legitimacy. [[Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas]] was absent and [[Abdullah ibn Umar]] abstained from offering his allegiance, but both of them assured Ali that they would not act against him.<ref name="Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120"/><ref name="Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145"/>

===Reign as caliph===

{{legend|#5200FA|Region under the control of [[Amr ibn al-As]] during the First Fitna}}]]

Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polemical sectarian historiography, biographical material is often biased. But the sources agree that he was a profoundly religious man, devoted to the cause of Islam and the rule of justice in accordance with the [[Quran]] and the [[Sunnah|Sunna]]; he engaged in war against erring Muslims as a matter of religious duty. The sources abound in notices on his austerity, rigorous observance of religious duties, and detachment from worldly goods. Thus some authors have pointed out that he lacked political skill and flexibility.<ref name="Iranica"/>

Ali inherited the Rashidun caliphate—which extended from Egypt in the west to the [[Iranian Plateau|Iranian highlands]] in the east—while the situation in the [[Hejaz]] and the other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled. Soon after Ali became caliph, he dismissed provincial governors who had been appointed by Uthman, replacing them with trusted aides. He acted against the counsel of [[Mughira ibn Shu'ba]] and [[Ibn Abbas]], who had advised him to proceed with his governing cautiously. Madelung says Ali was deeply convinced of his right and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for the sake of political expediency, and ready to fight against overwhelming odds.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=148 and 149}}</ref> Muawiyah I, the kinsman of Uthman and governor of the Levant, refused to submit to Ali's orders; he was the only governor to do so.<ref name="Iranica"/>

When he was appointed caliph, Ali stated to the citizens of Medina that Muslim polity had come to be plagued by dissension and discord; he desired to purge Islam of any evil. He advised the populace to behave as true Muslims, warning that he would tolerate no sedition and those who were found guilty of subversive activities would be dealt with harshly.<ref name="Ashraf (2005), p. 121">{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=121}}</ref> Ali recovered the land granted by Uthman and swore to recover anything that elites had acquired before his election. Ali opposed the centralisation of capital control over provincial revenues, favouring an equal distribution of [[Islamic tax|taxes]] and booty amongst the Muslim citizens; he distributed the entire revenue of the [[Bayt al-mal|treasury]] among them. Ali refrained from [[nepotism]], including with his brother [[Aqeel ibn Abu Talib]]. This was an indication to Muslims of his policy of offering equality to Muslims who served Islam in its early years and to the Muslims who played a role in the later [[Muslim conquests|conquests]].<ref name="Iranica"/><ref>See:

</ref>

[[File:Arabic caligraphic seal in Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|The name of ''Ali with [[Islamic calligraphy]].'']]
Ali succeeded in forming a broad coalition especially after the [[Battle of the Camel]]. His policy of equal distribution of taxes and booty gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the [[Qari|Qurra]] or Quran reciters that sought pious Islamic leadership. The successful formation of this diverse coalition seems to be due to Ali's charismatic character.<ref name="Iranica"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Shaban|1971|p=72}}</ref> This diverse coalition became known as ''Shi'a Ali'', meaning "party" or "faction of Ali". However, according to Shia, as well as non-Shia reports, the majority of those who supported Ali after his election as caliph, were shia politically, not religiously. Although at this time there were many who counted as political Shia, few of them believed Ali's religious leadership.<ref>{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=63}}</ref>

===First Fitna===
{{Campaignbox First Fitna}}
{{See also|First Fitna}}

[[A'isha]], [[Talhah]], [[Al-Zubayr]] and the Umayyads, especially [[Muawiyah I]] and [[Marwan I]], wanted Ali to punish the rioters who had killed [[Uthman]]. They wanted Ali to arrest [[Uthman ibn Affan]]'s killer and not to fight [[Muawiyah I]].<ref name="Nahj al Balagha Sermon 72">[http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=72 Nahj al Balagha Sermon 72]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&pg=PA131&dq=battle+of+the+camel,+Muawiya+and+marwan&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7Q4lUeiNDaO80QWBlYGgDw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=battle%20of%20the%20camel%2C%20Muawiya%20and%20marwan&f=false|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization|publisher=}}</ref> They encamped close to Basra.

</ref>

However some historians believe that they used this issue to seek their political ambitions because they found Ali's caliphate against their own benefit. On the other hand, the rebels maintained that Uthman had been justly killed, for not governing according to Quran and Sunnah, hence no vengeance was to be invoked.<ref name="Iranica"/><ref name="Tabatabae191"/><ref>See:
* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=147 and 148}}
* {{Harvnb|Lewis|1991|p=214}}</ref> 
Historians disagree on Ali's position. Some say the caliphate was a gift of the rebels and Ali did not have enough force to control or punish them,<ref name="Ashraf (2005), p. 121"/> while others say Ali accepted the rebels' argument or at least did not consider Uthman a just ruler.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|1991|p=214}}</ref>

Under such circumstances, a schism took place which led to the first civil war in Muslim history. Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman a rightful and just [[caliph]] till the end, who had been unlawfully killed. Some others, who are known as party of Ali, believed Uthman had fallen into error, he had forfeited the caliphate and been lawfully executed for his refusal to mend his ways or step down; thus Ali was the just and true Imam and his opponents are infidels. It is important to note that this was not the position of Ali himself. This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community regarding who had the legitimate right to occupy the caliphate.<ref>See:
* {{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=47}}
* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|p=72}}
* {{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=57}}</ref>

The First Fitna, 656–661, followed the assassination of [[Uthman]], continued during the caliphate of Ali, and was ended by Muawiyah's assumption of the caliphate. This civil war (often called the ''[[Fitna (word)|Fitna]]'') is regretted as the end of the early unity of the Islamic ummah (nation).<ref>See:

Following the [[Roman-Persian Wars]] and the [[Byzantine–Sasanian wars]] that lasted for hundreds of years, there were deep rooted differences between Iraq, formally under the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] and Syria formally under the [[Byzantine]] Empire. The Iraqis wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in Kufa so as to bring revenues into their area and oppose Syria.<ref name="Iraq a Complicated State p. 32">Iraq a Complicated State: Iraq's Freedom War By Karim M. S. Al-Zubaidi, p. 32</ref> They convinced Ali to come to Kufa and establish the capital in Kufa, in Iraq.<ref name="Iraq a Complicated State p. 32"/>

Later Muawiyah I, the governor of Levant and the cousin of [[Uthman]], refused Ali's demands for allegiance. Ali opened negotiations hoping to regain his allegiance, but Muawiyah insisted on Levant autonomy under his rule. Muawiyah replied by mobilising his Levantine supporters and refusing to pay homage to Ali on the pretext that his contingent had not participated in his election. Ali then moved his armies north and the two armies encamped themselves at [[Siffin]] for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Although Ali exchanged several letters with Muawiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuade him to pledge allegiance. Skirmishes between the parties led to the [[Battle of Siffin]] in 657.<ref name="Iranica"/><ref name="lapidus47">See:

After a week of combat was followed by a violent battle known as ''laylat al-harir'' (the night of clamour), Muawiyah's army was on the point of being routed when [[Amr ibn al-Aas]] advised Muawiyah to have his soldiers hoist ''[[mus'haf]]'' (either parchments inscribed with verses of the Quran, or complete copies of it) on their spearheads in order to cause disagreement and confusion in Ali's army.<ref name="Iranica"/><ref name="lapidus47"/> Ali saw through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to pursue the fight.<ref name="Islam"/>

The two armies finally agreed to settle the matter of who should be caliph by arbitration. The refusal of the largest bloc in Ali's army to fight was the decisive factor in his acceptance of the arbitration. The question as to whether the arbiter would represent Ali or the Kufans caused a further split in Ali's army. [[Ash'ath ibn Qays]] and some others rejected Ali's nominees, [['Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas]] and [[Malik al-Ashtar]], and insisted on [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]], for his neutrality. Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa. [[Amr ibn al-As]] was appointed by Muawiyah as an arbitrator. Seven months later the two arbitrators met at Adhruh about 10 miles north west of Maan in Jordan in February 658. [[Amr ibn al-As]] convinced [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]] that both Ali and Muawiyah should step down and a new caliph be elected. Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision which had lowered the caliph to the status of the rebellious Muawiyah. Ali was therefore outwitted by Muawiyah and [[Amr ibn al-As]].<ref>Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia edited by [[Alexander Mikaberidze]] Page 836 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jBBYD2J2oE4C&pg=PA836&dq=Muawiyah+ali+at+Siffin&hl=en&sa=X&ei=v18mUfCsC-Om0AX99IDQBQ#v=onepage&q=Muawiyah%20ali%20at%20Siffin&f=false]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&pg=PA602&dq=Muawiyah+ali+at+Siffin&hl=en&sa=X&ei=v18mUfCsC-Om0AX99IDQBQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Muawiyah%20ali%20at%20Siffin&f=false|title=Ground Warfare|publisher=}}</ref>

When the arbitrators assembled at [[Daumet-ul-Jandal]], a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss the matters in hand. When the time arrived for taking a decision about the [[caliphate]], Amr bin al-A'as convinced [[Abu Musa al-Ashari]] into entertaining the opinion that they should deprive both Ali and Muawiya of the caliphate, and give to the Muslims the right to elect the caliph. Abu Musa al-Ashari also decided to act accordingly.<ref name="autogenerated16">A Chronology of Islamic History 570-1000 CE By H U Rahman Page 59</ref> According to Poonawala, it seems that the arbiters and other eminent persons, with the exclusion of Ali’s representatives, met in January 659 to discuss the selection of the new caliph. Amr supported Muawiyah, while Abu Musa preferred his son-in-law, [[Abdullah ibn Umar]], but the latter refused to stand for election in default of unanimity. Abu Musa then proposed, and Amr agreed, to depose both Ali and Muawiyah and submit the selection of the new caliph to a [[Shura]]. In the public declaration that followed Abu Musa observed his part of the agreement, but Amr declared Ali deposed and confirmed Muawiya as caliph.<ref name="Iranica"/>

Ali refused to accept the verdict of him stepping down and for an election to be held and found himself technically in breach of his pledge to abide by the arbitration.<ref name="autogenerated17">A Chronology of Islamic History 570-1000 CE By H U Rahman Page 60</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Mikaberidze| first = Alexander| title = Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes] A Historical Encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/?id=jBBYD2J2oE4C&pg=PA836| year = 2011| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-59884-337-8| page = 836 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Sandler| first = Stanley| title = Ground Warfare An International Encyclopedia| url = https://books.google.com/?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&pg=PA602| accessdate = 2013-04-30| year = 2002| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-57607-344-5 }}</ref> Ali protested, stating that it was contrary to the Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] and hence not binding.

The most vociferous opponents in Ali's camp were the very same people who had forced Ali into the ceasefire. They broke away from Ali's force, rallying under the slogan "arbitration belongs to God alone." This group came to be known as the [[Kharijites]] ("those who leave"). They considered everyone to be their enemy. In 659 Ali's forces and the [[Kharijites]] met in the [[Battle of Nahrawan]].<ref name="autogenerated16"/><ref name="autogenerated16"/><ref>Timani, Hussam S. (2008).

The Kharijites then started killing Ali's supporters and other Muslims. They considered anyone who was not part of their group as an unbeliever.<ref name="google62"/>

In 659 Ali's forces finally moved against the Kharijites and they finally met in the [[Battle of Nahrawan]]. Although Ali won the battle by a huge margin, the constant conflict had begun to affect his standing.<ref name="autogenerated16"/> While dealing with the Iraqis, Ali found it hard to build a disciplined army and effective state institutions. He also spent a lot of time fighting the [[Kharijites]]. As a result, Ali found it hard to expand the state on its eastern front.<ref name="autogenerated1">A Chronology of Islamic History 570-1000 By H. U. Rahman</ref>

At about the same time, unrest was brewing in Egypt. The governor of Egypt, Qais, was recalled, and Ali had him replaced with [[Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr]] (the brother of Aisha and the son of Islam's first caliph Abu Bakr). Muawiyah allowed [['Amr ibn al-'As]] to conquer Egypt and 'Amr did so successfully.<ref name="autogenerated18">A Chronology of Islamic History 570-1000 By H. U.

In the following years Muawiyah's army occupied many cities of Iraq, which Ali's governors could not prevent, and people did not support him to fight with them. Muawiyah overpowered Egypt, [[Hijaz]], Yemen and other areas.<ref>

</ref> In the last year of Ali's caliphate, the mood in Kufa and Basra changed in his favour as the people became disillusioned with Muawiyah's reign and policies. However, the people's attitude toward Ali differed deeply. Just a small minority of them believed that Ali was the best Muslim after Muhammad and the only one entitled to rule them, while the majority supported him due to their distrust and opposition to Muawiyah.<ref name="Madelung 1997 p=309">{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=309}}</ref>

====Policies====
What shows Ali's policies and ideas of governing is his instruction to [[Malik al-Ashtar]], when appointed by him as governor of Egypt. This instruction, which is considered by many Muslims and even non-Muslims as the ideal constitution for Islamic governance, involved detailed description of duties and rights of the ruler and various functionaries of the state and the main classes of society at that time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shah-Kazemi|2007|p=81}}</ref><ref>United Nations Development Program, Arab human development report, (2002), p. 107</ref>{{quotation needed|date = August 2013}}

Ali wrote in his instruction to Malik al-Ashtar:

{{quote|text=Infuse your heart with mercy, love and kindness for your subjects. Be not in face of them a voracious animal, counting them as easy prey, for they are of two kinds: either they are your brothers in religion or your equals in creation. Error catches them unaware, deficiencies overcome them, (evil deeds) are committed by them intentionally and by mistake. So grant them your pardon and your forgiveness to the same extent that you hope God will grant you His pardon and His forgiveness. For you are above them, and he who appointed you is above you, and God is above him who appointed you. God has sought from you the fulfillment of their requirements and He is trying you with them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1989|p=75}}</ref>}}

Since the majority of Ali's subjects were nomads and peasants, he was concerned with agriculture. He instructed to Malik to give more attention to development of the land than to the collection of the tax, because tax can only be obtained by the development of the land and whoever demands tax without developing the land ruins the country and destroys the people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lambton|1991|p=xix and xx}}</ref>
[[File:Meshed ali usnavy (PD).jpg|thumb|This mosque in [[Najaf|an-Najaf]], Iraq, is widely considered by Shias to be the final burial place of Ali.]]

===Death===
{{main|Assassination of Ali}}
On 19 Ramadan 40 AH, which would correspond to 27 January AD 661, while praying in the [[Great Mosque of Kufa]], Ali was attacked by the [[Kharijite]] [[Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam]]. He was wounded by ibn Muljam's poison-coated sword while prostrating in the Fajr prayer.<ref name="Tabatabaei 1979 192">{{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=192}}</ref>
Ali ordered his sons not to attack the Kharijites, instead stipulating that if he survived, ibn Muljam would be pardoned whereas if he died, ibn Muljam should be given only one equal hit (regardless of whether or not he died from the hit).<ref>{{Harvnb|Kelsay|1993|p=92}}</ref>

Ali died two days later on 29 January AD 661 (21 Ramadan 40 A.H).<ref name="Iranica"/><ref name="Tabatabaei 1979 192"/> Hasan fulfilled [[Qisas]] and gave equal punishment to ibn Muljam upon Ali's death.<ref name="Madelung 1997 p=309"/>

===Burial===
[[File:Imam ali's shrine, Arbaeen 2015.JPG|thumb|Ali's [[shrine]] in [[Arbaeen]] 2015.]]

According to [[Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid]], Ali did not want his grave to be desecrated by his enemies and consequently asked his friends and family to bury him secretly. This secret gravesite was revealed later during the Abbasid caliphate by [[Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq]], his descendant and the sixth Shia Imam.<ref>{{Harvnb|Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid|1986|p=}}</ref> Most Shias accept that Ali is buried at the Tomb of Imam Ali in the [[Imam Ali Mosque]] at what is now the city of [[Najaf]], which grew around the mosque and shrine called Masjid Ali.<ref name="Imam Ali Ibn Abu Talib">{{Harvnb|Redha|1999|p=}}</ref><ref name="Medieval"/>

[[File:InsideImamAliMosqueNajafIraq.JPG|thumb|Inside view of [[Imam Ali Mosque|Imām Alī Shrine]] (before the renovations in 2008)]]
After Ali's death, Kufi Muslims pledged allegiance to his eldest son Hasan without dispute, as Ali on many occasions had declared that just [[Ahl al-Bayt|People of the House]] of Muhammad were entitled to rule the Muslim community.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=313 and 314}}</ref>
At this time, Muawiyah held both the Levant and Egypt and, as commander of the largest force in the Muslim Empire, had declared himself caliph and marched his army into Iraq, the seat of Hasan's caliphate.

War ensued during which Muawiyah gradually subverted the generals and commanders of Hasan's army with large sums of money and deceiving promises until the army rebelled against him. Finally, Hasan was forced to make peace and to yield the caliphate to Muawiyah. In this way Muawiyah captured the Islamic caliphate and tuned it to a secular kingdom ([[Sultanate]]). Umayyad caliphate later became a centralised monarchy by [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=319–325}}

Umayyads placed the severest pressure upon Ali's family and his [[Shia]], in every way possible. Regular public cursing of Imam Ali in the [[Salat#Prayer in congregation|congregational prayers]] remained a vital institution which was not abolished until 60 years later by [[Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz]]. 
<ref name="Madelung 1997 334"/>

Madelung writes:
<blockquote>Umayyad highhandedness, misrule and repression were gradually to turn the minority of Ali's admirers into a majority. In the memory of later generations Ali became the ideal [[Commander of the Faithful]]. In face of the fake Umayyad claim to legitimate sovereignty in Islam as God's Vice-regents on earth, and in view of Umayyad treachery, arbitrary and divisive government, and vindictive retribution, they came to appreciate his [Ali's] honesty, his unbending devotion to the reign of Islam, his deep personal loyalties, his equal treatment of all his supporters, and his generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies.<ref name="Madelung 1997 p=309 and 310"/></blockquote>

==Knowledge==
{{See also|Nahj al-Balagha}}
Ali is respected not only as a warrior and leader, but as a writer and religious authority. A numerous range of disciplines from [[Kalam|theology]] and [[Tafsir|exegesis]] to [[Calligraphy#Islamic|calligraphy]] and [[numerology]], from [[Shariah|law]] and mysticism to [[Arabic grammar]] and [[rhetoric]] are regarded as having been first adumbrated by Ali.<ref name="Medieval">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Shah-Kazemi |first=Reza|title='Ali ibn Abu Talib |year=2006|encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-04-02 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-415-96691-7 }}, Pages 36 and 37</ref>
According to a Hadith which is narrated by Shia and Sufis, Muhammad told about him "I'm the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate..."<ref name="Medieval"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.spiritualfoundation.net/sayingsofhadratali.htm World of Tasawwuf]</ref> Muslims regard Ali as a major authority on Islam. Ali himself gives this testimony:
<blockquote>Not a single [[Ayah|verse]] of the Quran [[Wahy|descended]] upon (was revealed to) the Messenger of God which he did not proceed to dictate to me and make me [[Qira'at|recite]]. I would [[Mushaf|write it with my own hand]], and he would instruct me as to its ''tafsir'' (the literal explanation)
and the ''[[ta'wil]]'' (the spiritual exegesis), the ''[[Naskh (tafsir)|nasikh]]'' (the verse which abrogates) and the ''[[mansukh]]'' (the abrogated verse), the ''[[Muhkam (tafsir)|muhkam]]'' and the ''[[mutashabih]]'' (the fixed and the ambiguous), the particular and the general...<ref>{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=46}}
</ref></blockquote>

According to [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], Ali is credited with having established [[Kalam|Islamic theology]] and his quotations contain the first rational proofs among Muslims of the [[Tawhid|Unity of God]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=120}}</ref> [[Ibn Abi al-Hadid]] has quoted
<blockquote>As for theosophy and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art. Nothing of the sort had been circulated among their distinguished figures or those of lower ranks. This art was the exclusive preserve of Greece, whose sages were its only expounders. The first one among Arabs to deal with it was Ali.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1996|p=136}}</ref></blockquote>

In later [[Islamic philosophy]], especially in the teachings of [[Mulla Sadra]] and his followers, like Allameh Tabatabaei, Ali's sayings and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of metaphysical knowledge, or divine philosophy. Members of [[Transcendent Theosophy|Sadra's school]] regard Ali as the supreme metaphysician of Islam.<ref name="Britannica"/> According to Henry Corbin, the ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' may be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines professed by Shia thinkers, especially after AD 1500. Its influence can be sensed in the logical co-ordination of terms, the deduction of correct conclusions, and the creation of certain technical terms in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] which entered the literary and [[Philosophy|philosophical language]] independently of the translation into Arabic of [[Greek language|Greek]] texts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=35}}</ref>

Ali was also a great scholar of [[Arabic literature]] and pioneered in the field of Arabic grammar and rhetoric. Numerous short sayings of Ali have become part of general Islamic culture and are quoted as aphorisms and proverbs in daily life. They have also become the basis of literary works or have been integrated into poetic verse in many languages. Already in the 8th century, literary authorities such as [['Abd al-Hamid ibn Yahya al-'Amiri]] pointed to the unparalleled eloquence of Ali's sermons and sayings, as did [[al-Jahiz]] in the following century.<ref name="Britannica"/> Even staffs in the [[Divan]] of Umayyad recited Ali's sermons to improve their eloquence.<ref>"حفظت سبعين خطبة من خطب الاصلع ففاضت ثم فاضت ) ويعني بالاصلع أمير المؤمنين عليا عليه السلام " [http://books.rafed.net/turathona/5/ts2.html مقدمة في مصادر نهج البلاغة]</ref> Of course, ''Peak of Eloquence'' (''Nahj al-Balagha'') is an extract of Ali's quotations from a literal viewpoint as its compiler mentioned in the preface, while there are many other quotations, prayers ([[Du'a]]s), sermons and letters in other literal, historic and religious books.<ref>See:
* [http://www.islamology.com/Resources/Nahj_Imam/Sermons/bookE/sources.htm Sources of Nahj Al-Balagha]
</ref>

In addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as ''[[jafr]]'', Islamic [[numerology]], and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]], are said to have been established by Ali<ref name="Britannica"/> through his having studied the texts of [[Al-Jafr (book)|al-Jafr]] and [[al-Jamia]].

===Works===

The compilation of sermons, lectures and quotations attributed to Ali are compiled in the form of several books.

==Descendants==
{{Main|Descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib|Alavi (surname)}}

Ali initially married Fatimah, who was his most beloved wife. After she died, he got married again.  He had four children with [[Fatimah]], [[Hasan ibn Ali]], [[Husayn ibn Ali]], [[Zaynab bint Ali]]<ref name="Britannica"/> and [[Umm Kulthum bint Ali]]. His other well-known sons were [[al-Abbas ibn Ali]], born to [[Fatima binte Hizam]] (Um al-Banin), and [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Stearns|Langer|2001|p=1178}}</ref> Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah was Ali's son from another wife from Hanifa clan of central Arabia named [[Khawlah bint Ja'far]].<ref>After Fatima's death, Ali married Khawla bint Ja'far of the Bani Hanifa tribe (source: [http://islamichistory.files.wordpress.com/2007/03/ali-muawiya.ppt ali-muawiya])</ref>

Hasan, born in AD 625, was the second Shia Imam and he also occupied the outward function of caliph for about six months. In the year 50 A.H., he was poisoned and killed by a member of his own household who, as has been accounted by historians, had been motivated by Mu'awiyah.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=194}}</ref>

Husayn, born in AD 626, was the third Shia Imam. He lived under severe conditions of suppression and persecution by Mu'awiyah. On the tenth day of [[Muharram]], of the year 680, he lined up before the army of the caliph with his small band of followers and nearly all of them were killed in the [[Battle of Karbala]]. The anniversary of his death is called the [[Day of Ashura]] and it is a day of mourning and religious observance for Shia Muslims.<ref>
{{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|pp=196–201}}</ref> In this battle some of Ali's other sons were killed. [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Al-Tabari]] has mentioned their names in his history: Al-Abbas ibn Ali, the holder of Husayn's standard, Ja'far, Abdallah and Uthman, the four sons born to Fatima binte Hizam; Muhammad and Abu Bakr. The death of the last one is doubtful.<ref>{{Harvnb|Al-Tabari|1990|pp=vol.XIX pp. 178–179}}</ref>
Some historians have added the names of Ali's other sons who were killed at Karbala, including Ibrahim, Umar and Abdallah ibn al-Asqar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aashura.tripod.com/martyrs.htm|title=Karbala's Martyrs|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.velaiat.com/shshow.asp?rsabs=43&id=kash List of Martyrs of Karbala] by Khansari "فرزندان اميراالمؤمنين(ع):

Ali's descendants by Fatimah are known as ''[[sharif]]s'', ''sayeds'' or ''[[sayyid]]s''. These are honorific titles in Arabic, ''sharif'' meaning 'noble' and ''sayed'' or ''sayyid'' meaning 'lord' or 'sir'.

===Muslim views===

Except for Muhammad, there is no one in Islamic history about whom as much has been written in Islamic languages as Ali.<ref name="Britannica"/>

In [[Islamic culture|Muslim culture]], Ali is respected for his courage, knowledge, belief, honesty, unbending devotion to Islam, deep loyalty to Muhammad, equal treatment of all Muslims and generosity in forgiving his defeated enemies, and therefore is central to mystical traditions in Islam such as [[Sufism]]. Ali retains his stature as an authority on [[Tafsir|Quranic exegesis]], [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]] and religious thought.<ref name="Madelung 1997 p=309 and 310">{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=309 and 310}}</ref> Ali holds a high position in almost all Sufi orders which trace their lineage through him to Muhammad.

This is supported by numerous Hadiths which have been narrated by Shias, including [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm]], [[Hadith of the two weighty things]], [[Hadith of the pen and paper]], [[Hadith of the Cloak]], [[Hadith of position]], [[Hadith of the invitation of the close families]], and [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]].
 
According to this view, Ali as the successor of Muhammad not only ruled over the community in justice, but also interpreted the [[Sharia]] Law and its [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric meaning]]. Hence he was regarded as being free from error and sin ([[Infallible#Islamic Beliefs|infallible]]), and appointed by God by divine decree ([[Nass (Islam)|nass]]) through Muhammad.<ref name="Nasr 1979 10">{{Harvnb|Nasr|1979|p=10}} preface</ref> It is believed in Twelver and [[Ismaili]] Shī‘ah Islam that [[Aql (Shiasm)|‘aql]], divine wisdom, was the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gave them esoteric knowledge called ''ḥikmah'' and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees.<ref name="Britannica"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Nasr|1979|p=15}} preface</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|pp=45–51}}</ref> Although the Imam was not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people.

====Sunni====
{{Main|Sunni view of Ali}}
 
Sunnis view Ali as one of the greatest warrior champions of Islam. Examples include taking on the Quraish champion at the [[Battle of the Trench]] when nobody else dared. After multiple failed attempts of breaking the fort in the [[Battle of Khaybar]], Ali was summoned, miraculously healed and conquered the fort.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ali|url=http://www.sunnah.org/publication/khulafa_rashideen/caliph4.htm|publisher=Sunnah|accessdate=14 May 2015}}</ref>

====Sufi====
Almost all Sufi orders trace their lineage to Muhammad through Ali, an exception being [[Naqshbandi]], who go through Abu Bakr. Even in this order, there is [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the great great grandson of Ali. Sufis believe that Ali inherited from Muhammad the saintly power ''[[Wali|wilayah]]'' that makes the [[Sulook|spiritual journey]] to God possible.<ref name="Britannica"/>
 
Eminent Sufis such as [[Ali Hujwiri]] claim that the tradition began with Ali and [[Junayd of Baghdad]] regarded Ali as the [[Sheikh]] of the principles and practices of Sufism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alim.org/library/biography/khalifa/content/KAL/79/1 |title=Khalifa Ali bin Abu Talib - Ali, The Father of Sufism |publisher=Alim.org |accessdate=2013-12-31}}</ref>
 
Sufis recite ''[[Manqabat]]'' Ali in the praise of Ali.

====Titles====
Ali is known by various titles, some given due to his personal qualities and others due to events in his life:<ref name="Britannica"/>
*''Al-Murtadha'' ("The Chosen One")
*''Amir Al-Mu'minin'' ("Commander of the Faithful")
*''Bab-e-Madinatul-Ilm'' ("Door to the City of Knowledge")
*''[[Abu Turab]]'' ("Father of the Soil")
*''Asadullah'' ("Lion of God")
*''Haydar'' ("Braveheart")

===As a "deity"===
{{Main|Ghulat}}
 
Ali is recorded in some traditions as having forbidden those who sought to worship him in his own lifetime.<ref name="Peters 2003 320–321">See:
* {{Harvnb|Peters|2003|pp=320–321}}
* {{Harvnb|Halm|2004|pp=154–159}}</ref>

====Alawites====
Some groups such as the [[Alawites]] (Nuṣayrī Arabic: نصيرية) are claimed to believe that Ali was God [[Incarnation|incarnate]]. They are described as ''ghulat'' ([[Arabic language|Ar]]: غُلاة) "exaggerators" by the majority of Islamic scholars. These groups have, according to traditionalist Muslims, left Islam due to their exaggeration of a human being's praiseworthy traits.<ref name="Peters 2003 320–321"/>

====Ali-Illahism====
In [[Ali-Illahism]] a syncretic religion centres on the belief that there have been successive [[incarnations]] of their [[Deity]] throughout history, and reserves particular reverence for Ali, the son-in-law of Muhammad, who is considered one such incarnation.<ref>Layard, Austen Henry, Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, Page 216</ref>

====Druze====
The [[Druze]] believe that God was [[incarnation|incarnated]] in human beings, especially Ali and his descendants, including [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]].

===Ali in the Quran===
{{main|Ali in the Quran}}

The majority of Islamic commentators do not believe Ali is mentioned by name in the Quran.{{efn| An exception is in [[Alhazen|Ibn al-Haytham]]'s Kitab al-Munazarat, there is a specific mention of the words Aliyyan, Aliyyun and Alayya in the [[Quran]] which, he believe, according to grammatical rules are the names to Ali. Examples of these, he says, are the following verses: ''In the (mother of the Book which is with Us, he is Ali, full of wisdom'';{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#43:4 Quran, 43: 4]}} ''We appointed for them Ali as a voice of truth'';{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#19:50 Quran, 19: 50]}} and ''This is the straight path of Ali''{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#15:41 Quran, 15: 41]}}<ref name="Leaman"/> }}<ref name="Leaman"/> However, there are many verses interpreted by Shiite scholars as referring to Ali or other [[Shiite]] [[Imam]]s. Responding to this question that why the names of the Imams are not mentioned in Quran expressly [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] answers: "Allah revealed [[Salat]] to his Prophet but never said of three or four [[Rakat]]s, revealed [[Zakat]] but did not mention to its details, revealed [[Hajj]] but did not count its [[Tawaf]] and the Prophet interpreted their details. Allah revealed this verse and Prophet said this verse is about Ali, [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]], [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] and other the twelve Imams."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naseri|first1=AliAkbar|title=Imamat and Shifa’at|pages=203–204}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Feyrahi|first1=Davoud|title=General coordinates of Imaamat|journal=Shia Studies Quarterly|issue=3 and 4|url=http://farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8406130237}}</ref>
According to Ali one quarter of [[Quran]]ic verses are stating the station of Imams. Momen has listed many of these verses in his ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam''.<ref name="Leaman"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|pp=150–151}}</ref> However, there are few verses that some Sunni commentators interpret as referring to Ali, among which are [[The verse of Wilayah]] ([http://tanzil.net/#5:55 Quran, 5:55]) that Sunni and Shiite scholars {{efn|See at-Tabari: at-Tarikh, vol.6, p.186; as-Suyuti: ad-Durru 'lmanthur, vol.2, pp.293-4; ar-Razi: at-Tafsiru 'l Kabir, vol.12, p.26: az-Zamakhshari: at-Tafsir al-Kashshaf, vol.1, p.469; al-Jassas:Ahkamu 'l-Quran, vol.2, pp.542-3; al-khazin: at-Tafsir, vol.2, p.68 Imamate: The vicegerency of the Holy Prophet By Sayyid Saeed Akhtar Rizv p24 }} believe refers to the incident where Ali gave his ring to a beggar who asked for [[alms]] while performing [[Salat|ritual prayers]] in the [[mosque]].<ref name="Rizvi1988">{{cite book|author=Akhtar Rizvi, Sayyid Saeed|title=Imamate: The vicegerency of the Holy Prophet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0f2qAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA24|year=1988|publisher=Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania|isbn=978-9976-956-13-9|pages=24–}}</ref><ref name="CornilleConway2010">{{cite book|author1=Cornille, Catherine|author2=Conway, Christopher|title=Interreligious Hermeneutics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZpcNBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT124|date=1 July 2010|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=978-1-63087-425-4|pages=124–}}</ref>
[[The verse of Mawadda]] ([http://tanzil.net/#42:23 Quran, 42:23]) is another verse which Shiite scholar along with Sunni ones like [[Al-Baydawi]] and [[Al-Zamakhshari]] and [[Fakhr ad-Din ar-Razi]] believe that the phrase Kinship refers to Ali, [[Fatimah]] and their sons, [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=152}}</ref><ref name="mavani">{{cite book|last1=Hamid|first1=Mavani|title=Religious Authority and Political Thought in Twelver Shi'ism|pp=68–73|date=2013|publisher=New York and London: Routledge|isbn=978-0415624404}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Al-Bidāya wa-n-nihāya | publisher=Dar al-kotob al-Elmie | author=[[Ibn Kathir]] | volume=5 | page=245}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=[[Tafsir al-Tabari]] | publisher=Dar al-fekr Publication | author=[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] | volume=13 | page=27}}</ref>
[[The verse of purification]] ([http://tanzil.net/#33:33 Quran, 33:33]) is also among the verses both Sunni and Shiite conjoined the name of Ali with it along with some other names.{{efn|see al-Bahrani, Ghayat al-Marum, p. 126:al-Suyuti, al-Durr al-Manthur, Vol. V, p.199; Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al Musnad, Vol. I, p.331; Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, al-Tafsir al-Kabir, Vol. I, p.783; Ibn Hajar, al-Sawa'iq p.85 }}<ref name="Leaman"/><ref name="mavani" /><ref>Sahih Muslim, ''Chapter of virtues of companions, section of the virtues of the Ahlul-Bayt of the Prophet,'' 1980 Edition Pub. in Saudi Arabia, Arabic version, v4, p1883, Tradition #61</ref><ref>Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari.

==Historiography==
{{See also|Historiography of early Islam}}
The [[primary sources]] for scholarship on the life of Ali are the [[Quran]] and the Hadith, as well as other [[Historiography of early Islam|texts of early Islamic history]]. The extensive [[secondary source]]s include, in addition to works by Sunni and Shī‘a Muslims, writings by [[Christian Arabs]], [[Hindus]], and other non-Muslims from the Middle East and Asia and a few works by modern western scholars. However, many of the early Islamic sources are coloured to some extent by a positive or negative bias towards Ali.<ref name="Britannica"/>

There had been a common tendency among the earlier western scholars against these narrations and reports gathered in later periods due to their tendency towards later Sunni and Shī‘a partisan positions; such scholars regarding them as later fabrications. This leads them to regard certain reported events as inauthentic or irrelevant. [[Leone Caetani]] considered the attribution of historical reports to [[`Abd Allah ibn `Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] and Aisha as mostly fictitious while proffering accounts reported without ''[[isnad]]'' by the early compilers of history like Ibn Ishaq. Wilferd Madelung has rejected the stance of indiscriminately dismissing everything not included in "early sources" and in this approach tendentiousness alone is no evidence for late origin. According to him, Caetani's approach is inconsistent. Madelung and some later historians do not reject the narrations which have been complied in later periods and try to judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with the events and figures.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=xi, 19 and 20}}</ref>

Until the rise of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], few books were written and most of the reports had been oral. The most notable work previous to this period is ''[[The Book of Sulaym ibn Qays]]'', written by [[Sulaym ibn Qays]], a companion of Ali who lived before the Abbasid.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lawson|2005|p=59}}</ref> When paper was introduced to Muslim society, numerous monographs were written between AD 750 and 950. According to Robinson, at least twenty-one separate monographs have been composed on the Battle of Siffin. [[Abi Mikhnaf]] is one of the most renowned writers of this period who tried to gather all of the reports. 9th and 10th century historians collected, selected and arranged the available narrations. However, most of these monographs do not exist any more except for a few which have been used in later works such as [[History of the Prophets and Kings]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] (d.923).<ref>{{Harvnb|Robinson|2003|p=28 and 34}}</ref>

Shia of Iraq actively participated in writing monographs but most of those works have been lost. On the other hand, in the 8th and 9th century Ali's descendants such as [[Muhammad al Baqir]] and [[Jafar as Sadiq]] narrated his quotations and reports which have been gathered in Shia hadith books. The later Shia works written after the 10th century AD are about biographies of [[The Fourteen Infallibles]] and [[Twelve Imams]]. The earliest surviving work and one of the most important works in this field is ''[[Kitab al-Irshad]]'' by [[Shaykh Mufid]] (d. 1022). The author has dedicated the first part of his book to a detailed account of Ali. There are also some books known as ''Manāqib'' which describe Ali's character from a religious viewpoint. Such works also constitute a kind of historiography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/message-thaqalayn/general-message-thaqalayn/glance-historiography-shiite-culture-rasul-jafariyan|title=A Glance at Historiography in Shiite Culture|work=Al-Islam.org}}</ref>
