It commonly applies to countries once colonized by Spain, particularly the countries of [[Latin America]], and the [[Philippines]]. It could be argued that the term should apply to all Spanish-speaking cultures or countries, as the historical roots of the word specifically pertain to the Iberian region. It is difficult to label a nation or culture with one term, such as ''Hispanic,'' as the ethnicities, customs, traditions, and art forms (music, literature, dress, architecture, cuisine, and others) vary greatly by country and region. The [[Spanish language]] and Spanish culture are the main traditions.<ref name="fhwa.dot.gov"/><ref name="SBA 8005"/>

''Hispanic'' originally referred to the people of ancient Roman [[Hispania]], which roughly comprised the [[Iberian Peninsula]] including the contemporary states of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Andorra]], and the [[British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Vega |first=Noé Villaverde |title=Tingitana en la antigüedad tardía, siglos III-VII: autoctonía y romanidad en el extremo occidente mediterráneo |trans_title=Tingitana in late antiquity, the III-VII centuries: the autochthonous and Roman world in the west end of the Mediterranean |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HdPYaA4nG8QC&pg=PA266&dq=Nova+Hispania+Ulterior+Tingitana.&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ei=CddQUbSXNoe7hAeL44GIDQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=Nova%20Hispania%20Ulterior%20Tingitana.&f=false |year=2001 |publisher=[[Real Academia de la Historia]] |language=Spanish |isbn=978-84-89512-94-8 |page=266 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bowersock |first1=Glen Warren |last2=Brown |first2=Peter |last3=Grabar |first3=Oleg |title=Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c788wWR_bLwC&pg=PA504&dq=hispania+tingitania&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ei=JjZSUdhekoDtBs6IgOgK&ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=hispania%20tingitania&f=false |date=1999 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-51173-6 |page=504 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Corfis |first=Ivy A. |title=Al-Andalus, Sepharad and Medieval Iberia: Cultural Contact and Diffusion |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12w3qo2hkq4C&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=provinces++Hispania,++Tingitania&source=bl&ots=xw5lURJH3e&sig=NeXsOBaRK3hL1E-r2nYKI3aPp2w&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ei=EDhSUf7yIvGO7AaB2oCADg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=provinces%20%20Hispania%2C%20%20Tingitania&f=false|date=2009 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-17919-4 |page=231 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>

The term ''Hispanic'' derives from ''Hispanicus'' (which derived from ''Hispania''), ''Hispania'' may in turn derive from Latin ''Hispanicus'', or from [[Greek language|Greek]] Ισπανία ''Hispania'' and Ισπανός ''Hispanos'', probably from [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]]<ref name=Harper>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Hispanic&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary; Hispanic |first=Douglas |last=Harper |accessdate=10 February 2009}} Also: [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Spain&searchmode=none etymology of "Spain"], on the same site.</ref> or from [[Basque language|Basque]] ''Ezpanna''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anthon |first=Charles |title=A System of Ancient and Mediaeval Geography for the Use of Schools and Colleges |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1lDAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcoverdq=A+System+of+Ancient+and+Medi%C3%A6val+Geography+for+the+Use+of+Schools+and+Colleges |date=1850 |publisher=Harper |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> In English the word is attested from the 16th century (and in the late 19th century in American English).<ref>{{cite book|last=Herbst |first=Philip |title=The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UiZQH5gHuggC&pg=PA107&dq=latin+hispanicus&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ei=jx8pT6vaJsi_8gO-5bmnAw&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=latin%20hispanicus&f=false |date=1997 |publisher=Intercultural Press |isbn=978-1-877864-97-1 |page=107 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>

''Hispania'' was the Roman name for the whole territory of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Initially, this territory was divided into two provinces: [[Hispania Citerior]] and [[Hispania Ulterior]]. In 27 B.C, Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces, [[Hispania Baetica]] and [[Hispania Lusitania]], while Hispania Citerior was renamed [[Hispania Tarraconensis]]. This division of Hispania explains the usage of the singular and plural forms (Spain, and The Spains) used to refer to the peninsula and its kingdoms in the Middle Ages.<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Callaghan |first=Joseph F. |title=A History of Medieval Spain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yA3p6v3UxyIC&pg=PA24&dq=medieval+spain+was+a+geographic+location&hl=en&ei=MIe9TcmHDIOZ8QOLmY3cBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=31 August 1983 |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=0-8014-9264-5 |page=24 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>

Before the marriage of Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in 1469, the four Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula—the Kingdom of [[Portugal]], the [[Crown of Aragon]], the [[Crown of Castile]], and the [[Kingdom of Navarre]]—were collectively called The Spains. This revival of the old Roman concept in the [[Middle Ages]] appears to have originated in [[Provence|Provençal]], and was first documented at the end of the 11th century. In the [[Council of Constance]], the four kingdoms shared one vote.

The word ''[[Lusitanians|Lusitanian]]'', relates to Lusitania or Portugal, also in reference to the [[Lusitanians]], possibly one of the first [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] tribes to settle in Europe. From this tribe's name had derived the name of the [[Roman province]] of [[Lusitania]], and ''[[:la:Lusitania|Lusitania]]'' remains the name of Portugal in Latin.

The terms ''Spain'' and ''the Spains'' were not interchangeable.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rowe |first=Erin Kathleen |title=Saint and Nation: Santiago, Teresa of Avila, and Plural Identities in Early Modern Spain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDlqrxan22AC&pg=PA10&dq=the+spains+%22las+espanas%22&hl=en&ei=m1yYTeLxIMSp8AOB5MyzCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=the%20spains%20%22las%20espanas%22&f=false |accessdate=19 January 2016|date=1 January 2011 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |isbn=978-0-271-03773-8 |page=10}}</ref> Spain was a [[geographic region|geographic territory]], home to several kingdoms (Christian and Muslim), with separate governments, laws, languages, religions, and customs, and was the historical remnant of the Hispano-Gothic unity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ruiz |first=Teofilo F. |title=Spain's Centuries of Crisis: 1300 - 1474 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DteXifpgh_UC&pg=PA1&dq=the+spains&hl=en&ei=DTarTePwA4ip8APmpeC4Ag&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=the%20spains&f=false |accessdate=19 January 2016|date=15 April 2008 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-0-470-76644-6 |page=1 }}</ref> Spain was not a political entity until much later, and when referring to the Middle Ages, one should not be confounded with the nation-state of today.<ref>{{cite book|last=Baruque |first=Julio Valdeón |title=Las Raices Medievales de España |trans_title=The medieval roots of Spain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WoApUAccnoC&pg=PA55&dq=concepto+de+espana&hl=en&ei=nnmhTa7KKs288gPv3cWoAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=19 January 2016|date=2002 |publisher=Real Academia de la Historia |language=Spanish |isbn=978-84-95983-95-4 |page=55}}</ref> The term ''The Spains'' referred specifically to a collective of juridico-political units, first the Christian kingdoms, and then the different kingdoms ruled by the same king.

The expansion of the [[Spanish Empire]] between 1492 and 1898 brought thousands of Spanish migrants to the conquered lands, who established settlements, mainly in the Americas, but also in other distant parts of the world (as in the Philippines, the lone Spanish territory in Asia), producing a number of multiracial populations. Today, the term ''Hispanic'' is typically applied to the varied populations of these places, including those with little or no Spanish ancestry.

===Definitions in ancient Rome===<!--NEEDS WORK-->
The Latin gentile adjectives that belong to Hispania are ''Hispanus, Hispanicus,'' and ''Hispanienses.'' A Hispanus is someone who is a native of Hispania with no foreign parents, while children born in Hispania of (Latin) Roman parents were Hispaniensis. ''Hispaniensis'' means 'connected in some way to Hispania', as in "Exercitus Hispaniensis" ('the Spanish army') or "mercatores Hispanienses" ('Spanish merchants'). ''Hispanicus'' implies 'of' or 'belonging to' Hispania or the Hispanus or of their fashion as in "glaudius Hispanicus".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaFJAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA326&dq=hispanicus&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KrEuT8HnGcf-8QOXvbDnDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=hispanicus&f=false |accessdate=19 January 2016 |date=1820 |publisher=E.

===Definitions in Portugal and Spain===
The term Hispanic signifies the cultural resonance, among other elements and characteristics, of the descendants of the people who inhabited ancient Hispania (Iberian Peninsula). It has been used throughout history for many purposes, including drawing a contrast to the Moors and differentiating explorers and settlers.

Technically speaking, persons from Portugal or of Portuguese extraction are referred to as Lusitanians. In Portugal, Hispanic refers to something related to ancient Hispania, Spain or the Spanish language and culture, not Portugal.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/hisp%c3%a2nico |title=Significado / definição de hispânico |work=Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa |language=pt |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Portugal and Spain do not have exactly the same definition for the term Hispanic, but they do share the etymology for the word (pt: ''hispânico'', es: ''hispánico'').
[[The Royal Spanish Academy]] (Spanish: Real Academia Española, RAE), the official royal institution responsible for regulating the Spanish language defines the term "Hispano" (which means "Hispanic" in Spanish) as:<ref>{{cite web |url= http://buscon.rae.es/drae/?type=3&val=hispano |title=hispano-. |work=Diccionario de la lengua española |publisher=Real Academia Española |accessdate=19 January 2016 |language=Spanish}}</ref>
* Of or pertaining to Spain.
* Spanish, as applied to a person.
* Belonging or relative to old Hispania.
* Of or pertaining to the nations of [[Hispanic America]].
* Of or pertaining to the population of Hispanic American origin who live in the United States of America.
* A person of this origin who lives in the United States of America.

The correct modern term to identify Portuguese and Spanish cultures under a single nomenclature is "Iberian", and the one to refer to cultures derived from both countries in the Americas is "Iberian-American". These designations can be mutually recognized by people in Portugal and Brazil, unlike "Hispanic", which is totally void of any self-identification in those countries, and quite on the opposite, serves the purpose of marking a clear distinction in relation to neighboring countries´ culture.

In Spanish, the term "hispano" as in "hispanoamericano", refers to the people of Spanish origin who live in the Americas; it also refers to a relationship to Hispania or to the Spanish language. There are people in Hispanic America that are not of Spanish origin, as the original people of these areas are Amerindians.

The term "Hispanic" was first used in the United States to define the growing number of the American population with Spanish ancestry. The term does not include immigrants from Spanish speaking countries however.

Today, organizations in the [[United States]] use the term as a broad catchall to refer to persons with a historical and cultural relationship with Spain, regardless of race and ethnicity.<ref name="fhwa.dot.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/hep/guidance/superseded/49cfr26.cfm |title=Archived: 49 CFR Part 26 |work=U.S. Department of Transportation |accessdate=19 January 2016 |quote="'Hispanic Americans,' which includes persons of Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Dominican, Central or South American, or other Spanish culture or origin, regardless of race..."}}</ref><ref name="SBA 8005">{{cite web |url=https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/SOP_80_05_3A.pdf |title=SOP 80 05 3A: Overview of the 8(A) Business Development Program |work=U.S. Small Business Administration |date=11 April 2008 |accessdate=19 January 2016 |quote="SBA has defined 'Hispanic American' as an individual whose ancestry and culture are rooted in South America, Central America, Mexico, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, or Spain."}}</ref> The U.S. Census Bureau defines the [[ethnonym]] ''[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]]'' to refer to "a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race"<ref name="census.gov">{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-04.pdf |title=The Hispanic Population: 2010 |date=May 2011 |work=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> and states that Hispanics or Latinos can be of any race, any ancestry, any ethnicity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewhispanic.org/2009/05/28/whos-hispanic/ |title=Who’s Hispanic? |first1=Jeffrey S. |last1=Passel |first2=Paul |last2=Taylor |work=Pew Research Center |date=28 May 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Generically, this limits the definition of Hispanic or Latino to people from the Caribbean, Central and South America, or other Hispanic (Spanish or Portuguese) culture or origin, regardless of race. Latino can refer to males or females, while Latina refers to only females.

Because of the technical distinctions involved in defining "race" vs. "ethnicity," there is confusion among the general population about the designation of Hispanic identity. Currently, the United States Census Bureau defines six race categories:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf |title=Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin |work=U.S. Census Bureau |date=March 2011 |first1=Karen R. |last1=Humes |first2=Nicholas A. |last2=Jones |first3=Roberto R. |last3=Ramirez |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>
* White or Caucasian
* Black or African American
* American Indian or Alaska Native
* Asian
* Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
* Some Other Racists (Trumps) 

According to census reports, of the above races the largest number of Hispanic or Latinos are of the White race, the second largest number come from the Native American/American Indian race who are the indigenous people of the Americas. The inhabitants of Easter Island are Pacific Islanders and since the island belongs to Chile they are theoretically Hispanic or Latinos.
Because Hispanic roots are considered aligned with a European ancestry (Spain/Portugal), Hispanic/Latino ancestry is defined solely as an ''ethnic ''designation (similar to being Norse or Germanic). Therefore, a person of Hispanic descent is typically defined using both race and ethnicity as an identifier—i.e., Black-Hispanic, White-Hispanic, Asian-Hispanic, Amerindian-Hispanic or "other race" Hispanic.

Officially, however, the U.S. Government has defined ''Hispanic or Latino'' persons as being "persons who trace their origin or descent to Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central and South America, and other Spanish cultures". This includes Spain and Portugal which is the origin of Hispanic/Iberian culture.<ref name=omb>{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity |work=The White House Office of Management and Budget |date=30 October 1997 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> The [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|United States Census]] uses the [[ethnonym]] ''[[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]]'' to refer to "a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Hispanic culture or origin regardless of race."<ref name="census.gov"/>

In a recent study, most Spanish-speakers of Spanish or Hispanic American descent do not prefer the term "Hispanic" or "Latino" when it comes to describing their identity. Instead, they prefer to be identified by their country of origin. When asked if they have a preference for either being identified as "Hispanic" or "Latino," the Pew study finds that "half (51%) say they have no preference for either term."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/04/04/study-most-hispanics-prefer-describing-identity-from-familys-country-of-origin/ |title=Study: Most Hispanics Prefer Describing Identity From Family’s Country Of Origin |work=CBS DC |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> A majority (51%) say they most often identify themselves by their family’s country of origin, while 24% say they prefer a pan-ethnic label such as Hispanic or Latino.

====Hispanicization====
Hispanicization is the process by which a place or a person absorbs characteristics of Hispanic society and culture.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hispanic Spaces, Latino Places: Community and Cultural Diversity in Contemporary America |year=2004 |editor-first=Dan |editor-last=Arreola |chapter=14.

Hispanization of a person might be illustrated by speaking Spanish, making and eating Hispanic American food, listening to Spanish language music or participating in Hispanic festivals and holidays - Hispanization of those outside the Hispanic community as opposed to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of Hispanics into theirs.

One reason that some people believe the assimilation of Hispanics in the U.S. is not comparable to that of other cultural groups is that [[Hispanic and Latino Americans]] have been living in parts of North America for centuries, in many cases well before the English-speaking culture became dominant. For example, [[California]], [[Texas]], [[Colorado]], [[New Mexico]] (1598), [[Arizona]], [[Nevada]], [[Florida]] and [[Puerto Rico]] have been home to Spanish-speaking peoples since the 16th century, long before the U.S. existed. (But it should be noted that the language of the Native Americans existed before this, until the invasion and forced assimilation by the Spanish.) These and other Spanish-speaking territories were part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], and later [[Mexico]] (with the exception of Florida and Puerto Rico), before these regions joined or were taken over by the United States in 1848. Some cities in the U.S. were founded by Spanish settlers as early as the 16th century, prior to the creation of the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. For example, San Miguel de Gualdape, [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]] and [[St. Augustine, Florida]] were founded in 1526, 1559 and 1565 respectively. [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] was founded in 1604, and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] was established in 1660. [[El Paso]] was founded in 1659, [[San Antonio]] in 1691, [[Laredo, Texas]] in 1755, [[San Diego]] in 1769, [[San Francisco]] in 1776, [[San Jose, California]] in 1777, [[New Iberia, Louisiana]] in 1779, and [[Los Angeles]] in 1781. Therefore, in many parts of the U.S., the Hispanic cultural legacy predates English/British influence. For this reason, many generations have largely maintained their cultural traditions and [[Spanish language]] well before the United States was created. However, Spanish-speaking persons in many Hispanic areas in the U.S. amounted to only a few thousand people when they became part of the United States; a large majority of current Hispanic residents are descended from Hispanics who entered the United States in the mid-to-late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Language retention is a common index to assimilation; according to the 2000 census, about 75 percent of all Hispanics spoke Spanish in the home. Spanish language retention rates vary geographically; parts of Texas and New Mexico have language retention rates over 90 percent, whereas in parts of Colorado and California, retention rates are lower than 30 percent. The degree of retention of Spanish as the native language is based on recent arrival from countries where Spanish is spoken. As is true of other immigrants, those who were born in other countries still speak their native language. Later generations are increasingly less likely to speak the language spoken in the country of their ancestors, as is true of other immigrant groups.

Today, Spanish is among the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most commonly spoken first languages]] of the world. During the period of the [[Spanish Empire]] from 1492 and 1898, many people migrated from Spain to the conquered lands. The [[Spaniard]]s brought with them the Castilian language and culture, and in this [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|process that lasted several centuries]], created a [[global empire]] with a diverse population.

[[Miscegenation]] between peoples in the colonies led to the creation of the new mixed peoples, chiefly [[mestizo|half-caste]] and [[mulatto]]s, in many countries.

Culturally, Spaniards are typically European, but they also have small traces of many peoples from the rest of Europe, the Near East and the Mediterranean areas of northern Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/7/1361.full |title=Estimating the Impact of Prehistoric Admixture on the Genome of Europeans |first1=Isabelle |last1=Dupanloup |first2=Giorgio |last2=Bertorelle |first3=Lounès |last3=Chikhi |first4=Guido |last4=Barbujani |journal=[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]] |date=24 March 2004 |volume=21 |issue=7 |pages=1361–1372 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msh135 |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mcdonald/WorldHaplogroupsMaps.pdf |title=Y Haplogroups of the World |year=2005 |first=J.

The Hispanic countries, including Spain, are also inhabited by peoples of non-Spanish ancestry, to widely varying extents.

==Culture==

The [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] is awarded to Hispanic writers, whereas the [[Latin Grammy Award]] recognizes Hispanic and Portuguese musicians, and the Platino Awards as given to outstanding Hispanic films.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Spain|Hispanic music|Latin music (genre)}}

Folk and popular dance and music also varies greatly among Hispanics. For instance, the music from Spain is a lot different from the [[Hispanic America]]n, although there is a high grade of exchange between both continents. In addition, due to the high national development of the diverse [[nationalities and regions of Spain]], there is a lot of music in the [[Languages of Spain|different languages of the Peninsula]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]] and [[Basque language|Basque]], mainly). See, for instance, [[Music of Catalonia]] or [[Rock català]], [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias]], and [[Basque music]]. [[Flamenco]] is also a very popular music style in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]]. Spanish ballads "romances" can be traced in Mexico as "corridos" or in Argentina as "milongas", same structure but different scenarios.

On the other side of the ocean, Hispanic America is also home to a wide variety of music, even though "Latin" music is often erroneously thought of, as a single genre. Hispanic Caribbean music tends to favor complex polyrhythms of African origin. [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]] shows combined influences of mostly Spanish and Native American origin, while traditional Northern Mexican music &mdash; [[norteño (music)|norteño]] and [[banda music|banda]] &mdash; is more influenced by country-and-western music and the [[polka]], brought by [[Central Europe]]an settlers to [[Mexico]]. The music of Hispanic Americans &mdash; such as [[tejano music]] &mdash; has influences in [[Rock music|rock]], [[jazz]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Latin pop|pop]], and [[country music]] as well as traditional Mexican music such as [[Mariachi]]. Meanwhile, native [[Andes|Andean]] sounds and melodies are the backbone of Peruvian and Bolivian music, but also play a significant role in the popular music of most South American countries and are heavily incorporated into the folk music of Ecuador and Chile and the tunes of Colombia, and again in Chile where they play a fundamental role in the form of the greatly followed [[nueva canción]]. In U.S. communities of immigrants from these countries it is common to hear these styles. [[Latin pop]], [[Rock en Español]], [[Hip-hop|Latin hip-hop]], [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], [[Merengue (dance)|Merengue]], [[colombian cumbia]] and [[Reggaeton]] styles tend to appeal to the broader Hispanic population, and varieties of Cuban music are popular with many Hispanics of all backgrounds.

===Literature===
{{Main|Hispanic literature}}

[[File:Medal of the Miguel de Cervantes Prize.svg|thumb|180px|[[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]], most prestigious literary award in the Spanish language]]

Spanish-language literature and folklore is very rich and is influenced by a variety of countries. There are thousands of writers from many places, and dating from the Middle Ages to the present. Some of the most recognized writers are [[Miguel de Cervantes|Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra]] (Spain), [[Lope de Vega]] (Spain), [[Calderón de la Barca]] (Spain), [[Jose Rizal]] (Philippines), [[Carlos Fuentes]] (Mexico), [[Octavio Paz]] (Mexico), [[Miguel Ángel Asturias]] (Guatemala), [[George Santayana]] (US), [[José Martí]] (Cuba), [[Sabine Ulibarri]] (US), [[Federico García Lorca]] (Spain), [[Miguel de Unamuno]] (Spain), [[Gabriel García Márquez]] (Colombia), [[Rafael Pombo]] (Colombia), [[Horacio Quiroga]] (Uruguay), [[Rómulo Gallegos]] (Venezuela), [[Luis Rodriguez Varela]] (Philippines), [[Rubén Darío]] (Nicaragua), [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (Peru), [[Giannina Braschi]] (Puerto Rico), [[Cristina Peri Rossi]] (Uruguay), [[Luisa Valenzuela]] (Argentina), [[Roberto Quesada]] (Honduras), [[Julio Cortázar]] (Argentina), [[Pablo Neruda]] (Chile), [[Gabriela Mistral]] (Chile), [[Jorge Luis Borges]] (Argentina), [[Pedro Henríquez Ureña]] (Dominican Republic), [[Ernesto Sabato]] (Argentina), [[Juan Tomás Ávila Laurel]] (Equatorial Guinea), [[Ciro Alegría]] (Peru), [[Joaquin Garcia Monge]] (Costa Rica), and [[Jesus Balmori]] (Philippines).

===Sports===
In the majority of the Hispanic countries, [[association football]] is the most popular sport. The men's national teams of Argentine, Uruguay and Spain have won the [[FIFA World Cup]] a total five times. The Spanish [[La Liga]] is one of the most popular in the world, known for [[FC Barcelona]] and [[Real Madrid]]. Meanwhile, the [[Argentine Primera División]] and [[Mexican Primera División]] are two of the strongest leagues in the Americas.

However, [[baseball]] is the most popular sport in some Central American and Caribbean countries (especially Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Venezuela), as well as in the diaspora in the United States. Notable Hispanic teams in early baseball are the [[All Cubans]], [[Cuban Stars]] and [[New York Cubans]]. The [[Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum]] recognizes Hispanic baseball personalities. Nearly 30 percent (22 percent foreign-born Latinos) of [[MLB]] players today have Hispanic heritage.

Several Hispanic sportspeople have been successful worldwide, such as [[Diego Maradona]], [[Alfredo di Stefano]], [[Lionel Messi]], [[Diego Forlán]] (association football), [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], [[Eliseo Salazar]], [[Fernando Alonso]], [[Marc Gené]], [[Carlos Sainz]] (auto racing), [[Ángel Nieto]], [[Dani Pedrosa]], [[Jorge Lorenzo]], [[Marc Márquez]], [[Marc Coma]], [[Nani Roma]] (motorcycle racing), [[Emanuel Ginóbili]], [[Pau Gasol]], [[Marc Gasol]] (basketball), [[Julio César Chávez]], [[Saúl Álvarez]], [[Carlos Monzón]] (boxing), [[Miguel Indurain]], [[Alberto Contador]], [[Santiago Botero]], [[Rigoberto Urán]], [[Nairo Quintana]] (cycling), [[Roberto de Vicenzo]], [[Ángel Cabrera]], [[Sergio García]], [[Severiano Ballesteros]], [[José María Olazábal]] (golf), [[Luciana Aymar]] (field hockey), [[Rafael Nadal]], [[Marcelo Ríos]], [[Guillermo Vilas]], [[Gabriela Sabatini]], [[Juan Martín del Potro]] (tennis).

Notable Hispanic sports television networks are [[ESPN Latin America]], [[Fox Sports Latin America]] and [[TyC Sports]].

===Religion===
With regard to religious affiliation among Spanish-speakers, [[Christianity]] &mdash; specifically [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] &mdash; is usually the first religious tradition that comes to mind {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. The Spaniards and the Portuguese took the Roman Catholic faith to Ibero-America and the Philippines, and Roman Catholicism remains the predominant religion amongst most Hispanics. A small but growing number of Hispanics belong to a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denomination.
{{Undue weight|date=December 2009}}
There are also Spanish-speaking [[Jew]]s, most of whom are the descendants of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] who migrated from Europe (German Jews, Russian Jews, Polish Jews, etc.) to Hispanic America, particularly [[Argentina]], [[Uruguay]], [[Peru]] and [[Cuba]] (Argentina is host to the third largest Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere, after the United States and Canada)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jppi.org.il/uploads/JPPI_2014-2015_Annual_Assessment-English.pdf |title=Annual Assessment: The Situation and Dynamics of the Jewish People |year=2015 |page=18 |work=The Jewish People Policy Planning Institute |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ujc.org/section.html?id=29 |title=Global Jewish Populations |work=United Jewish Federations}}</ref> in the 19th century and following World War II. Many Spanish-speaking Jews also originate from the small communities of reconverted descendants of [[anusim]] &mdash; those whose Spanish [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi Jewish]] ancestors long ago hid their Jewish ancestry and beliefs in fear of persecution by the [[Spanish Inquisition]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and Ibero-America. The Spanish Inquisition led to a large number of forced conversions of Spanish Jews.

Genetic studies on the (male) [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] conducted by the [[University of Leeds]] in 2008 appear to support the idea that the number of forced conversions have been previously underestimated significantly. They found that twenty percent of Spanish males have Y-chromosomes associated with Sephardic Jewish ancestry.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |title=Gene Test Shows Spain's Jewish and Muslim Mix |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 December 2008 |page=A12 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/science/05genes.html |subscription=yes}}</ref> This may imply that there were more forced conversions than was previously thought.

There are also thought to be many Catholic-professing descendants of [[marrano]]s and Spanish-speaking [[Crypto-Judaism|crypto-Jews]] in the [[Southwestern United States]] and scattered through Hispanic America. Additionally, there are Sephardic Jews who are descendants of those Jews who fled Spain to Turkey, [[Syria]], and North Africa, some of whom have now migrated to Hispanic America, holding on to some Spanish/Sephardic customs, such as the [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language, which mixes Spanish, Hebrew, Arabic and others, though written with Hebrew and Latin characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Ladino |title=Ladino |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> Though, it should be noted, that [[Slavery|Ladinos]] were also African slaves captive in Spain held prior to the colonial period in the Americas. (See also [[History of the Jews in Latin America|History of the Jews in Hispanic America]] and [[List of Latin American Jews|List of Hispanic American Jews]].)

Among the Spanish-speaking Catholics, most communities celebrate their homeland's [[patron saint]], dedicating a day for this purpose with festivals and religious services. Some Spanish-speakers syncretize Roman Catholicism and African or Native American rituals and beliefs. Such is the case of [[Santería]], popular with [[Afro-Cuban]]s, which combines old African beliefs in the form of Roman Catholic saints and rituals. Other syncretistic beliefs include [[Spiritism]] and [[Curandero|Curanderismo]].

While a tiny minority, there are some Muslims in Latin America, in the US, and in the Philippines. Those in the Philippines live predominantly in the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] province.

In the United States, some 65% of Hispanics and Latinos report themselves Catholic and 21% Protestant, with 13% having no affiliation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/pdf/religion_hispanic_churches.pdf |title=Hispanic Churches in American Public Life: Summary of Findings |accessdate=27 December 2006 |date=January 2003 |last1=Espinosa |first1=Gastón |last2=Elizondo |first2=Virgilio |last3=Miranda |first3=Jesse |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101044854/http://www.pewtrusts.org/pdf/religion_hispanic_churches.pdf |archivedate=1 November 2006}}</ref> A minority among the Roman Catholics, about one in five, are [[charismatic Christianity|charismatics]]. Among the Protestant, 85% are "[[Born again (Christianity)|Born-again Christians]]" and belong to [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] or [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] churches. Among the smallest groups, less than 4%, are Jewish.

== Cultural heritage according to UNESCO ==

The Hispanic world, according to the United Nations World Heritage Committee, has contributed substantially more than any other ethnicity to the cultural heritage of the world. A World Heritage Cultural Site is a place such as a building, city, complex, or monument that is listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as being of special cultural significance. Of a total of 802 Cultural World Heritage Sites recognized by the United Nations as of July 2015, 114 are located in Hispanic countries. Spain alone has 39 cultural sites, only second in the world to Italy.
