==History==
[[File:TownplotpfAkron.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Original town plot of Akron]]
In 1811, Paul Williams settled near the corner of what is now Buchtel Avenue and Broadway and suggested to surveyor of the [[Connecticut Land Company]]'s [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] General [[Simon Perkins]], the co-founding of a town at the summit of the developing [[Ohio and Erie Canal]]. The name derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|ἄκρον}} signifying a summit or high point.<ref>{{LSJ|a)/kron|ἄκρον|ref}}.</ref> Laid out in December 1825, where the South part of the Downtown, Akron neighborhood now is; Irish laborers working on the [[Ohio Canal]] built approximately 100 cabins nearby in autumn.

Because of Eliakim Crosby founding "North Akron" (Cascade) in 1833, "South" was added to Akron's name up until the two merged and became an incorporated village in 1836.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In 1840 [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit County]] formed from portions of [[Portage County, Ohio|Portage]], [[Medina County, Ohio|Medina]], and [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark]] counties. Akron replaced [[Cuyahoga Falls]] as its county seat a year later and opened a canal connecting to [[Beaver, Pennsylvania]], helping give birth to the [[stoneware]], [[Sanitary sewer|sewer pipe]], [[fishing tackle]], and [[farming|farming equipment]] industries.<ref name="akronhistory.org"/><ref name="ReferenceB"/> In 1844, abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] moved into the [[John Brown House (Akron, Ohio)|John Brown House]] across the street from business partner [[Colonel Simon Perkins]] who lived in the [[Perkins Stone Mansion]]. The Akron School Law of 1847 began the [[K-12 (education)|K-12 grade school system]], which currently is used in every U.S. state.<ref name="ohiohistorycentral.org"/>

When the Ohio Women's Rights Convention came to Akron in 1851, [[Sojourner Truth]] extemporaneously delivered her speech named ''[[Ain't I A Woman?]]'', at the Universalist Old Stone Church. Associated with the church, [[John R. Buchtel]] founded Buchtel College in 1870, renamed the [[University of Akron]] in 1913. Purchasing a mill in 1856, [[Ferdinand Schumacher]] mass-produced [[oat|oat bars]] which the [[Union Army]] were supplied with during the [[American Civil War]], becoming high in demand afterward.

Other popular inventions include rubber balloons; ducks; dolls; balls, Baby Buggy Bumpers, and Little Brown Jugs. In 1895, the first long distance electric railway, the [[Akron, Bedford and Cleveland Railroad]], began service.<ref>http://omp.ohiolink.edu/OMP/NewDetails?oid=955184&scrapid=566&format=yourscrap&sort=title&searchstatus=0&count=1&hits=1</ref> On August 25, 1889, the [[Boston Daily Globe]] referred to Akron with the nickname "Summit City".<ref name="PopikSmoky"/> To assist local police, the city deployed the first police car in the U.S. running on electricity.<ref name="Police Technology"/>

Rubber companies responded to housing crunches by building affordable housing for workers.

===2000s: City of Invention===
[[File:AkronUniverstyBucthel.JPG|thumb|left|The UofA displays the [[Archives of the History of American Psychology]]]]
Despite the number of rubber workers decreasing by approximately half from 2000–07, Akron's research in [[polymers]] gained an international reputation.<ref name="Akron, Ohio"/> It now centers the [[Polymer Valley]] which consist of 400 polymer-related companies, of which 94 were located in the city itself.<ref name="newsweek.com"/> Research is focused at the [[University of Akron]] which is home to the [[Goodyear Polymer Center]] and [[National Polymer Innovation Center]], and first College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering.

The city also continues to deal with the effects of air and soil pollution from its industrial past. In the southwestern part of the city, soil was contaminated and noxious [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]-laden fumes were put into the air by an electrical transformer deconstruction operation that existed from the 1930s to the 1960s. Cleanup of the site, designated as a [[Superfund]] site by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]], began in 1987 and concluded in 2000.

As a result of multiple towns merging, and industry boom, Akron's architecture is diverse.

Originally a canal town, the city is divided into two parts by the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]], with downtown being centered on it. Along the locks, the city has a path paved with rubber.

Akron was awarded with the [[World's most livable cities|City Livability Award]] in 2008 for its efforts to co-purpose new school buildings as community learning centers. In 2009, the [[National Arbor Day Foundation]] designated Akron as a [[Tree City USA]] for the 14th time.<ref name="Ci.akron.oh.us"/>

Many of the city's government and civic buildings, including City Hall, the [[Summit County Courthouse (Ohio)|Summit County Courthouse]], the [[Akron-Summit County Public Library]], and [[John S. Knight Center]] are fairly old.

The First Methodist Episcopal Church first used the [[Akron Plan]] in 1872, the plan later gained popularity, being used in many [[Congregationalists]], [[Baptists]], and [[Presbyterians]].<ref name="nrhpinv_ny"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=eYNjS56yx-0C&pg=PA269&dq=John+Fletcher+Hurst+- ''When Church Became Theatre: The Transformation of Evangelical Architecture and Worship in Nineteenth-Century America'']. Jeanne Halgren Kilde. [[Oxford University Press]], 2005. ISBN 0-19-517972-2.`p.185</ref>

The city is home to a historic 1920s atmospheric [[movie palace]], the [[Akron Civic Theatre]].  One of the building's features is a starry sky with clouds that drift over it when the lights are dimmed.

Completed in 1931, Akron's tallest building, the [[FirstMerit Tower]], features the [[art deco]] style and is covered in [[glazed architectural terra-cotta]].<ref name="FirstMerit Restoration">FirstMerit Restoration, http://www.westerngroup.com/servicesAndProjects/structures/officeCommercial.jspx?fileName=1120493926173-106-04-01.jpg&id=245</ref> Standing {{convert|330|ft|m}}, it is built on top of the Hamilton Building, completed in 1900 in the [[neo-gothic]] style.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Near the turn of the millennium the tower was given a $2.5 million facelift, including a $1.8 million restoration of the tower's terra-cotta, brick and limestone.<ref name="FirstMerit Restoration"/> The top of the building has a television broadcast tower, formerly used by WAKR-TV (now [[WVPX-TV]]) and [[WAKR-AM]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Scraping the Sky|work=[[Beacon Journal]]|publisher=[[Knight-Ridder]]|page=Beacon Magazine 13|date=March 14, 1999}}</ref> The antenna reaches {{convert|134.7|m|ft}}.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}Located on the [[University of Akron]] campus, the [[Goodyear Polymer Center]], is glass twin towers connected by walkways.

The [[Akron Art Museum]] commissioned [[Coop Himmelblau]] to design an expansion in 2007.  The new building connects to the old building and is divided into three parts known as the "Crystal",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akronartmuseum.org/photos/details.php?catid=40&unid=511 |title=Akron Art Museum – Building the Akron Art Museum |publisher=Akronartmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> "Gallery Box",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akronartmuseum.org/photos/details.php?catid=40&unid=502 |title=Akron Art Museum – Building the Akron Art Museum |publisher=Akronartmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref> and the "Roof Cloud".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akronartmuseum.org/photos/details.php?catid=40&unid=526 |title=Akron Art Museum – Building the Akron Art Museum |publisher=Akronartmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>

====Neighborhoods====
{{Main|Akron neighborhoods}}
Akron consists of 21 neighborhoods, with an additional three that are unincorporated but recognized within the city. The neighborhoods of the city differ in design largely because of expansions such as town merging, annexation, housing construction in various time periods, and rubber era.

Maple Valley covers the west end of Copley Road, before reaching I-77. Along this strip are several businesses using the name, as well as the Maple Valley Branch of the [[Akron-Summit County Public Library]]. Spicertown falls under the blanket of University Park, this term is used frequently to describe the student-centered retail and residential area around East Exchange and Spicer streets, near the University of Akron. West Hill is roughly bounded by West Market Street on the north, West Exchange Street on the south, Downtown on the East, and Rhodes Avenue on the west. It features many stately older homes, particularly in the recently recognized Oakdale Historic District.

==Education==

[[File:Goodyear Polymer Center.jpg|thumb|left|Goodyear Polymer Center]]
Preschool, elementary, and secondary education is mainly provided by the [[Akron Public Schools|Akron City School District]]. Planning of the district began in 1840, when Ansel Miller suggested to build free public schools for all children in the city, paid for by property taxes. After enduring much opposition by citizens, in 1843 Miller joined with Rev. Isaac Jennings. Three years later, Jennings became the chairman of a committee of citizens who discussed how to improve the school system. On November 21, 1846, their plan was approved unanimously by the citizens. The Ohio Legislature adopted the plan, called "An act for the support and better regulation of the Common Schools of the Town of Akron" on February 8, 1847. Akron's first public schools were established in the fall of 1847 and were led by Mortimer Leggett. The first annual report showed that it cost less than $2 a year to educate a child. In 1857 the cost of running the schools for a year was $4,200. The primary schools were taught by young women, which the Akron Board of Education justified because they could be paid less and were under the supervision of a male superintendent. From 1877 to 1952, Akron graduated students semi-annually instead of annually. 9% of the city's school-aged population were born in other countries in 1888. In the 1920s, an Americanization program was designed to help the many Akron students who were first-generation Americans. Classes were in the rubber companies and some of the schools. A "continuation school" began for working boys and girls who were required by law to have at least four hours of schooling a week. In 1924, Akron's platoon schools attracted visitors from all over the country. Being a stronghold for the [[Ku Klux Klan]] during the decade, the majority of school board and government officials were members. Their influence ended with the arrival of [[Wendell Willkie]]. During the city's 1950s boom town phase, Akron schools grew eight times faster than the city's population. In 1967, Kenmore launched the Air Force JROTC. In 1971, Jennings piloted the middle school model, which moved ninth-graders to the senior high school. In 1984, all-day kindergarten was piloted at Seiberling, Rankin and Hatton schools, and Ellet, East and Garfield high schools piloted the in-school suspension program. The district received an A+ evaluation from the state in 1987.<ref name="akronschools.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.akronschools.com/dotAsset/13842.pdf |title=History of the Akron Public Schools |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2012}}</ref>

==Transportation==

===Airports===
[[File:Akron-Fulton Terminal.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Akron Fulton International Airport administration building]]
The primary terminal that airline passengers traveling to or from Akron use is the [[Akron-Canton Regional Airport]], serving nearly 2 million passengers a year. The Akron-Canton Airport is a commercial [[airspace class|Class C]] airport located in the city of [[Green, Ohio|Green]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.akroncantonairport.com/uploads/CAK_WelcomePage_FINAL.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209090219/http://www.akroncantonairport.com/uploads/CAK_WelcomePage_FINAL.pdf |title=Welcome to the Akron-Canton Airport!}}</ref> roughly {{convert|10|mi|0|abbr=on}} southeast of Akron operated jointly by [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark]] and [[Summit County, Ohio|Summit]] counties.  It serves as an alternative for travelers to or from the Cleveland area as well. [[Akron Fulton International Airport]] is a [[general aviation]] airport located in and owned by the City of Akron that serves private planes.  It first opened in 1929 and has operated in several different capacities since then. The airport had commercial scheduled airline service until the 1950s and it is now used for both cargo and private planes.<ref name="Akron, Ohio: Akron Fulton Airport"/>
It is home of the [[Goodyear Airdock|Lockheed Martin Airdock]], where the Goodyear airships, dirigibles, and blimps were originally stored and maintained. The Goodyear blimps are now housed outside of Akron in a facility on the shores of Wingfoot Lake in nearby [[Suffield Township, Portage County, Ohio|Suffield Township]].

===Railroads===
[[File:AkronNorthSideStation.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Akron Northside Station]]
Akron Northside Station is a train station at 27 Ridge Street along the [[Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad]].<ref name="Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, Akron Northside Station In Akron, Ohio - Ohio.com"/>

Because of the city's large rubber industry, Akron was once serviced by a variety of railroads who competed for the city's freight and passenger business. The largest of these railroads were the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], [[Erie Railroad]], and the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. Smaller regional railroads included the [[Akron Canton and Youngstown Railroad]], [[Northern Ohio Railroad]], and the [[Akron Barberton Belt Railroad]].<ref>{{Sanders-Akron}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} Today the city is only serviced by [[CSX Corporation]] which has a de facto monopoly on all rail freight transport to and from the city. There is currently no passenger rail transportation.

===Bus and public transportation===
[[File:AkronIntermodalTransitCenter.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Intermodal Transit Center]]
Public transportation is available through the [[METRO Regional Transit Authority]] system, which has a fleet of over two hundred buses and trolleys and operates local routes as well as running commuter buses into downtown Cleveland. [[Stark Area Regional Transit Authority]] (SARTA) also has a bus line running between [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] and Akron and the [[Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority]] (PARTA) runs an express route connecting the [[University of Akron]] with [[Kent State University]].<ref name="Akron Express"/>
Metro RTA operates out of the Intermodal Transit Center on South Broadway Street. This facility, which opened in 2009, also houses inter-city bus transportation available through [[Greyhound Lines]].<ref name="Solar panels make Akron's new transit center a leader in Ohio"/>

===Freeways===
Akron is served by two major interstate highways that bisect the city. Unlike other cities, the bisection does not occur in the Central Business District, nor do the interstates serve downtown; rather, the [[Ohio State Route 59|Akron Innerbelt]] and to a lesser extent [[Ohio State Route 8]] serve these functions.
[[File:akron innerbelt.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The Innerbelt looking northeast]]
* [[Interstate 77]] connects [[Marietta, Ohio]] to [[Cleveland]], Ohio. In Akron, it features 15 interchanges, four of which permit freeway-to-freeway movements. It runs north-south in the southern part of the city to its intersection with [[Interstate 76 (east)|I-76]], where it takes a westerly turn as a concurrency with Interstate 76.
* [[Interstate 76 (east)|Interstate 76]] connects [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]] to [[Youngstown, Ohio]] and farther environs. It runs east-west and has 18 interchanges in Akron, four of which are freeway-to-freeway. The East Leg was rebuilt in the 1990s to feature six lanes and longer merge lanes. The concurrency with Interstate 77 is eight lanes. The Kenmore Leg is a four-lane leg that is slightly less than two miles (3&nbsp;km) long and connects to Interstate 277.
* [[Interstate 277 (Ohio)|Interstate 277]] is an east-west spur that it forms with [[U.S. Highway 224|US 224]] after I-76 splits to the north to form the Kenmore Leg. It is six lanes and cosigned with U.S. 224.
[[File:AkronSkyline.jpg|right|300px|thumb|View of Akron from the south looking north]]
* The [[Ohio State Route 59|Akron Innerbelt]] is a six-lane, {{convert|2.24|mi|km|adj=on}} spur from the I-76/I-77 concurrency and serves the urban core of the city. Its ramps are directional from the interstates, so it only serves west side drivers. ODOT is considering changing this design to attract more traffic to the route. The freeway comes to an abrupt end near the northern boundary of downtown where it becomes Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. The freeway itself is officially known as "The Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Freeway". The freeway was originally designed to connect directly to State Route 8, but plans were laid to rest in the mid-1970s because of financial troubles.
* [[Ohio State Route 8]] is an original state highway that is a limited access route that connects Akron's northern suburbs with Interstates 76 and 77. State Route 8's southern terminus is at the central interchange, where it meets I-76 and I-77. The second freeway in Akron to be completed, it went through a major overhaul in 2003 with new ramps and access roads. In 2007 ODOT began a project to upgrade the road to interstate highway standards north of Akron from [[Ohio State Route 303|State Route 303]] to I-271, providing a high speed alternative to Cleveland.<ref name="Akron Innerbelt Integration Initiative - History"/>
