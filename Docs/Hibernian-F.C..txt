'''Hibernian Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɨ|ˈ|b|ɜr|n|i|ə|n}}), commonly known as '''Hibs''', are a Scottish professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Leith]] in the north of [[Edinburgh]].

===Foundation and early history (1875–1939)===
[[File:Cowgate, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Cowgate]], where Hibs were formed in 1875.]]

The club was founded in 1875 by Irishmen from the [[Cowgate]] area of [[Edinburgh]]. The name is derived from [[Hibernia]], the Roman name for Ireland.<ref name ="Origins"/> [[James Connolly]], the famous [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republican]] leader, was a Hibs fan,<ref name = "grass roots"/><ref>{{Cite news|last=Vallely |first=Joanna |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/hibernianfc/God-squad-signs-up-to.2798179.jp |title=God squad signs up to play host to Hibs past |work=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=Johnston Press |date=4 August 2006 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> while the club were "closely identified" with the [[Irish Home Rule Movement]] during the 1880s.<ref name = "crampsey"/> There was some [[sectarian]] resistance initially to an Irish club participating in [[Football in Scotland|Scottish football]], but Hibs established themselves as a force in Scottish football in the 1880s.<ref name ="Origins"/><ref name = "crampsey">{{harvnb|Crampsey|1990|p=27}}</ref><ref name = "grass roots"/> Hibs were the first club from the east coast of Scotland to win a major trophy, the [[1886–87 Scottish Cup|1887 Scottish Cup]]. They went on to defeat [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], who had won the [[FA Cup 1886–87|1887 FA Cup]], in a [[friendly match]] described as the ''Association Football Championship of the World Decider''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqnq0hIia0cC&pg=PA145&dq=hibernian+easter+road&hl=en&ei=yvRqTIvRB9W6jAfJ7rxx&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwATg8#v=onepage&q=hibernian%20easter%20road&f=false |quote=In August 1887, [[Scottish Cup]] holders Hibernian took on [[FA Cup]] winners [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in a [[friendly match|friendly]] at Hibs' [[Hibernian Park|Easter Road]] ground. Posters appeared all over [[Edinburgh]] billing the encounter as 'The Association Football Championship of the World'. Hibernian won the match 2–1 and therefore had the right (whichever way you look at it, as nobody else had bothered to stage such an event) to call themselves the first world champions, beating [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] to it by 43 years. |title=Day of the Match: A History of Football in 365 Days |author= Scott Murray and Rowan Walker |year=2008 |accessdate=17 August 2010 |ISBN=978-0-7522-2678-1 |publisher=Boxtree}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Mackay|1986|p=40}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lugton|1999|p=121}}</ref>

Mismanagement over the next few years led to Hibs becoming homeless and the club temporarily ceased operating in 1891.<ref name = "crampsey"/> A lease on the [[Easter Road]] site was acquired in late 1892 and Hibs played its first match at Easter Road on 4 February 1893.<ref name ="New Beginnings">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/page/TimelineDetail/0,,10290~1750639,00.html |title=The Origins of Hibernian – Part 12 |publisher=Hibernian F.C. |work=Hibernianfc.co.uk |date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> Despite this interruption, the club today views the period since 1875 as one continued history and therefore counts the honours won between 1875 and 1891, including the 1887 Scottish Cup.<ref name = "m256"/><ref name = "hibs honours"/> The club were admitted to the [[Scottish Football League]] in 1893, although they had to win the Second Division twice before being elected into the First Division in 1895.<ref name = "crampsey"/>

Hibs had some success after being reformed, winning the [[1901–02 Scottish Cup|1902 Scottish Cup]] and their first [[List of Scottish football champions|league championship]] a year later. After this, however, the club endured a long barren spell. The club lost its placing in the league, and were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] for the first time in 1931, although they were promoted back to the top division two years later. The notorious Scottish Cup [[drought (sport)|drought]]<ref name = "Cup of woe">{{Cite news|last=Black |first=Jim |url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2251647,00.html |title=Hibs' Cup of woe adds to strife of Reilly |work=[[The Observer]]|publisher= |date=3 February 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> began as they reached three cup finals, two in consecutive years, but lost each of them.

===The Famous Five (1939–1959)===
[[File:Famous Five mural.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Picture depicting [[The Famous Five (football)|the Famous Five]] at [[Easter Road]] stadium.]]
Hibs' most successful era by far, was in the decade following the end of the [[Second World War]], when it was "among the foremost clubs in Britain".<ref name = "Bobby Johnstone"/> The [[forward (association football)|forward]] line of [[Gordon Smith (Hibernian)|Gordon Smith]], [[Bobby Johnstone]], [[Lawrie Reilly]], [[Eddie Turnbull]] and [[Willie Ormond]], collectively known as [[The Famous Five (football)|the Famous Five]], is "regarded as the finest ever seen in Scottish football".<ref name = "Bobby Johnstone">{{Cite web|last=Gordon |first=Phil |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bobby-johnstone-729354.html |title=Bobby Johnstone |work=The Independent|publisher= |date=24 August 2001 |accessdate=22 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226005513/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bobby-johnstone-729354.html |archivedate=26 December 2008}}</ref> The quality of the Famous Five is shown by the fact that all five players scored more than 100 goals for the club,<ref name = "Bobby Johnstone"/> with the north stand at [[Easter Road]] now named in their honour.

Of the five, only Ormond cost Hibs a transfer fee, [[British pound sterling|£]]1200 from [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]].<ref>{{harvnb|Jeffrey|2005|p=125}}</ref> Reilly, Johnstone, Smith and Turnbull were all signed from youth or junior leagues.<ref name = "Bobby Johnstone"/><ref name = "lawrie load of goals"/> The first time Hibs used all five in the same team was on 21 April 1949, in a [[friendly match]] against [[Nithsdale Wanderers F.C.|Nithsdale Wanderers]].<ref name = "lawrie load of goals"/> The forward line remained in place until 1955, when Johnstone was sold to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].<ref name = "Bobby Johnstone"/> The great forward line, together with players like [[Bobby Combe]] and [[Tommy Younger]], largely contributed to the winning of league championships in 1948, 1951 and 1952.<ref name = "Bobby Johnstone"/><ref name = "lawrie load of goals"/> The team were perhaps unfortunate not to win more trophies, as they finished second to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in 1953 on [[goal average]], and second to Rangers by a point in 1950.<ref name = "Bobby Johnstone"/>

Despite only finishing fifth in the Scottish League in 1955, Hibs were invited to participate in the first season of the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]], which was not strictly based on league positions at that time.<ref name = "European Union"/> Eighteen clubs who were thought would generate interest across Europe and who also had the [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] necessary to play games at night, were invited to participate.<ref name = "European Union">{{Cite news|last=Wilson |first=Richard |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article545013.ece |title=European Union |work=The Sunday Times|publisher=News International |date=17 July 2005 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> Floodlights had been used at [[Easter Road]] for the first time in a [[friendly match]] against Hearts on 18 October 1954.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/19541018.html |title=Mon 18 Oct 1954 |publisher=London Hearts Supporters' Club |work=Londonhearts.com |accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref> Hibs became the first British club in Europe because the [[Football League]] secretary [[Alan Hardaker]] persuaded [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], the [[English football champions|English champions]], not to enter.<ref>{{Cite news|authorlink=Brian Glanville |last=Glanville |first=Brian |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article385542.ece |title=The great Chelsea surrender |work=The Times |date=27 April 2005 |accessdate=22 February 2010}}</ref>

Hibs played their first tie against [[Rot-Weiss Essen]], winning 4–0 in the [[Georg-Melches-Stadion]]<ref name = "European Union"/> and drawing 1–1 at Easter Road. They defeated [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]] to reach the semi-final,<ref name = "European Union"/> but in that tie they were defeated 3–0 on [[Two-legged tie|aggregate]] by [[Stade Reims]],<ref name = "European Union"/> who had the famous [[France national football team|France international]] player [[Raymond Kopa]] in their side.<ref name = "European Union"/> Reims lost 4–3 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in the [[1956 European Cup Final|Final]].<ref name = "European Union"/>

===Turnbull's Tornadoes (1960–1989)===

The team, popularly known as ''Turnbull's Tornadoes'', finished second in the league in 1974 and 1975, and won the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] in 1972. The club also won the [[Drybrough Cup]] in 1972 and 1973,<ref name = "history"/> and recorded a 7–0 win over [[Edinburgh derby]] rivals Hearts, at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]] on 1 January 1973.

Performances went into decline after the mid-1970s, as Hibs were replaced by the [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]] of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] as the main challengers to the [[Old Firm]]. Turnbull resigned as manager and Hibs were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]], for the second time in their history, in 1980. They were immediately [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] back to the [[Scottish Premier Division]] in 1981, but the club struggled during the 1980s, failing to qualify for European competition until 1989.<ref name = "history"/>
