{{Five oceans}}
The '''Indian Ocean''' is the third largest of the world's [[ocean]]ic divisions, covering {{Convert|70,560,000|km2|abbr=on}} (approximately 20% of the [[water]] on the [[Earth]]'s surface).<ref name="Rasul">{{Harvnb|Rais|1986|p=33}}</ref> It is bounded by [[Asia]] on the north, on the west by [[Africa]], on the east by [[Australia]], and on the south by the [[Southern Ocean]] or, depending on definition, by [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indian%20ocean|title='Indian Ocean' — Merriam-Webster Dictionary Online|accessdate=7 July 2012|quote=ocean E of Africa, S of Asia, W of Australia, & N of Antarctica area ab {{convert|73427795|km2}}}}</ref> It is named after [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=indian+ocean&searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|last=Harper|first=Douglas|work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref> The Indian Ocean is known as ''Ratnākara'' ([[Sanskrit]]: रत्नाकर), "''the mine of gems''", in ancient [[Sanskrit]] literature and as ''Hind Mahāsāgar'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: हिन्द महासागर), "''the great Indian sea''", in [[Hindi]].

==Geography==
[[File:1658 Jansson Map of the Indian Ocean (Erythrean Sea) in Antiquity - Geographicus - ErythraeanSea-jansson-1658.jpg|thumb|right|300px| A -[[17th century]]- 1658 [[Naval]] Map by [[Jan Janssonius|Janssonius]] depicting the Indian [[Ocean]], [[India]] and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]].]]

The [[Borders of the oceans#Indian Ocean|borders of the Indian Ocean]], as delineated by the [[International Hydrographic Organization]] in 1953 included the Southern Ocean but not the marginal seas along the northern rim, but in 2000 the IHO delimited the Southern Ocean separately, which removed waters south of 60°S from the Indian Ocean, but included the northern marginal seas.<ref>{{Harvnb|IHO|1953}}; {{Harvnb|IHO|2002}}</ref>  [[Meridional]]ly, the Indian Ocean is delimited from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by the [[20th meridian east|20° east meridian]], running south from [[Cape Agulhas]], and from the [[Pacific Ocean]] by the meridian of 146°55'E, running south from the southernmost point of [[Tasmania]]. The northernmost extent of the Indian Ocean is approximately [[30th parallel north|30° north]] in the [[Persian Gulf]].

The ocean covers {{Convert|70,560,000|km2|abbr=on}}, including the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]] but excluding the [[Southern Ocean]], or 19.5% world's oceans; its volume is {{Convert|264,000,000|km3|abbr=on}} or 19.8% of oceans volume; it has an average depth of {{Convert|3741|m|abbr=on}} and a maximum depth of {{Convert|7906|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Harvnb|Eakins|Sharman|2010}}</ref>

The ocean's continental shelves are narrow, averaging {{convert|200|km}} in width. An exception is found off Australia's western coast, where the shelf width exceeds {{convert|1000|km}}. The average depth of the ocean is {{Convert|3890|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. Its deepest point is [[Diamantina Deep]] in [[Diamantina Trench]], at {{Convert|8047|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} deep; also sometimes considered is [[Sunda Trench]], at a depth of {{Convert|7258|-|7725|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.  North of [[50th parallel south|50° south latitude]], 86% of the main basin is covered by [[pelagic]] sediments, of which more than half is [[Globigerina|globigerina ooze]]. The remaining 14% is layered with [[terrigenous]] sediments. Glacial outwash dominates the extreme southern latitudes.

The major choke points include [[Bab el Mandeb]], [[Strait of Hormuz]], the [[Lombok Strait]], the [[Strait of Malacca]] and the [[Palk Strait]]. Seas include the [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Andaman Sea]], [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], [[Great Australian Bight]], [[Laccadive Sea]], [[Gulf of Mannar]], [[Mozambique Channel]], [[Gulf of Oman]], [[Persian Gulf]], [[Red Sea]] and other tributary water bodies. The Indian Ocean is artificially connected to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] through the [[Suez Canal]], which is accessible via the Red Sea.

===Marginal seas===

==Climate==
The climate north of the [[equator]] is affected by a [[monsoon]] climate. Strong north-east winds blow from October until April; from May until October south and west winds prevail. In the Arabian Sea the violent Monsoon brings rain to the Indian subcontinent. In the southern hemisphere, the winds are generally milder, but summer storms near Mauritius can be severe. When the monsoon winds change, cyclones sometimes strike the shores of the Arabian Sea and the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The Indian Ocean is the warmest ocean in the world.

==Oceanography==
Among the few large rivers flowing into the Indian Ocean are the [[Zambezi]], [[Shatt al-Arab]], [[Indus River|Indus]], [[Godavari]], [[Krishna]],  [[Narmada]], [[Ganges River|Ganges]], [[Brahmaputra]], [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Irrawaddy River]]. The ocean's [[Ocean current|currents]] are mainly controlled by the monsoon. Two large [[gyre]]s, one in the northern hemisphere flowing clockwise and one south of the equator moving anticlockwise (including the [[Agulhas Current]] and [[Agulhas Return Current]]), constitute the dominant flow pattern. During the winter monsoon, however, currents in the north are reversed.

Deep water circulation is controlled primarily by inflows from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Red Sea]], and Antarctic currents. North of [[20th parallel south|20° south latitude]] the minimum surface temperature is {{convert|22|C}}, exceeding {{convert|28|C}} to the east. Southward of [[40th parallel south|40° south latitude]], temperatures drop quickly.

Precipitation and evaporation leads to [[salinity]] variation in all oceans, and in the Indian Ocean salinity variations are driven by: (1) river inflow mainly from the [[Bay of Bengal]], (2) fresher water from the [[Indonesian Throughflow]]; and (3) saltier water from the [[Red Sea]] and [[Persian Gulf]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Han|McCreary Jr|2001|loc=Introduction, p. 859}}</ref>
Surface water salinity ranges from 32 to 37 parts per 1000, the highest occurring in the Arabian Sea and in a belt between southern Africa and south-western Australia. Pack ice and icebergs are found throughout the year south of about [[65th parallel south|65° south latitude]]. The average northern limit of icebergs is [[45th parallel south|45° south latitude]].

==Geology==
[[File:Indian Ocean bathymetry srtm.png|thumb|[[Bathymetry|Bathymetric]] map of the Indian Ocean]]
{{Main category|Landforms of the Indian Ocean}}
As the youngest of the major oceans,<ref>{{Harvnb|Stow|2006|loc=Map of Indian Ocean, p. 127}}</ref> the Indian Ocean has active spreading ridges that are part of the worldwide system of [[mid-ocean ridge]]s.  In the Indian Ocean these spreading ridges meet at the [[Rodrigues Triple Point]] with the [[Central Indian Ridge]], including the [[Carlsberg Ridge]], separating the [[African Plate]] from the [[Indian Plate]]; the [[Southwest Indian Ridge]] separating the African Plate form the [[Antarctic Plate]]; and the [[Southeast Indian Ridge]] separating the [[Australian Plate]] from the [[Antarctic Plate]].The [[Central Indian Ridge|Central]] Ridge runs north on the in-between across of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and [[Africa]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]].    

A series of ridges and [[seamount chain]]s produced by [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]] pass over the Indian Ocean.  The [[Réunion hotspot]] (active 70-40 Ma) connects [[Réunion]] and the [[Mascarene Plateau]] to the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]] and the [[Deccan Traps]] in north-western India; the [[Kerguelen hotspot]] (100-35 Ma) connects the [[Kerguelen Islands]] and [[Kerguelen Plateau]] to the [[Ninety East Ridge]] and the [[Rajmahal Traps]] in north-eastern India; the [[Marion hotspot]] (100-70 Ma) possibly connects [[Prince Edward Islands]] to the [[Eighty Five East Ridge]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Müller|Royer|Lawver|1993|loc=Fig. 1, p. 275}}</ref>  It should be noted that these hotspot tracks have been broken by the still active spreading ridges mentioned above.

==Marine life==
Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of [[plankton|phytoplankton]] blooms in summer, due to the strong [[monsoon]] winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean [[upwelling]], which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable [[tuna]] catch.<ref name="FAO-2016">{{Harvnb|FAO|2016}}</ref> Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from [[Russia]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]] also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for [[shrimp]] and tuna.<ref name="CIAWFB-1994">{{Harvnb|CIA World Factbook|2015}}</ref>

Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades.<ref name="Roxy-2016">{{Harvnb|Roxy|2016}}</ref> The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.<ref name="Roxy-2016" />

Endangered marine species include the [[dugong]], [[seal (mammal)|seals]], [[turtle]]s, and [[whale]]s.<ref name="CIAWFB-1994" />

An [[Indian Ocean garbage patch]] was discovered in 2010 covering at least {{Convert|5|e6km2}}.  Riding the southern [[Indian Ocean Gyre]], this vortex of [[Plastic pollution|plastic garbage]] constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the [[Mozambique Channel]], and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.

==History==
[[File:Silk route copy.jpg|thumb|300px|The economically important [[Silk Road]] (red) and spice [[trade routes]] (blue) were blocked by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in ca. 1453 with the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. This spurred exploration, and a new sea route around Africa was found, triggering the [[Age of Discovery]].]]

===First settlements===
The history of the Indian Ocean is marked by maritime trade; cultural and commercial exchange probably date back at least seven thousand years.<ref name="Alpers-pp1-2">{{Harvnb|Alpers|2013|loc=Chapter 1. Imagining the Indian Ocean, pp. 1-2}}</ref>  During this period, independent, short-distance oversea communications along its [[littoral]] margins have evolved into an all-embracing network.  The début of this network was not the achievement of a centralised or advanced civilisation but of local and regional exchange in the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and Arabian Sea.  Sherds of [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] (2500-500 BCE) pottery have been found in the western Gulf at [[Dilmun]], present-day [[Bahrain]]; traces of exchange between this trading centre and [[Mesopotamia]].  [[Sumer]]ian traded grain, pottery, and [[bitumen]] (used for [[reed boat]]s) for copper, stone, timber, tin, dates, onions, and pearls.<ref name="Alpers-pp19-22">{{Harvnb|Alpers|2013|loc=Chapter 2. The Ancient Indian Ocean, pp. 19-22}}</ref>
Coast-bound vessels transported goods between the [[Harappa]] civilisation (2600–1900 [[BCE]]) in India (modern-day Pakistan and Gujarat in India) and the Persian Gulf and Egypt.<ref name="Alpers-pp1-2" />

''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', an [[Alexandria]]n guide to the world beyond the Red Sea&nbsp;— including Africa and India&nbsp;— from the first century CE, not only gives insights into trade in the region but also shows that Roman and Greek sailors had already gained knowledge about the [[monsoon]] winds.<ref name="Alpers-pp1-2" />  The contemporaneous settlement of [[Madagascar]] by [[Indonesia]]n sailors shows that the littoral margins of the Indian Ocean were being both well-populated and regularly traversed at least by this time.  Albeit the monsoon must have been common knowledge in the Indian Ocean for centuries.<ref name="Alpers-pp1-2" />

The world's earliest civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]] (beginning with [[Sumer]]), [[ancient Egypt]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]] (beginning with the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley civilization]]), which began along the valleys of the [[Tigris]]-[[Euphrates]], [[Nile]] and [[Indus River|Indus]] rivers respectively, all developed around the Indian Ocean. Civilizations soon arose in [[Iran|Persia]] (beginning with [[Elam]]) and later in [[Southeast Asia]] (beginning with [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]]).

During [[Egypt]]'s first dynasty (c. 3000 BC), sailors were sent out onto its waters, journeying to [[Punt (region)|Punt]], thought to be part of present-day [[Somalia]]. Returning ships brought gold and myrrh. The earliest known maritime trade between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley (c. 2500 BC) was conducted along the Indian Ocean. [[Phoenicia]]ns of the late 3rd millennium BC may have entered the area, but no settlements resulted.

The Indian Ocean's relatively calmer waters opened the areas bordering it to trade earlier than the Atlantic or [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. The powerful monsoons also meant ships could easily sail west early in the season, then wait a few months and return eastwards. This allowed ancient [[Indonesia]]n peoples to cross the Indian Ocean to settle in [[Madagascar]] around 2000 BP.<ref>{{Harvnb|Fitzpatrick|Callaghan|2009}}</ref>

===Era of discovery===
In the 2nd or 1st century BC, [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] was the first [[Greece|Greek]] to cross the Indian Ocean.  The probably fictitious sailor [[Hippalus]] is said to have discovered the direct route from [[Arabia]] to India around this time.<ref>{{Harvnb|UNESCO|Greatest Imporium}}</ref>  During the 1st and 2nd centuries AD intensive [[Roman commerce|trade relations]] developed between [[Roman Egypt]] and the [[Tamil people|Tamil kingdoms]] of the [[Chera Dynasty|Cheras]], [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]] and [[Pandyas]] in [[South India|Southern India]]. Like the Indonesian peoples above, the western sailors used the monsoon to cross the ocean. The unknown author of the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' describes this route, as well as the commodities that were traded along various commercial ports on the coasts of the Horn of Africa and India circa 1 AD. Among these trading settlements were [[Mosylon]] and [[Opone]] on the Red Sea littoral.

Unlike the Pacific Ocean where the civilization of the [[Polynesians]] reached most of the far flung islands and atolls and populated them, almost all the islands, archipelagos and atolls of the Indian Ocean were uninhabited until colonial times. Although there were numerous ancient civilizations in the coastal states of Asia and parts of Africa, the [[Maldives]] were the only island group in the Central Indian Ocean region where an ancient civilization flourished.<ref>{{Harvnb|UNESCO|2004|loc=Els maldivians: Mariners llegedaris, pp. 32–38}}</ref> [[Dhivehi people|Maldivian]] ships used the [[Indian Monsoon Current]] to travel to the nearby coasts.<ref>{{Cite web

From 1405 to 1433, Admiral [[Zheng He]] led large fleets of the [[Ming Dynasty]] on several [[treasure voyages]] through the Indian Ocean, ultimately reaching the coastal countries of [[East Africa]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Dreyer|2007|p=1}}</ref>

[[Image:Dorsetshire&Cornwall.jpg|thumb|British heavy cruisers ''[[HMS Dorsetshire (40)|Dorsetshire]]'' and ''[[HMS Cornwall (56)|Cornwall]]'' under Japanese air attack and heavily damaged on 5 April 1942]]
In 1497, Portuguese navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and became the first European to sail to India and later the [[Far East]]. The European ships, armed with heavy cannon, quickly dominated trade. [[Portugal]] achieved pre-eminence by setting up forts at the important straits and ports. Their hegemony along the coasts of Africa and Asia lasted until the mid 17th century. Later, the Portuguese were challenged by other European powers. The [[Dutch East India Company]] (1602–1798) sought control of trade with the East across the Indian Ocean. [[France]] and Britain established trade companies for the area. From 1565, [[Spain]] established a major trading operation with the [[Manila Galleons]] in the [[Philippines]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Pacific]]. Spanish trading ships purposely avoided the Indian Ocean, following the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] with Portugal. By 1815, Britain became the principal power in the Indian Ocean.

===Industrial era===
The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 revived European interest in the East, but no nation was successful in establishing trade dominance. Since [[World War II]] the United Kingdom was forced to withdraw from the area, to be replaced by India, the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and the [[United States]]. The last two tried to establish hegemony{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} by negotiating for naval base sites. Developing countries bordering the ocean, however, seek to have it made a "zone of peace"{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} so that they may use its shipping lanes freely. The United Kingdom and United States maintain a military base on [[Diego Garcia]] atoll in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

=== Contemporary era ===
On 26 December 2004, the countries surrounding the Indian Ocean were hit by a [[tsunami]] caused by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. The waves resulted in more than 226,000 deaths and over 1 million people were left homeless.

In the late 2000s, the ocean evolved into a hub of [[Piracy in Somalia|pirate]] activity. By 2013, attacks off the Horn region's coast had steadily declined due to active private security and international navy patrols, especially by the Indian Navy.<ref name="Wapstoas">{{Harvnb|Bloomberg|22 July 2013}}</ref>

==Trade==
[[File:Lamu dhow 5.JPG|thumb|A [[dhow]] off the coast of Kenya]]
The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], and [[East Asia]] with [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]]. It carries a particularly heavy traffic of [[petroleum]] and petroleum products from the oil fields of the [[Persian Gulf]] and [[Indonesia]]. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore areas of [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iran]], [[India]], and [[Western Australia]]. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean.<ref name="CIAWFB-1994" /> Beach sands rich in heavy [[mineral]]s, and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[South Africa]], [[Indonesia]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Thailand]].

===Major ports and harbours===
{{Main|List of ports and harbours of the Indian Ocean}}
The [[Port of Singapore]] is the busiest port in the Indian Ocean, located in the Strait of Malacca where it meets the Pacific. [[Mumbai Port Trust|Mumbai]], [[Chennai Port|Chennai]], [[Port of Kolkata|Kolkata]], [[Kochi Port|Kochi]], [[Marmagao#Mormugao Port|Mormugao Port]], [[Mundra]], [[Panambur]], [[Hazira]], [[Port Blair]], [[Alang]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Paradip Port|Paradip]], [[Ennore]], [[Tuticorin Port|Tuticorin]] and [[Nagapattinam]] are the other major ports in India. South Asian ports include [[Port of Chittagong|Chittagong]] in [[Bangladesh]], [[Port of Colombo|Colombo]], [[Port of Hambantota|Hambantota]] and [[Galle]] in [[Sri Lanka]], and ports of [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]] province and [[Gwadar]], [[Balochistan]] province in Pakistan. [[Aden]] is a major port in [[Yemen]] and controls ships entering the [[Red Sea]]. Major African ports on the shores of the Indian Ocean include: [[Mombasa]] (Kenya), [[Port of Dar es Salaam|Dar es Salaam]], [[Zanzibar]] ([[Tanzania]]), [[Durban]], [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]], [[Richard's Bay]] ([[South Africa]]), [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] ([[Mozambique]]), and [[Port Louis]] ([[Mauritius]]). Zanzibar is especially famous for its spice export. Other major ports in the Indian Ocean include [[Muscat, Oman|Muscat]] ([[Oman]]), [[Yangon]] ([[Burma]]), [[Jakarta]], [[Medan]] ([[Indonesia]]), [[Fremantle]] (port servicing [[Perth]], [[Australia]]) and Dubai (UAE).

Chinese companies have made investments in several Indian Ocean ports, including [[Gwadar]], [[Hambantota]], [[Colombo]] and [[Sonadia]].  This has sparked a debate about the strategic implications of these investments.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brewster|2014}}</ref>

==Bordering countries and territories==
Small islands dot the continental rims. [[Island country|Island nations]] within the ocean are [[Madagascar]] (the [[list of islands by area|world's fourth largest island]]), [[Bahrain]], [[Comoros]], [[Maldives]], [[Mauritius]], [[Seychelles]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The archipelago of [[Indonesia]] and the island nation of [[East Timor]] border the ocean on the east.
