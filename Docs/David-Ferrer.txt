A three-time Davis Cup champion with Spain, Ferrer has won tournaments at all levels (ATP 250, ATP 500, Masters 1000) except at a Grand Slam, and currently has the 7th highest career prize money earnings of all time.

David Ferrer turned professional in 2000 and was in the first years of his career known as a clay-court specialist, having won half of his titles on the surface. However, he has had significant success on all surfaces, having reached the final of the [[French Open]] in 2013 (without losing two sets), the semifinals of the [[Australian Open|Australian]] and [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]s twice each, and the quarterfinals of [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] twice. He was part of the [[Spain Davis Cup team]] that won the finals in 2008, 2009, and 2011. He won the [[BNP Paribas Masters|Paris Masters]] in 2012, and he was runner-up at the [[Tennis Masters Cup]] in 2007.

== Career ==

=== Early years ===
Ferrer was born in [[Xàbia]] in the [[province of Alicante]], but he moved to [[Gandia]] at age thirteen, followed two years later by a move to [[Barcelona]] to attend the Catalan Tennis Federation. He spent nine months at Equelite, [[Juan Carlos Ferrero]]'s Academy in Villena, before moving back to Xàbia. During his time in the academy, the Spanish Federation chose to sponsor [[Tommy Robredo]] rather than him, forcing Ferrer on his own prior to turning professional.

Once, as a teenager, when Ferrer did not practice hard enough, his coach, Javier Piles, locked him in a completely dark 2m x 2m ball closet for several hours, giving him only a piece of bread and a bit of water. After this incident he was fed up with tennis and went to work at a construction site, but after a week he returned to Piles and asked if he could remain at the club and play tennis. Piles continued to coach Ferrer until they parted ways at the end of 2013. Ferrer has said he considers Piles to be like a second father to him.<ref>{{cite news|author=Katy Murrells |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/jun/06/andy-murray-david-ferrer-live |title=Andy Murray v David Ferrer – as it happened |publisher=theguardian.com |date= 6 June 2012|accessdate=2 February 2014 |location=London}}</ref>

This broke his streak of 5 consecutive finals wins from 2015.<ref>http://www.hindustantimes.com/tennis/qatar-open-rafael-nadal-survives-scare-defending-champion-david-ferrer-knocked-out/story-Bcgh7LPTCIm6Sivmox1upK.html</ref>

Ferrer made a strong start to his [[2016 Australian Open]] campaign by winning his first four round matches in straight sets, He defeated the former world number one  [[Lleyton Hewitt]] 6-2 6-4 6-4 in the second round. This was Hewitt's last singles match as a professional tennis player. He beat two Americans [[Steve Johnson (tennis)]] and tenth seed [[John Isner]] in the third and fourth round, respectively. Ferrer lost to [[Andy Murray]] in the quarterfinal despite being the only quarter-finalist to not drop a set the entire tournament. As a result, Ferrer went up to world no. 6. Ferrer next participated in the Argentina Open where he was seeded 2nd. Ferrer received a bye into the second round and made it to the semi-finals by beating Renzo Olivo and Pablo Cuevas. However, Ferrer lost to eventual runner-up Nicolas Almagro in straight sets.   

== Playing style and reputation ==

[[File:David Ferrer Practice.jpg|thumb|David Ferrer practices at the US Open]]

Ferrer is noted for being one of the more dogged, agile, and fit players on the tour, and he has won many matches with consistent baseline play, great fitness, footspeed, and determination.<ref>[http://www.espn.co.uk/tennis/sport/story/169409.html "Djokovic dispatches Ferrer to set up Murray showdown"], ''ESPN'', 9 September 2012.</ref> Although he does not possess powerful [[groundstroke]]s like many of his contemporaries, his ability to keep the ball deep in play and move his opponents around the court has allowed him to be successful on all surfaces, especially on clay and hard courts. Although he is not a great net player, Ferrer's foot speed allows him to quickly cut off his opponents' shots and volley whilst they're off balance. [[Darren Cahill]] has said that Ferrer and [[Novak Djokovic]] are the two best returners in the men's game, even surpassing former dominant return specialists like [[Andre Agassi]], who Cahill previously regarded as the best return specialist in the history of men's tennis. In 2007, [[Roger Federer]] regarded Ferrer as the best returner in the men's game.<ref name="DailyFixReturnGame">[http://blogs.wsj.com/dailyfix/2011/01/26/david-ferrers-elite-return-game/ "David Ferrer's Elite Return Game"], ''The Daily Fix'', 26 January 2011.</ref>
At a personal level, Ferrer's reputation on the tour is that of a humble and shy person,<ref>http://espn.go.com/tennis/story/_/id/7114916/tennis-forget-david-ferrer</ref> rarely being involved in any controversy throughout his career. Calm and disciplined, he is admired for his tenacity and competitiveness on the court.<ref>http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2014/10/43/Valencia-Ferrer-600-Match-Wins-Tribute.aspx</ref>

In February 2016, Ferrer featured in a video by the ATP titled "Ferrer Getting Better and Better". It highlighted the longevity of Ferrer's career, his fighting spirit, consistency and the success he has been able to achieve even at the age of 33. It pointed out that, despite his long career, Ferrer had his second best season ever in 2015 and that he was one of the best players ever to not have won a Grand Slam. In the video, Ferrer also reveals that his tennis idol growing up was [[Sergi Bruguera]]. <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUCmbbN7l58</ref>
