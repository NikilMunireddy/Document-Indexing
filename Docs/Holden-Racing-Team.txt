The '''Holden Racing Team''' ('''HRT''') is a [[Melbourne]] based motor racing team. Formed in 1990, it is the most successful [[V8 Supercars|V8 Supercar]] team in the history of the category, having won the [[Australian Touring Car Championship|driver's championship]] six times, and the series signature race, the [[Bathurst 1000]], seven times.

HRT is the factory team of Australian car manufacturer [[Holden]], and its performance vehicle partner [[Holden Special Vehicles]]. The team is based in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Clayton, Victoria|Clayton]].

The team's current full-time drivers, [[Garth Tander]] and [[James Courtney]], are contracted until the end of the [[2016 International V8 Supercars Championship|2016 season]].<ref>{{cite web|title=New two-year deal for Tander at HRT|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2014/05/14/new-multi-year-deal-tander-hrt/|work=Speedcafe|date=14 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=HRT confirms new three-year Courtney deal|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2013/07/28/hrt-confirms-new-three-year-courtney-deal/|work=Speedcafe|date=28 July 2013}}</ref>

==History==
===1980s===
{{main|Perkins Engineering}}
As part of the [[joint venture]] established in 1987 between [[Tom Walkinshaw]] and [[Holden]] to form [[Holden Special Vehicles]], [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] (TWR) was to run Holden’s motor sport programme. TWR were responsible for designing the [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV]], which was homologated for racing in August 1988 after Holden Special Vehicles completed the required 500.

For 1988 it was decided to contract out the racing programme to [[Perkins Engineering]] although a car built by TWR in the United Kingdom was raced by Tom Walkinshaw at the [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] Tourist Trophy and [[1988 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]].

For 1989 it was planned for TWR to run the full season with two cars. [[Win Percy]] and [[Neil Crompton]] were announced as the team’s drivers and a second VL Commodore built in the United Kingdom was tested in Holden Racing Team livery at [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder]] but with the likelihood of being mauled by the [[Ford Sierra RS500]]s, the [[1989 Australian Touring Car Championship|Australian Touring Car Championship]] programme was cancelled. For the [[1989 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]], [[1989 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] and [[1989 Australian Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] support races, the programme was once again contracted to [[Perkins Engineering]].

===1990s===
====1990====
[[File:Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV of Percy & Grice.jpg|thumb|The [[1990 Bathurst 1000]] winning [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV|VL Commodore]].]]
In 1990 the operation was brought in house with longtime TWR driver [[Win Percy]] moving to [[Melbourne]] to fill the role of both driver and team manager. Percy drove at all [[1990 Australian Touring Car Championship|Australian Touring Car Championship]] rounds except for [[Mallala Motor Sport Park|Mallala]] where [[Neil Crompton]] drove after Percy returned to England for a family bereavement.<ref>Nissan's First, 1990 Shell Australian Touring Car Championship, Australian Motor Racing Year 1990/91, pages 108–109</ref> Percy's highest qualifying position was sixth at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]] and highest race result a third place at [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]], and he finished eighth overall in the championship.

At the [[1990 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]], Percy and Crompton qualified the car fourth, however did not finish the race. For the [[1990 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] the team entered two cars with Percy, against the wishes of Holden and Tom Walkinshaw, recruiting [[Allan Grice]] to co-drive the lead car. Crompton was joined by [[Brad Jones (racing driver)|Brad Jones]]. With Percy suffering a shoulder injury, his decision to hire Grice was vindicated with the latter handling the bulk of the driving on the way to an unexpected victory, the second car finished fifth.

====1991====
For 1991 the [[Holden Commodore VN|VN Commodore]] was homologated with Win Percy driving in all ATCC rounds except [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]] where Allan Grice substituted while Percy competed in an event in Europe. Percy again finished eighth in the championship. At the [[1991 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst 1000]], Percy and Grice teamed together to finish second, with the second car of Neil Crompton and Brad Jones not finishing after running out of fuel.

====1992====
With Win Percy having decided to return to England, [[Tomas Mezera]] was hired. Due to a budget shortfall and the need to develop the [[Holden VP Commodore|VP Commodore]] for the new [[V8 Supercars|V8 formula]], HRT only competed at the [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown]], [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]] and [[Eastern Creek Raceway|Eastern Creek]] rounds. Two 1993 spec VP Commodores were raced at the [[1992 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] with Mezera and Brad Jones finishing third while Percy and Grice finished fifth at the [[1992 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]]. Mezera and Jones drove two cars at the [[1992 Australian Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] support races.

====1993====
With budget problems compounded by [[Castrol]] deciding to transfer its funding to [[Perkins Engineering]], at the beginning of 1993 there was some doubt as to whether the team would compete in the [[1993 Australian Touring Car Championship]]. Former [[1987 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1987 World 500cc]] champion [[Wayne Gardner]] with only one touring car start was signed as the team’s driver with Tomas Mezera’s participation being dependent on additional sponsorship being secured, however he would ultimately compete in all nine rounds.

At the [[1993 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] Mezera was joined by Michael Preston, with Brad Jones and Allan Grice in the second car. For the [[1993 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] Mezera was joined by Win Percy with Gardner and Jones driving the second car to a third-place finish. Gardner won a race at the [[1993 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]].

The team’s season was dominated by off-track politics. Before the end of the championship chief engineer Wally Storey and team manager Neal Lowe had left the team with Mezera appointed as acting team manager. Before the Sandown 500, Gardner was suspended for two weeks from the team. HRT alleged Gardner was trying to poach the team’s sponsors for his own operation, Gardner claimed that he was acting on a request by the team to help secure extra funding. Gardner secured funding from [[Coca-Cola]] for 1994, but his proposal for taking part ownership was rejected by Tom Walkinshaw and he elected to form [[Wayne Gardner Racing]]. At Bathurst, Jeff Grech commenced what would ultimately be a very successful stint as team manager.

====1994====
In 1994 [[Peter Brock]] was signed to drive for the team. In spite of some resistance by some within [[Holden]] after the manufacturer's split with Brock’s [[Holden Dealer Team]] in 1987, the substantial [[Mobil]] and [[NGK]] sponsorship he brought to the team made the deal irresistible. Both of these sponsors remain with the team in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.speedcafe.com/2015/02/25/holden-racing-team-launches-season-livery/|title=Holden Racing Team launches season livery|work=Speedcafe|date=25 February 2015}}</ref> The team was competitive throughout the [[1994 Australian Touring Car Championship|ATCC]], with Brock taking the round win at [[Eastern Creek Raceway|Eastern Creek]] and second places at [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown]], [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]], [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit|Philip Island]] and [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] on the way to a third-place finish, Mezera finished ninth.

Brock's win at Eastern Creek was the HRT's first ever ATCC round win.

For the endurance events, Brad Jones and [[Rickard Rydell]] (who was driving a [[Volvo 850]] for TWR in the [[1994 British Touring Car Championship season|British Touring Car Championship]]) were earmarked to drive the second car. However, with Rydell’s wife due to give birth, he was replaced by [[Craig Lowndes]] for the [[1994 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]]. After finishing fifth and setting the fastest lap of the four drivers, HRT elected to retain Lowndes for the [[1994 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]]. Despite Lowndes crashing in the warm up and spinning mid race, a stellar double stint from Jones saw the car finish second. The lead car crashed late in the race.

====1995====
For 1995 the [[Holden VR Commodore|VR Commodore]] was introduced. Brock remained a championship contender at the final round at Oran Park, finishing third with Mezera fifth. Lowndes and [[Greg Murphy]] ran the second car at the [[1995 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] and [[1995 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] however neither finished either race. After the [[1995 Australian Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] support race it was announced that Lowndes would drive for the team full-time in 1996, he would take Mezera’s seat for the season ending Brock Challenge at [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder]].

====1996====
[[File:Lowndes-vr96.jpg|thumb|The 1996 [[Holden VR Commodore|VR Commodore]] of [[Craig Lowndes]].]]
With the demise of tobacco sponsorship, HRT had been able to lure many key personnel from [[Gibson Motorsport]]. This helped the team dominate the 1996 season with Craig Lowndes winning the [[1996 Australian Touring Car Championship|ATCC]], [[1996 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] and [[1996 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]], the latter two in partnership with Greg Murphy. Brock finished the series in fourth being joined again by Tomas Mezera for the endurance races. With Lowndes headed to Europe in 1997 to compete in [[International Formula 3000|F3000]], Murphy was hired as his replacement and debuted at two races in New Zealand at the end of the year.

====1997====
The year saw a number of mechanical failures with the [[Holden VS Commodore|VS Commodores]] that prevented HRT from following on from the success of 1996. One highlight of the year were one-two finishes at both [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]] and [[Barbagallo Raceway|Wanneroo]]. Just before the [[Eastern Creek Raceway|Eastern Creek]] round of the series [[Peter Brock]] announced his retirement from full-time racing. Overall, Murphy and Brock finished the year fourth and sixth respectively. Lowndes returned to drive in the endurance events with Murphy, while [[Mark Skaife]] co-drove with Brock. Lowndes and Murphy won the [[1997 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] while despite Skaife winning pole at both events, he and Brock failed to finish.

At selected events a third car was entered under the [[Holden Young Lions]] banner with [[Jason Bargwanna]], [[Todd Kelly]], [[Mark Noske]] and Stephen White driving. Bargwanna and Noske drove a car in the endurance races.

====1998====
For 1998 Lowndes returned to HRT and Skaife succeeded Brock. Lowndes won the [[1998 Australian Touring Car Championship|ATCC]] with Skaife finishing third. At the [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder]] round Greg Murphy debuted the [[Holden VT Commodore|VT Commodore]].  Lowndes and Skaife finished second at the [[1998 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]]. At the [[1998 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] despite winning pole position and leading much of the race, Lowndes and Skaife suffered a number of tyre failures finishing sixth. The second car of Greg Murphy and [[Mark Noske]] suffered a crash in late qualifying causing them to miss the shootout and cause endless problems throughout the race including the same tyre woes that Lowndes and Skaife suffered and retired on lap 86.

====1999====
Lowndes again won the [[1999 Australian Touring Car Championship|ATCC]] with Skaife third despite Lowndes having to miss the [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]] round after a car destroying rollover at [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder]]. Endurance driver [[Cameron McConville]] deputised in Lowndes’s 1996 winning  [[Holden VS Commodore|VS Commodore]].
For the [[1999 Queensland 500|Queensland 500]] and [[1999 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]], Lowndes was joined by McConville finishing third and second respectively. Skaife was joined by  [[Paul Morris (motorsport)|Paul Morris]] finishing third at Bathurst.

A third car was entered in the endurance races under the [[Holden Young Lions]] with [[Todd Kelly]] and [[Mark Noske]] driving.

===2000s===
====2000====
In 2000 Skaife won the championship with Lowndes finishing in third. At the [[2000 Queensland 500|Queensland 500]] Lowndes and Skaife teamed together to win. The second car was driven by [[Todd Kelly]] and [[Nathan Pretty]], however failed to finish.  At the [[2000 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]], Lowndes and Skaife finished in sixth position with [[Jason Plato]] and [[Yvan Muller]]. Kelly raced the Holden Young Lions entry at some rounds being joined by Pretty at Bathurst.

Off-track Craig Lowndes wanted out of his ten-year management contract with Tom Walkinshaw and left the team at season’s end for [[Gibson Motorsport]].

====2001====
In 2001 [[Jason Bright]] joined the team. At the [[2001 Queensland 500|Queensland 500]] Skaife and Bright shared a car with [[Tony Longhurst]] and [[Tomas Mezera]] driving the second. For the [[2001 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] the lead drivers were split, Skaife and Longhurst winning. Skaife won the [[2001 V8 Supercar Championship Series|series]], Bright finished third.

====2002====
In 2002 Skaife again won the championship with Bright finishing fourth. HRT won the first eight rounds of the season. [[Jim Richards (race driver)|Jim Richards]] and Mezera drove the second car at the [[2002 Queensland 500|Queensland 500]]. At the [[2002 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] Skaife and Richards won with Bright and Mezera third. A third car was raced throughout the season under the Holden Young Lions banner by [[Rick Kelly]], finishing fourth at Bathurst with Nathan Pretty.

====2003====
[[File:Todd Kelly Barbagello.jpg|thumb|[[Todd Kelly]]'s [[Holden VY Commodore|VY Commodore]] at [[Barbagallo Raceway|Barbagallo]] in 2003.]]
In [[2003 V8 Supercar season|2003]] [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] collapsed and the team was put up for sale by the administrator. [[Holden]] purchased the team, but because manufacturers were prohibited from owning teams, it was quickly sold to Mark Skaife. Todd Kelly commenced a five-year stint as the driver of the second car. For the endurance races [[Jim Richards (race driver)|Jim Richards]] and [[Tony Longhurst]] rejoined the team. Skaife and Kelly won the [[2003 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] with Longhurst and Richards finishing in tenth. At the [[2003 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] Skaife and Kelly finished the race in eighth after being black flagged late in the race to repair accident damage with Richards and Longhurst fifth.

====2004====
In 2004 Kelly finished the championship in seventh place and Skaife in twelfth after one of his worst seasons on record where it included a number of driver errors and reliability issues. For the endurance events [[Jason Plato]] joined [[Peter Brock]] in the second car. Skaife and Kelly finished the [[2004 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] in fourteenth position, two laps down after a belt from the engine broke early in the race.

====2005====
In 2005 both Skaife and Kelly won rounds of the championship with Kelly winning the [[Shanghai International Circuit|Shanghai]] round. This victory gave HRT their 50th round win, the first team to do so. Skaife and Kelly won the [[2005 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]]. Jim Richards and [[James Courtney]] drove the second car, however failed to finish.

====2006====
In 2006 Kelly finished the season in sixth place and Skaife finished in a miserable sixteenth. Both drivers did have success during with Skaife winning at [[Pukekohe Park Raceway|Pukekohe]] and [[Barbagallo Raceway|Wanneroo]] and Kelly winning at [[Surfers Paradise Street Circuit|Surfers Paradise]] and [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit|Phillip Island]]. With HRT out of the title race by the time of the endurance races and the sister [[HSV Dealer Team]] having both its drivers in contention, it was controversially decided to split its drivers with [[Garth Tander]] driving with Skaife and Kelly with his brother [[Rick Kelly|Rick]] at the HSV Dealer Team. However the plan was not successful with the Skaife/Tander car finishing 26th at the [[2006 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] and crashing on lap 1 at [[2006 Bathurst 1000|Bathurst]] after a driveline failure. The second HRT car was driven by [[Jim Richards (race driver)|Jim Richards]] and [[Ryan Briscoe]] and finished in 21st at Sandown and did not finish at Bathurst.

====2007====
The [[2007 V8 Supercar season]] saw the debut of the new [[Holden VE Commodore|VE Commodore]].  Skaife finished sixth and Kelly seventh with post scoring race wins.

[[Glenn Seton]] and [[Nathan Pretty]] were signed to drive the second car.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.v8supercar.com.au/news/latestnews/newsdisplay.asp?Ind=M&gid=31372176|title=Seton joins Holden factory team|publisher=V8 Supercars Australia|date=16 February 2007}}</ref> However, with Skaife requiring appendix surgery the week before the [[2007 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]], a reshuffle saw Kelly and Pretty paired in one car and Seton and [[Tony Longhurst]] in the second.

====2008====
[[File:Tander at L&H 500 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Holden VE Commodore|VE Commodore]] of [[Garth Tander]] and [[Mark Skaife]] at the [[2008 L&H 500]].]]

===Ownership Battle===
At the start of the 2007 season, a battle erupted over the ownership of HRT. Skaife had been hounded by governing body, the Touring Car Entrants Group of Australia (TEGA), for more than four months for paperwork proving compliance with the Teams' Licence Agreement, but had failed to show the required information. He was given until 12 March to provide the evidence, or the team could be removed from the V8 Touring Car Competition.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/motorsport/kelly-takes-flag-as-gore-turns-up-heat-on-skaife/2007/03/03/1172868807490.html Kelly takes the first flag as Gore turns up heat on Skaife] ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 3 March 2007</ref>

Skaife managed to produce sufficient evidence and TEGA allowed HRT to continue racing. A commercial settlement was struck between Skaife and TEGA that ensured that Skaife, and not Holden Motor Sport owner [[Tom Walkinshaw]], had ownership and control over the team.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21429121-39478,00.html Kelly retains one-track mind] ‘’Herald Sun’’</ref> It has been revealed that Tom Walkinshaw owned a 50% stake in Skaife Sports.<ref>[http://editorial.carsales.com.au/Story/News/2007/Motorsport-Walkinshaw-half-owner-of-HRT/2442182.aspx Motorsport: Walkinshaw half-owner of HRT (March 2007)]</ref> Subsequently in December 2008 Skaife sold his remaining interest in HRT to Walkinshaw.<ref>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/skaife-sells-up-before-last-race/story-e6frg7mo-1111118195567 Mark Skaife sells up before last race] Retrieved on 18 December 2010</ref>
