[[File:Italian Football Champion 1901.jpg|thumb|right|A.C. Milan team in 1901]]
A.C. Milan was founded as ''Milan Cricket and Foot-Ball Club'' on 13 December 1899 by English expatriates [[Alfred Edwards (football)|Alfred Edwards]] and [[Herbert Kilpin]],<ref name="founding"/> who came from the English city of [[Nottingham]]. In honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the [[city]]'s name, as opposed to the Italian spelling ''Milano'', which it was forced to bear under the [[Italian Fascism|fascist regime]]. Milan won its first Italian championship in [[Italian Football Championship 1901|1901]] and a further two in succession in [[Italian Football Championship 1906|1906]] and [[Italian Football Championship 1907|1907]].<ref name="history"/>

In 1908, Milan experienced a split caused by internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players, which led to the forming of another Milan-based team, [[Inter Milan|F.C. Internazionale Milano]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inter.it/en/societa/storia.html |title=Inter – History |publisher=F.C.

This was one of the club's most successful periods domestically, with the [[Scudetto]] going to Milan in [[1950–51 Serie A|1951]], [[1954–55 Serie A|1955]], [[1956–57 Serie A|1957]], [[1958–59 Serie A|1959]] and [[1961–62 Serie A|1962]].<ref name="honours"/> In 1963, Milan won its first continental title by beating [[S.L.

Milan won a [[List of Italian football champions|tenth league title]] in [[1978–79 Serie A|1979]], but after the retirement of [[Gianni Rivera]] in the same year, the team went into a period of decline. The club was involved in the [[Totonero 1980|1980 Totonero scandal]] and as punishment was [[1979–80 Serie A|relegated]] to [[Serie B]] for the first time in its history.<ref name="totonero">{{cite news |title=The worst scandal of them all |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5215260.stm |author=Dan Warren |work=BBC Sport |publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=25 July 2006|accessdate=4 October 2010}}</ref> The scandal was centred around a betting syndicate paying players and officials to fix the outcome of matches.<ref name="totonero"/> Milan achieved promotion back to [[Serie A]] at the first attempt, winning the [[1980–81 Serie B]] title,<ref name="honours"/> but were again relegated a year later as the team ended its [[1981–82 Serie A|1981–82]] campaign in third-last place. In [[1982–83 Serie B|1983]], Milan won the Serie B title for the second time in three seasons to return to Serie A,<ref name="honours"/> where they achieved a sixth-place finish in [[1983–84 Serie A|1983–84]].

On 20 February 1986, entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] acquired the club and saved it from bankruptcy after investing vast amounts of money,<ref name="history"/> appointing rising manager [[Arrigo Sacchi]] at the helm of the ''Rossoneri'' and signing [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch]] internationals [[Ruud Gullit]], [[Marco van Basten]] and [[Frank Rijkaard]].<ref name="history"/> The Dutch trio added an attacking impetus to the team, and complemented the club's [[Italy national football team|Italian]] internationals [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Franco Baresi]], [[Alessandro Costacurta]] and [[Roberto Donadoni]]. Under Sacchi, Milan won its first Scudetto in nine years in the [[1987–88 Serie A|1987–88 season]]. The following year, the club won its first [[1987–88 European Cup|European Cup]] in two decades, beating Romanian club [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]] 4–0 in [[1989 European Cup Final|the final]]. Milan retained their title with a [[1990 European Cup Final|1–0 win]] over Benfica a year later and remain the last team to win back-to-back [[European Champion Clubs' Cup|European Cup]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2013/may/24/great-european-cup-teams-milan|title=The great European Cup teams: Milan 1989–90|date=24 May 2013|accessdate=7 June 2013|work=The Guardian}}</ref> The Milan team of [[1989–90 A.C.

After Sacchi left Milan in 1991, he was replaced by the club's former player [[Fabio Capello]] whose team won three consecutive [[List of Italian football champions|Serie A titles]] between [[1991–92 Serie A|1992]] and [[1993–94 Serie A|1994]], a spell which included a 58-match unbeaten run in Serie A<ref name=fabio>{{cite news|url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/archive/show_player/Fabio-Capello|title=Fabio Capello|accessdate=7 June 2013|work=A.C.

Milan's next period of success came under another former player, [[Carlo Ancelotti]].

Red and black are the colours which have represented the club throughout its entire history. They were chosen to represent the players' fiery ardor (red) and the opponents' fear to challenge the team (black). ''Rossoneri'', the team's widely used nickname, literally means "the red & blacks" in Italian, in reference to the colours of the stripes on its jersey.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pt.uefa.com/printoutfiles/competitions/supercup/2007/e/e_300912_pr.pdf|publisher=UEFA.com|title=AC Milan – Sevilla FC|date=25 July 2007|format=PDF}}</ref>

Another nickname derived from the club's colours is ''[[the Devil]]''. An image of a red devil was used as Milan's logo at one point with a ''[[star (football badge)|Golden Star for Sport Excellence]]'' located next to it.<ref name="weltfussball"/> As is customary in Italian football, the star above the logo was awarded to the club after winning 10 league titles, in 1979. For many years, Milan's badge was simply the [[Flag of Milan]], which was originally the flag of [[Saint Ambrose]].<ref name="weltfussball">{{cite news|url=http://www.weltfussballarchiv.com/Vereinsprofilnew.php?ID=3002|publisher=WeltFussballArchiv.com|title=AC Milan|date=25 July 2007}}</ref> The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the ''[[Comune]] di [[Milan]]o'', with the acronym ''ACM'' at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom.<ref name="weltfussball"/>

White shorts and black socks are usually worn as part of the home strip. Milan's away strip has always been completely white.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acmilan.com/en/news/show/148006|title=ADIDAS AND AC MILAN PRESENT 2013-14 AWAY JERSEY|work=acmilan.com}}</ref> It is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, due to the fact that Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 1995 and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red trimmings in recent seasons.

{{Details|San Siro}}

===Giuseppe Meazza Stadium===
The team's stadium is the 80,018 seat [[San Siro]], officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the [[Giuseppe Meazza|former player]] who represented both Milan and [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]]. The more commonly used name, "San Siro", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, [[Piero Pirelli]]. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13-and-a-half months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city council in 1935, and since 1947, it has been shared with Internazionale when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant.

The first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6–3 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to [[Sampierdarenese]]. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity has been reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by [[UEFA]].

Based on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of [[flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems.

===AC Milan Emirates Stadium===
On 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director [[Adriano Galliani]] announced that the club is seriously working towards a relocation. He said that Milan's new stadium will be largely based on the [[Veltins-Arena]] – the home of [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] in [[Gelsenkirchen]] – and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium will likely be used for football only, having no athletics track.

On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in [[Portello (district of Milan)|Portello]], behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square "Piazza Gino Valle". The new village with shopping malls and hotel is located near [[CityLife (Milan)|CityLife]] district and is served by the [[Milan Metro|metro]].<ref name=rep3sep>{{cite news |url=http://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/14_dicembre_11/ecco-nuovo-stadio-milan-arena-42-mila-posti-portello-ae033168-8116-11e4-98b8-fc3cd6b38980.shtml |title=Ecco il nuovo stadio del Milan Arena da 42 mila posti al Portello |newspaper=Corriere della Sera |date=11 December 2014}}</ref>

On 20 September 2015, however, Silvio Berlusconi has called an end to his club's plans to build a new stadium in the city.<ref name=rep20sep>{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.us/ac-milan/story/2623771/ac-milan-stay-at-san-siro-after-scrapping-new-stadium-plans |title=AC Milan to stay at San Siro after scrapping plans to build new stadium |newspaper=espnfc.us |date=11 September 2015}}</ref>

According to a study from 2010, Milan is the most supported Italian team in Europe and seventh overall, with over 18.4 million fans.<ref name="Sport+Markt"/> It had the ninth highest average attendance of European football clubs during the 2010–11 season, behind [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Hamburger SV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ger.1/year/2010/german-bundesliga?cc=5901 |title=German Bundesliga Stats: Team Attendance – 2010–11 |publisher=''[[ESPNsoccernet]]'' }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://arxiu.fcbarcelona.cat/web/english/noticies/club/temporada10-11/05/17/n110517117527.html|title=Camp Nou: Average attendance 79,390|work=fcbarcelona.cat}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/eng.1/year/2010/barclays-premier-league?cc=5901 |title= Barclays Premier League Stats: Team Attendance – 2010–11 |publisher=''[[ESPNsoccernet]]'' }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ESP.1/year/2010/spanish-primera-division?cc=5901 |title=Spanish La Liga Stats: Team Attendance – 2010–11 |publisher=''[[ESPNsoccernet]]'' }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/stats/attendance/_/league/ita.1/year/2010/italian-serie-a?cc=5901 |title=Italian Serie A Stats: Team Attendance – 2010–11 |publisher=''[[ESPNsoccernet]]'' }}</ref>

|publisher=ItalyMag.co.uk|title= Genoa Bans Milan Fans From Sunday Match|date=29 June 2007}}</ref> Milan's main rivalry, however, is with its neighbour club, Internazionale, where both clubs meet in the widely anticipated [[Derby della Madonnina]] twice every Serie A season. The name of the derby refers to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], whose statue atop the [[Milan Cathedral]] is one of the city's main attractions. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game. [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|Flares]] are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the [[2004–05 UEFA Champions League|2004–05 Champions League]] quarter-final match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan goalkeeper [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]] on the shoulder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4432047.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Milan game ended by crowd trouble|date=25 July 2007}}</ref>

==Honours==
Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italy, having won a total of 29 major trophies, and was the most successful club in the world in terms of international trophies until February 2014, when [[Al Ahly SC]] claimed that title.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.football-italia.net/45554/milan-lose-most-successful-title | title=Milan lose 'most successful' title | publisher=Football Italia | date=22 February 2014 | accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://en.starafrica.com/football/egypte-al-ahly-more-successful-than-ac-milan-and-boca-juniors.html | title=Egyptian side Al Ahly more successful than AC Milan and Boca Juniors | publisher=Star Africa | date=22 February 2014 | accessdate=22 December 2014 | author=Krichi, Zaki}}</ref> It is now the third-most successful club behind [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and Al Ahly with a record of 14 European trophies and four world titles. Milan has earned the right to place a [[star (football badge)|star]] on its jersey in recognition of the fact that it has won at least ten ''[[List of Italian football champions|scudetti]]''. In addition, the club is permanently allowed to display a [[UEFA badge of honour|multiple-winner badge]] on its shirt as it has won more than five European Championship Cups.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://worldsoccer.about.com/od/clubfootball/tp/badgeofhonour.htm|publisher=About.com|title=Top 5 UEFA's Badge of Honour Winners|date=25 July 2007}}</ref>

==Club statistics and records==
{{Details|List of A.C. Milan records and statistics}}
[[File:Paolo Maldini press conference in Tehran.jpg|thumb|[[Paolo Maldini]] made a record 902 appearances for Milan, including 647 in Serie A]]
[[Paolo Maldini]] holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Milan, with 902 official games played in total and 647 in Serie A (as of 31 May 2009, not including playoff matches),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/Squadre/Milan/Primo_Piano/2007/05_Maggio/14/MALDINI.shtml|title=Maldini infinito: e sono 600|publisher=[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]|accessdate=14 January 2010|date =14 May 2001|language=Italian}}</ref> the latter being an all-time Serie A record.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4280590.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Maldini sets new Serie A record|date=25 July 2007}}</ref>

[[Sweden|Swedish]] forward [[Gunnar Nordahl]] scored 38 goals in the [[1950–51 Serie A|1950–51 season]], 35 of which were in Serie A, setting an [[Football in Italy|Italian football]] and club record. He went on to become Milan's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 221 goals for the club in 268 games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/milan.html|publisher=Channel4.com|title=AC Milan|date=25 July 2007}}</ref> He is followed in second place by [[Andriy Shevchenko]] with 175 goals in 322 games, and [[Gianni Rivera]] in third place, who has scored 164 goals in 658 games. Rivera is also Milan's youngest ever goalscorer, scoring in a league match against Juventus at just 17 years.

Legendary tactician [[Nereo Rocco]], the first proponent of ''[[catenaccio]]'' in the country, was Milan's longest-serving head coach, sitting on the bench for over nine years (in two spells) in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning the club's first European Cup triumphs. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who purchased the club in 1986, is Milan's longest-serving president (23 years, due to a two-year vacancy between 2004 and 2006).

The first official match in which Milan participated was in the [[Italian Football Championship 1900|Third Federal Football Championship]], the predecessor of Serie A, losing 3–0 to [[F.B.C. Torinese|Torinese]]. Milan's largest ever victory was 13–0 against [[Modena F.C.|Audax Modena]], in a league match at the 1914–15 season. Its heaviest defeat was recorded in the league at the 1922–23 season, beaten 0–8 by [[Bologna F.C. 1909|Bologna]].

During the [[1991–92 Serie A|1991–92 season]], the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only [[A.C. Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season ([[1978–79 Serie A|1978–79]]), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0–0 draw against [[S.S.D.
