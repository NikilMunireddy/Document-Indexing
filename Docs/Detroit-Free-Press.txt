The '''''Detroit Free Press''''' is the largest daily [[newspaper]] in [[Detroit, Michigan]], USA. The Sunday edition is entitled the '''''Sunday Free Press'''''.

It primarily serves [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne]], [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland]], [[Macomb County|Macomb]], [[Livingston County, Michigan|Livingston]], [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw]], and [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe]] counties.

The ''Free Press'' is also the largest city newspaper owned by [[Gannett]], which also publishes ''[[USA Today]]''.

==History==

===1831–1987: Competitive newspaper===
The newspaper was first published as the ''Democratic Free Press and Michigan Intelligencer'' May 5, 1831. The first issues were printed on a Washington press purchased from the discontinued ''Oakland Chronicle'' of [[Pontiac, Michigan]]. It was hauled from Pontiac in a wagon over rough roads to a building at Bates and Woodbridge streets in Detroit. The press could produce 250 pages an hour, hand operated by two men. The first issues were {{convert|14|x|20|in|mm}} in size, with five columns of type. Sheldon McKnight became the first publisher with John Pitts Sheldon as editor.

In the 1850s, the paper was developed into a leading [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] publication under the ownership of [[Wilbur F. Storey]].  Storey left for the ''[[Chicago Times]]'' in 1861, taking a lot of the staff with him.<ref>{{Cite DAB |title=Storey, Wilbur Fisk |year=1936 |author=Willard Grosvenor Bleyer}}</ref> In the 1870s ownership passed to [[William E. Quinby]], who continued its Democratic leanings and established a [[London, England]] edition.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Detroit Historical Society |url=http://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/detroit-free-press |title=Detroit Free Press |year=2012}}</ref>

In 1940, the Knight Newspapers (later [[Knight Ridder]]) purchased the ''Free Press''.  During the following 47 years the ''Free Press'' competed with ''[[The Detroit News]]'', and the ''[[Detroit Times]]''—until it ceased publication in November 1960, in the southeastern Michigan market. The ''Free Press'' was delivered and sold as a morning paper while the ''News'' was sold and delivered as an evening newspaper.

===1987–present: Joint operating agreement===
In 1987, the paper entered into a one hundred-year [[joint operating agreement]] with its rival, combining business operations while maintaining separate editorial staffs. The combined company is called the [[Detroit Media Partnership]]. The two papers also began to publish joint Saturday and Sunday editions, though the editorial content of each remained separate. At the time, the ''Detroit Free Press'' was the tenth highest circulation paper in the United States, and the combined ''Detroit News and Free Press'' was the country's fourth largest Sunday paper.

July 13, 1995, [[Newspaper Guild]]-represented employees of the ''Free Press'' and ''News'' and the pressmen, printers and Teamsters working for the "Detroit Newspapers" distribution arm [[Detroit newspaper strike of 1995–97|went on strike]]. By October, about 40% of the editorial staffers had crossed the picket line, and many trickled back over the next months while others stayed out for the two and a half years of the strike. The strike was resolved in court three years later, and the unions remain active at the paper, representing a majority of the employees under their jurisdiction.

[[File:News Free Press Building.JPG|thumb|''Free Press'' offices 1998–2014]]
In 1998, the ''Free Press'' vacated its [[Detroit Free Press Building|former headquarters]] in downtown Detroit and moved to offices into the ''News'' building.

August 3, 2005, Knight Ridder sold the ''Free Press'' to the [[Gannett]] company, which had previously owned and operated the ''News''.  The ''News'', in turn, was sold to [[MediaNews Group]]; Gannett continues to be the managing partner in the papers' joint operating agreement.

The ''Free Press'' resumed publication of its own Sunday edition, May 7, 2006, without any content from the ''News.'' A quirk in the operating agreement, however, allows the ''News'' to continue printing its editorial page in the Sunday ''Free Press.''

[[File:FederalReserveBankDetroit.jpg|thumb|left|Home of the ''Detroit Free Press'' and ''Detroit News'' offices since October 2014]]December 16, 2008, Detroit Media Partnership (DMP) announced a plan to limit weekday home delivery for both dailies to Thursday and Friday only. On other weekdays the paper sold at newsstands would be smaller, about 32 pages, and redesigned. This arrangement went into effect March 30, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/31/business/media/31paper.html?_r=1 |author=Richard Pérez-Peña & Mary Chapman |title=Detroit's Daily Papers Are Now Not So Daily |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=nytimes.com |date=March 31, 2009 |accessdate=March 4, 2011}}</ref>

The ''Free Press'' entered a news partnership with [[CBS]] [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WWJ-TV]] channel 62 in March 2009 to produce a morning news show called ''First Forecast Mornings''. Prior to the partnership, WWJ aired absolutely no local newscast at all.<ref>{{cite news |last=Marcucci |first=Carl |title=Free Press will join WWJ-TV for reports |url=http://rbr.com/free-press-will-join-wwj-tv-for-reports/ |accessdate=June 22, 2012 |newspaper=RBR.com |date=March 29, 2009}}</ref>

In February 2014, the DMP announced its offices along with those of the ''Free Press'' and ''The Detroit News'' would occupy six floors in both the old and new sections of the former [[Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch Building|Federal Reserve building]] at 160 West Fort Street. The partnership expected to place signs on the exterior similar to those on the former offices.<ref name=move>{{cite web| title=Free Press, News moving to new home in core of downtown Detroit| url=http://www.freep.com/article/20140219/BUSINESS06/302190176/detroit-free-press-building-moves-federal-reserve| last1=Zaniewski| first1=Ann| last2=Gallagher| first2=John| work=Detroit Free Press| date=February 20, 2014| accessdate=May 16, 2014}}</ref><ref name=aguilar>{{cite news| title=Detroit News, Free Press, DMP will occupy 6 floors in old Federal Reserve building| url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20140423/BIZ03/304230078| last=Aguilar| first=Louis| work=The Detroit News| date=April 23, 2014| accessdate=May 16, 2014}}</ref>  The move took place October 24–27, 2014.<ref name=Rubin>{{cite news| title=News moving out, leaving century of memories behind| url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/neal-rubin/2014/10/23/rubin-detroit-news-memories/17817013/| last=Rubin| first=Neil| date=October 24, 2014| work=[[Detroit News]]| accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref>
