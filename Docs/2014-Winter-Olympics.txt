The '''2014 Winter Olympics''', officially called the '''XXII Olympic Winter Games''' ({{lang-fr|Les XXIIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver|links=no}}) ({{lang-rus|XXII Олимпийские зимние игры|r=XXII Olimpiyskiye zimniye igry|links=no}}) and commonly known as '''Sochi 2014''', were a major international [[multi-sport event]] held from February 7 to February 23, 2014 in [[Sochi]], [[Krasnodar Krai]], Russia, with opening rounds in certain events held on the eve of the [[2014 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]], 6 February 2014. Both the Olympics and [[2014 Winter Paralympics]] were organized by the [[Sochi 2014 Olympic and Paralympic Organizing Committee|Sochi Organizing Committee]] (SOOC). Sochi was selected as the host city in July 2007, during the 119th IOC Session held in [[Guatemala City]]. It was the first Olympics in Russia since the breakup of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. The Soviet Union was the host nation for the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]].

A total of 98 events in 15 winter sport disciplines were held during the Games. A number of new competitions—a total of 12 accounting for gender—were held during the Games, including [[biathlon]] mixed relay, women's [[ski jumping]], mixed-team [[figure skating]], mixed-team [[luge]], [[half-pipe]] skiing, ski and snowboard [[slopestyle]], and snowboard [[parallel slalom]]. The events were held around two clusters of new venues: an Olympic Park constructed in Sochi's [[Imeretinsky Valley]] on the coast of the [[Black Sea]], with [[Fisht Olympic Stadium]], and the Games' indoor venues located within walking distance, and snow events in the [[resort town|resort settlement]] of [[Krasnaya Polyana, Sochi, Krasnodar Krai|Krasnaya Polyana]].

In preparation, organizers focused on modernizing the [[Telecommunications in Russia|telecommunications]], [[Electricity sector in Russia|electric power]], and [[Transport in Russia|transportation]] infrastructures of the region. While originally budgeted at US$12 billion, various factors caused the budget to expand to over US$51 billion, surpassing the estimated $44 billion cost of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing as the most expensive Olympics in history.

The lead-up to these Games was marked by several major controversies, including allegations that corruption among officials led to the aforementioned [[cost overrun]]s, concerns for the safety of [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) athletes and spectators due to the effects of the [[Russian LGBT propaganda law]], protests by ethnic [[Circassians|Circassian]] activists over the site of Sochi (where they believe [[Circassian Genocide|a genocide]] took place in the 19th century), and threats by [[jihadist]] groups tied to the [[insurgency in the North Caucasus]]. However, following the [[2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]], commentators evaluated the Games to have been overall successful.<ref name="Sappenfield"/><ref name="Grohmann2014"/>

In the years following the Sochi Olympics, accusations were made that Russia presided over a state-run program which supplied their athletes with [[performance-enhancing drugs]]. It was alleged by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games.<ref name="nyt1">{{cite news |title=Russian Insider Says State-Run Doping Fueled Olympic Gold |authors= REBECCA R.

===Logo and branding===
The emblem of the 2014 Winter Olympics was unveiled in December 2009. While more elaborate designs with influence from [[Khokhloma]] were considered, organizers chose to use a more minimalistic and "futuristic" design instead, consisting only of [[typeface]]s with no drawn elements at all. The emblem was designed so that the "Sochi" and "2014" lettering would mirror each other vertically, "reflecting" the contrasts of Russia's landscape (such as Sochi itself, a meeting point between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Western Caucasus]]).<ref name=newyorker-emblem /> Critics, including Russian bloggers, panned the logo for being too simplistic and lacking any real symbolism; [[Guo Chunning]], designer of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] emblem ''[[Dancing Beijing]]'', criticized it for its lack of detail, and believed it should have contained more elements that represented winter and Russia's national identity, aside from its blue color scheme and its use of [[.ru]], the [[top-level domain]] of Russia.<ref name=newyorker-emblem>{{cite web|title=Behind Sochi's Futuristic Logo|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/currency/2014/02/sochi-and-olympic-logos.html|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=4 February 2014}}</ref>

The Games' official slogan, ''Hot. Cool. Yours.'' (''Жаркие. Зимние. Твои.''), was unveiled on 25 September 2012, 500 days before the opening ceremony. Presenting the slogan, SOC president Dmitry Chernyshenko explained that it represented the "passion" and heated competition of the Games' athletes, the contrasting climate of Sochi, and a sense of inclusion and belonging.<ref name=usatoday-slogan>{{cite news|title=Sochi releases Olympic slogan that is neither hot, nor cool|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2012/09/25/sochi-olympic-slogan-hot-cool-yours/1592155/|work=USA Today|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=25 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=csm-hotcooly>{{cite web|title='Hot.Cool.Yours.'

For the first time in Olympic history, a public vote was held to decide the mascots for the 2014 Winter Olympics; the 10 finalists, along with the results, were unveiled during live specials on [[Channel One Russia|Channel One]]. On 26 February 2011, the official mascots were unveiled, consisting of a [[polar bear]], a [[Mountain hare|snow hare]], and a [[snow leopard]]. The initial rounds consisted of online voting among submissions, while the final round involved text messaging.<ref name=inside-mascotvote>{{cite web|title=Russian public to vote for Sochi 2014 mascot|url=http://insidethegames.biz/winter-olympics/2014/11887-russian-public-to-vote-for-sochi-2014-mascot|work=InsideTheGames.biz|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=insidethegames-decided>{{cite web|title=Sochi 2014 chooses three mascots for Olympics as Father Christmas withdraws in row over property rights|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2014/12093-sochi-2014-chooses-mascots|work=InsideTheGames.biz|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=rt-zoichlose/>

A satirical mascot known as [[Zoich]] (its name being an interpretation of the stylized "2014" lettering from the Games' emblem as a [[cyrillic script|cyrillic]] word), a fuzzy blue frog with hypnotic multi-coloured rings (sharing the colors of the [[Olympic rings]]) on his eyeballs and the [[Imperial Crown of Russia|Imperial Crown]] ("to remind about statehood and spirituality"), proved popular in initial rounds of online voting, and became a local [[internet meme]] among Russians, with some comparing it to ''[[Futurama]]''{{'}}s "[[Hypnotoad]]". Despite its popularity, Zoich did not qualify for the final round of voting, with its creator, political cartoonist Egor Zhgun, claiming that organizers were refusing to respect public opinion. However, it was later revealed that Zoich was [[Guerrilla marketing|deliberately planted]] by organizers to help virally promote the online mascot vote.<ref name=rt-zoichlose>{{cite web|title=Mock mascot loses Olympic race, wins bloggers' hearts|url=http://rt.com/news/mascot-olympic-zoich-zhgun/|work=Russia Today|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=rt-zoich>{{cite web|title=Mock mascot Zoich masterminded by Sochi 2014 organizers|url=http://rt.com/sport/mock-mascot-zoich-sochi-2014/|work=Russia Today|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref>

The Olympic infrastructure was constructed according to a Federal Target Program (FTP). In June 2009, the Games' organizers reported they were one year ahead in building the main Olympic facilities as compared to recent Olympic Games.<ref>[http://itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=14095344&PageNum=11 Russia prepares for Olympic Games 2014 faster than scheduled] ITAR-TASS, 27 June 2009 {{wayback|url=http://itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=14095344&PageNum=11 |date=20110611040556 |df=y }}</ref> In November 2011, [[IOC]] President [[Jacques Rogge]] was in Sochi and concluded that the city had made significant progress since he last visited eighteen months earlier.<ref>[http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/other_news/1216135972.html IOC Head Praises Sochi 2014] GamesBids.com, 24 November 2011</ref>

===Telecommunications===
{{see also|Telecommunications in Russia}}

According to the FTP, US$580&nbsp;million would be spent on construction and modernization of telecommunications in the region. [[Avaya]] was named by the Sochi Organizing Committee as the official supplier of telecommunications equipment. Avaya provided the data network equipment, including [[switch]]es, [[Router (computing)|routers]], security, telephones and [[Call centre|contact-center systems]]. It provided engineers and technicians to design and test the systems, and worked with other technology partners to provide athletes, dignitaries and fans information about the Games.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bing Ads |url=http://www.slideshare.net/AvayaInc/dn7191-en-sochi |title=Avaya Official supplyer of network equipment |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=23 April 2013 |accessdate=9 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131202225957/http://www.slideshare.net/AvayaInc/dn7191-en-sochi |archivedate=2 December 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethegames.biz/olympics/winter-olympics/2014/15030-us-firm-avaya-named-as-sochi-2014-network-equipment-supplier|title=US firm Avaya named as Sochi 2014 network equipment supplier|publisher=Insidethegames.biz|date=30 November 2011|accessdate=17 January 2014}}</ref>

Infrastructure built for the games included:
* A network of [[TETRA]] mobile radio communications for 100 user groups (with capacity of 10,000 subscribers);
* {{Convert|712|km|abbr=on}} of [[fiber-optic communication|fiber-optic cables]] along the [[Anapa]]-[[Dzhubga]]-[[Sochi]] highways and Dzhubga–[[Krasnodar]] branch;
* [[Digital television in Russia|Digital broadcasting]] infrastructure, including radio and television [[Television station|broadcasting stations]] (building and [[communications tower]]s) with coverage from Grushevaya Polyana (''Pear Glade'') to Sochi and Anapa cities. The project also included construction of infocommunications centre for broadcasting abroad via three [[HDTV]] [[satellite]]s.

During the Games, the [[core network]]s of [[Rostelecom]] and [[Transtelekom]] were used.<ref>[http://www.osp.ru/nets/2007/10/4275795/ "Сочи-2014 выходит на связь"]. Открытые системы, 2007 {{ru icon}}</ref>

In January 2012, the newest equipment for the television coverage of the Games arrived in the port of [[Adler Microdistrict|Adler]]. Prepared specifically for the Games, a team of regional specialists and the latest technology provide a qualitatively new level of television production in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcasting.ru/articles2/event/innovacionnoe-olimpiiskoe-televizionnoe-oborydovanie-vpervie-v-sochi|title=Инновационное олимпийское телевизионное оборудование впервые в Сочи|publisher=Broadcasting.ru|date=|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>

The fiber-optic channel links Sochi between [[Adlersky City District|Adler]] and Krasnaya Polyana. The {{convert|46|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} channel enables videoconferencing and news reporting from the Olympics.<ref>[http://www.radiomayak.ru/doc.html?id=67646 Fiber-optic communications in Olympic Sochi] Mayak Radio, 28 March 2008 {{ru icon}} {{wayback|url=http://www.radiomayak.ru/doc.html?id=67646 |date=20080415073350 |df=y }}</ref>

In November 2013, it was reported that the fiber-optic cable that was built by the [[Russian Federal Communications Agency|Federal Communications Agency]], Rossvyaz, had no operator. With Rostelecom and Megafon both refusing to operate it, the line was transferred to the ownership of the state enterprise Center for Monitoring & Development of Infocommunication Technologies ({{lang-ru|link=no|Центр МИР ИТ}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comnews.ru/node/77741|title='МИР ИТ' приютил олимпийскую ВОЛС|work=comnews.ru|accessdate= 17 November 2013}}</ref>

Russian mobile phone operator [[Megafon]] expanded and improved Sochi's telecom infrastructure with over 700 new 2G/3G/4G cell towers. Sochi was the first Games to offer [[Long term evolution|4G connectivity]] at a speed of 10&nbsp;MB/sec.

In January 2014, Rostelecom reported that it had connected the Olympic media center in Sochi to the Internet and organized channels of communication with the main media center of the Olympic Games in the coastal cluster and press center in Moscow. The media center was built at total cost of 17 million rubles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasstelecom.ru/news/one/27225|title="Ростелеком" обеспечил телекоммуникационными услугами олимпийский медиацентр в Сочи|work=TASS-TELECOM|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/non-political/716037|title=Olympics' press center and Mountain Cluster's media center open in Sochi|work=ITAR-TASS|date=24 January 2014|accessdate= 24 January 2014}}</ref>

===Power infrastructure===
[[File:NASA Night View of Sochi During Olympics.jpg|thumb|Night view of Sochi during the Olympics, taken by Expedition 38 members from the [[International Space Station]]]]

A five-year strategy for increasing the power supply of the Sochi region was presented by Russian energy experts during a seminar on 29 May 2009, held by the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee, and attended by International Olympic Committee (IOC) experts and officials from the [[Russian Ministry of Regional Development]], the [[Russian Ministry of Energy]], the State Corporation Olimpstroy and the Krasnodar Krai administration.<ref name=energy2>[http://www.sochi2014.com/en/news-games-2014-will-double-sochi-power-supply Games 2014 Will Double Sochi Power Supply] Sochi 2014, 29 May 2009</ref>

According to the strategy, the capacity of the regional energy network would increase by two and a half times by 2014, guaranteeing a stable power supply during and after the Games.

The power demand of Sochi in the end of May 2009 was 424 MW. The power demand of the Olympic infrastructure was expected to be about 340 MW.
* Poselkovaya [[electrical substation]] became operational in early 2009.
* Sochi [[thermal power station]] reconstructed (expected power output was 160 MW)
* Laura and Rosa Khutor electrical substations were completed in November 2010
* Mzymta electrical substation was completed in March 2011
* Krasnopolyanskaya [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[power station]] was completed in 2010
* Adler [[Combined heat and power|CHP]] station design and construction was completed in 2012. Expected power output was 360 MW<ref>[http://www.gazprom.com/press/news/2009/september/article68506/ Gazprom launches construction of Adler CHPS] Gazprom, 28 September 2009</ref>
* Bytkha substation, under construction with two [[transformer]]s 25 MW each, includes dependable microprocessor-based protection

Earlier plans also include building [[combined cycle]] (steam and gas) power stations near the cities of [[Tuapse]] and [[Novorossiysk]] and construction of a cable-wire powerline, partially on the floor of the [[Black Sea]].<ref name=energy>[http://top.rbc.ru/economics/06/07/2007/108439.shtml The power capacities of the Sochi region will increase before the Olympics by a factor of four] RBC, 6 July 2007 {{ru icon}}</ref>

The torch was also passed for the first time in [[Outer space|space]], though not lit for the duration of the flight for safety reasons, on flight [[Soyuz TMA-11M]] to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The spacecraft itself was adorned with Olympic-themed [[livery]] including the Games' emblem.

The opening ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics was held on 7 February 2014 at [[Fisht Olympic Stadium]], an indoor arena built specifically for the ceremonies. The ceremony featured scenes based around aspects of Russian history and arts, including [[ballet]], [[classical music]], the [[Russian Revolution]], and the age of the [[Soviet Union]]. The opening scene of the ceremony featured a notable technical error, where one of five snowflakes, which were to expand to form the Olympic rings, malfunctioned and did not expand (a mishap mocked by the organizers at the closing ceremony where one of the roundrelay dance groups symbolizing the Olympic rings "failed" to expand). The torch was taken into the stadium by [[Maria Sharapova]], who then passed it to [[Yelena Isinbayeva]] who, in turn, passed it to wrestler [[Aleksandr Karelin]]. Karelin then passed the torch to gymnast [[Alina Kabaeva]]. Figure skater [[Irina Rodnina]] took the torch and was met by former ice hockey goalkeeper [[Vladislav Tretiak]], who exited the stadium to jointly light the Olympic cauldron located near the centre of Olympic Park.<ref name=CNN-oc14>{{cite news|title=Sochi 2014 begins with teams, classical music and a flying girl|author=Faith Karimi|author2=Michael Martinez|publisher=CNN|date=7 February 2014|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/07/world/europe/russia-sochi-winter-olympics/|accessdate=7 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=WashPost-oc14>{{cite news|title=Olympics open in Sochi with extravagant pageant|date=7 February 2014|work=Washington Post|author= Kathy Lally|author2=Will Englund|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/olympics-open-in-sochi-with-extravagant-pageant/2014/02/07/bba8a5e2-9011-11e3-b227-12a45d109e03_story.html|accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref>

===Incidents and threats===
Organizers received several threats prior to the Games. In a July 2013 video release, [[Chechen people|Chechen]] [[Islamism|Islamist]] commander [[Dokka Umarov]] called for attacks on the Games, stating that the Games were being staged "[[Ethnic cleansing of Circassians|on the bones of many, many Muslims killed]] ...and buried on our lands extending to the Black Sea."<ref name=rferl-caucasusthreat>{{cite web|title=Caucasus Emirate Leader Calls On Insurgents To Thwart Sochi Winter Olympics|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/sochi-olympics-terrorism-umarov/25035408.html|work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|accessdate=13 February 2014}}</ref>

Threats were received from the group [[Vilayat Dagestan]], which had claimed responsibility for the [[Volgograd bombings]] under the demands of Umarov, and a number of National Olympic Committees had also received threats via e-mail, threatening that terrorists would kidnap or "blow up" athletes during the Games. However, while the IOC did state that the letters "[contained] no threat and appears to be a random message from a member of the public", the U.S. ski and snowboarding teams hired a private security agency to provide additional protection during the Games.<ref name="themoscowtimes.com"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/winter-olympics/10590826/Winter-Olympics-2014-email-threat-to-blow-up-athletes-at-Sochi-Games-dismissed-by-IOC.html|title=Winter Olympics 2014: email threat to 'blow up' athletes at Sochi Games dismissed by IOC|work=Telegraph|date=22 January 2014|accessdate=30 January 2014|location=London|first=Ben|last=Rumsby}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/sochi2014/20140122/186809712.html |title=European Olympic Committees Report Sochi Terror Threats |publisher=En.ria.ru |date=2014-01-22 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref>

==Media==

===Broadcasting rights===
{{main|List of 2014 Winter Olympics broadcasters}}

In most regions, broadcast rights to the 2014 Winter Olympics were packaged together with broadcast rights for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but some broadcasters obtained rights to further games as well. Domestic broadcast rights were sold by [[Sportfive]] to a consortium of three Russian broadcasters; [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]], [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company|VGTRK]], and [[NTV Plus]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Love|first=Tom|title=Sportfive concludes Olympic agreement in Russia|url=http://sportspromedia.com/news/sportfive_concludes_olympic_agreement_in_russia/|accessdate=4 September 2012|work=SportsPro|date=3 September 2012}}</ref>

In the United States, the 2014 Winter Olympics were the first in a new, US$4.38 billion contract with [[NBC]], extending its broadcast rights to the Olympic Games through 2020.<ref name=bandc-nbc2014>{{cite web|title=Lazarus: We Believe Sochi Olympics Will Be Profitable|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/491704-Lazarus_We_Believe_Sochi_Olympics_Will_Be_Profitable.php|work=Broadcasting & Cable|accessdate=13 August 2013}}</ref>

In Canada, after losing the 2010 and 2012 Games to [[Bell Media]] and [[Rogers Media]], the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] re-gained broadcast rights to the Olympics for the first time since 2008, gaining rights to the 2014 and 2016 Games.

===Filming===
Several broadcasters used the Games to trial the emerging [[ultra high definition television]] (UHDTV) standard. Both [[NTV Plus]] and [[Comcast]] filmed portions of the Games in [[4K resolution]]; Comcast offered its content through [[smart TV]] apps, while NTV+ held public and cinema viewings of the content. [[NHK]] filmed portions of the Games in [[8K resolution]] for public viewing.

The lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics were affected by numerous controversies and concerns.

The Games also became notable for their severe cost overruns, which made them the most expensive Winter Olympics in history; Russian politician [[Boris Nemtsov]] cited allegations of corruption among government officials as a cause of the overruns, concluding that the Games were "nothing but a monstrous scam."<ref>{{cite news|last=Bennetts|first=Marc|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/vladimir-putin/10581829/Sochi-Olympics-Nothing-but-a-monstrous-scam-says-Kremlin-critic.html|title=Winter Olympics 2014: Sochi Games "nothing but a monstrous scam," says Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov|work=Telegraph|date=19 January 2014|accessdate=4 February 2014|location=London}}</ref> Allison Stewart of the [[Saïd Business School]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], noted that relations between the government and construction companies were closer in Sochi than at other games.<ref name=sochi>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21581764-most-expensive-olympic-games-history-offer-rich-pickings-select-few-castles|title=The Sochi Olympics: Castles in the sand|work=The Economist|date=13 July 2013|accessdate=8 August 2013}}</ref> In a press conference, IOC president [[Thomas Bach]] defended the high costs of the Games, stating that the costs were in line with previous Olympics, but that the additional costs were a "long-term investment" into making Sochi a year-round destination.<ref name="bach1">{{cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/bach-39-am-still-assured-39-security-sochi-124516218.html|title=Bach: 'I am still assured' of security in Sochi|date=3 February 2014|accessdate=11 February 2014|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> The quality and availability of accommodations in Sochi were affected by missed contractor deadlines and inclement weather. On the final weekend before the start of the Games, only six of the nine hotels for accredited members of the media had been completed. In the other three, journalists reported various issues, including rooms that were unclean, no working water, discoloured tap water, and missing furniture or amenities. Executive Director Gilbert Felli stated that the rooms would be finished by 5 February, while Deputy Prime Minister [[Dmitry Kozak]] noted that the media hotels just needed a "final cleaning".<ref name="accommodation"/><ref name=nydn-sochirooms>{{cite news|title=From Sochi, journalists report Winter Olympics woes: poor conditions and ongoing construction|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/olympics/media-reports-sochiproblems-olympic-village-article-1.1602530|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=8 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=ap-hoteldelay>{{cite news|title=Sochi Olympics: Hotel delays aren't affecting athletes, IOC official says|url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/sochi2014/2014/02/03/sochi_olympics_hotel_delays_arent_affecting_athletes_ioc_official_says.html|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=8 February 2014|location=Toronto|work=The Star|date=3 February 2014}}</ref><ref name=torstar-worsthotel>{{cite news|title=Sochi 2014 Olympics: 'Worst.

===Allegations of doping===

In May 2016, ''[[The New York Times]]'' printed allegations that Russia organized a state-run doping program which supplied their athletes with [[performance-enhancing drugs]] during the 2014 Winter Olympics. The allegations were made by Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory at Sochi, who was previously named in a [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] investigation into Russian doping in November 2015.
