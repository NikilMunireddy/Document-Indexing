'''Crawley Town Football Club''' is a professional [[association football]] club based in the town of [[Crawley]], [[West Sussex]], England. The team play in [[Football League Two|League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]]. The club's home ground is at [[Broadfield Stadium]]. First promoted to the [[Football Conference]] in 2004, the club survived a financial crisis to win promotion to the [[Football League]] in the 2010–11 season. In the same year they reached the 5th round of the [[FA Cup]], where they lost to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] 1–0.

==History==
===Early years===
Formed in 1896, Crawley Town became founding members of the [[West Sussex Football League]] that year, joining the Junior Division.<ref name="wessussex">{{cite web|url=http://www.shorehambysea.com/shoreham-fc-the-glory-years.html |title=Shoreham F.C.&nbsp;– Early football in Shoreham and the 'Glory Years |publisher=Shoreham History Portal |date= |accessdate=16 April 2013}}</ref> They remained in the West Sussex league for five years before transferring to the [[Mid-Sussex Football League|Mid-Sussex League]], winning the League in only their second season

They stayed at this level until they entered the Sussex County League in 1951 before switching again five years later to the [[Metropolitan League]], which was a competition for both professional and amateur sides. Crawley retained their amateur status and went on to win the Metropolitan League Challenge Cup in 1959.

Crawley turned semi-professional in 1962 and the following year they joined Division One of the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. In 1969 they were promoted to Premier Division of the Southern League but the joy was short lived as the following season they were relegated back to the first division where they remained until the 1983–84 season when they were promoted as runners-up.<ref name="crawleytownfc.com">http://www.crawleytownfc.com/page/History/0,,11025~2410209,00.html</ref>

The club have enjoyed many cup successes, winning the Sussex Professional Cup in 1970, the Gilbert Rice Floodlight Cup in 1980 and 1984, the Southern Counties Combination Floodlight Cup in 1986, and the Sussex Senior Cup in 1990 and 1991. The Sussex Floodlight Cup was won in three consecutive years from 1991 to 1993 and also again in 1998–99.<ref name="crawleytownfc.com" />

Despite several cup successes, Crawley's most successful cup run at the time was in the 1991–92 season when they reached [[The FA Cup]] third round proper and played local rivals [[Brighton]], losing 5–0 in front of 18,301 at the [[Goldstone Ground]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sussexcountyfc.milbint.com/Directory/Crawley%20Town/Crawley%20Town.html |title=Crawley Town FC |publisher=Sussexcountyfc.milbint.com |date= |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref>

In 2004 The Red Devils signed off their 20-season stay in the Premier Division of the Southern League by wrapping up the championship in convincing style, ending up 12 points clear of the field and adding their second successive League Cup success and the league's Championship Match trophy. The title was wrapped up with four matches remaining, as a 3–0 victory at [[Welling United]] sparked emotional celebrations from a large travelling contingent. Crawley would now be playing in the [[Football Conference]], the highest level of non-League football, for the first time in their history.

===Conference===
A final position of 12th in their first season in the National Division was an amazing achievement for the club who finished as the highest ranked part-time team in the country. Crawley also retained the Sussex Senior Cup by defeating Ringmer.

In 2005 the SA Group bought the club and made the decision to go full-time for the first time in the club's history. Although this was necessary in order to allow them to compete in the division,<ref>{{cite web|author=Published on Tue Jul 26 18:03:37 BST 2005 |url=http://www.crawleyobserver.co.uk/sport/NEW-OWNERS-REVEAL-PLANS.1096139.jp |title=NEW OWNERS REVEAL PLANS&nbsp;– Sport Video highlights |publisher=Crawley Observer |date= |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> it led to the departure of several key players, including fans' favourite [[Charlie MacDonald]] and goalkeeper Andy Little, who were unable to give up their day jobs to play full-time.

The 2005–06 season didn't start well for Crawley as the club found themselves third from bottom and out of the FA Cup after a shock defeat to [[Braintree Town F.C.|Braintree Town]]. Francis Vines was subsequently sacked and replaced by former [[Chelsea FC]] manager and player [[John Hollins]] and his assistant Alan Lewer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crawley_town/4372112.stm | work=BBC News | title=Lowly Crawley sack manager Vines | date=24 October 2005}}</ref> Things got worse for Crawley and as attendances dropped so too did the club's income; the club's owners were forced to slash the players' and staff wages by 50% due to lack of funds. Several key players left the club, including captain [[Ian Simpemba]], [[Simon Wormull]] and record signing [[Daryl Clare]]; it looked certain that relegation was on the cards.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crawley_town/4779696.stm | work=BBC News | title=Crawley squad have wages slashed | date=6 March 2006 | accessdate=30 April 2010 | first=Pete | last=Oliver}}</ref> However five straight wins through March and April saw the club climb the table to 17th place and remarkably beat the drop by 10 points. The club were docked three points at the end of the season for breaching the annual playing budget but this had no effect on the final standings and Crawley's league status was safe but they later went into [[Administration (law)|administration]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crawley_town/5041350.stm | work=BBC News | title=Crawley placed in administration | date=5 June 2006}}</ref>

In August 2006 it was announced that the club would fold because of its debts, and it came within an hour of the [[liquidation]] deadline. However, a last-minute rescue package saved the club and allowed it to carry on playing, albeit with a 10-point deduction for entering administration.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/gallery/2011/apr/10/crawley-town-promotion | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Crawley Town (football),Football,Sport | date=12 April 2011}}</ref>

Crawley started the 2006–07 season by winning their opening three games and all but wiped out their 10-point deduction. The following month, however, the club's form dipped and this led to John Hollins and Alan Lewer losing their jobs. The news did not go down well with the fans as the pair had stuck with Crawley when others decided to leave and they had managed to lift the club off the bottom despite a 10-point deduction. They were replaced by players Ben Judge and [[David Woozley]] with the help of John Yems, the former [[Fulham FC]] and [[Millwall FC]] coach.<ref>{{cite web|author=Published on Monday 30 October 2006 12:47 |url=http://www.crawleyobserver.co.uk/sport/reds_sack_hollins_and_lewer_1_972364 |title=Reds Sack Hollins And Lewer&nbsp;– News |publisher=Crawley Observer |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> Life started well for the trio who picked up 10 points from a possible 12. Crawley finished 18th in the division and managed to beat the drop after securing the point they needed on the final day of the season.

For the start of the 2007–08 season a new regime was put into place which included Victor Marley as club Chairman and [[Steve Evans (footballer born 1962)|Steve Evans]] as manager, with Paul Raynor as assistant. The season didn't get off to the best of starts as the club was docked six points due to their financial standing. Crawley finished the season in a respectable 15th place, and were runners-up in the Sussex Senior Cup, despite the club's financial position and points deduction.

In April 2008 Prospect Estate Holdings Limited took control of Crawley after buying it from the SA Group in conjunction with former owner John Duly. The club's financial worries were over and the club could look to build again and start the 2008–09 season on a level playing field.

===FA Cup run & Football League===
In 2010 Bruce Winfield announced that he and Susan Carter had become majority shareholders and had attracted new investment for the club, some of which came from overseas.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/fa-cup/8289230/Crawley-Towns-owner-Bruce-Winfield-on-his-lifelong-passion-for-the-club-others-love-to-hate.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Ian | last=Chadband | title=Crawley Town's owner, Bruce Winfield, on his lifelong passion for the club others love to hate | date=28 January 2011}}</ref> The investment allowed manager Steve Evans to start rebuilding the squad, which saw 23 players signed over a six-month period including [[Matt Tubbs]], for £70,000<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crawley_town/8779734.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tubbs completes Crawley transfer | date=1 July 2010}}</ref> [[Sergio Torres]] for a record £100,000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissussex.co.uk/sport/Town-smash-transfer-record-land-Torres/article-2398947-detail/article.html |title=CRAWLEY Town have broken their transfer fee record for the second time in a month after securing the signature of winger Sergio Raul Torres. |publisher=This is Sussex |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> and [[Richard Brodie (footballer)|Richard Brodie]] for an undisclosed fee,<ref name="Crawley land York striker Brodie">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crawley_town/8959936.stm | work=BBC News | title=Crawley land York striker Brodie | date=1 September 2010}}</ref> the fee paid is estimated at a new Conference record of £275,000.

The investment paid off as Crawley were challenging for promotion to the Football League and embarked on a remarkable [[F.A Cup]] run having beaten [[Football League Championship|Championship]] side [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] 2–1 in the third round, followed by a 1–0 win at [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/9379079.stm | work=BBC News | title=Torquay 0–1 Crawley Town | date=29 January 2011}}</ref> in the fourth round and setting up a dream tie at [[Old Trafford]] to face [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the fifth round.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3380565/FA-Cup-draw-of-the-century-as-Crawley-Town-draw-Manchester-United.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Dan | last=Sales | title=Red Devils v Red Devils | date=31 January 2011}}</ref> Crawley lost the game 1–0 in front of 9,000 Crawley fans and were denied a draw in the 93rd minute when Richard Brodie's header hit the bar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Article/201009115937060 |title=FA Cup: Crawley Town Lose 1–0 To Man U |publisher=News.sky.com |date= |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref>

Crawley's cup run and the death of owner Bruce Winfield<ref>{{cite web|last=Talbot |first=Bruce |url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/sport/8922967.Crawley_Town_in_mourning_after_Bruce_Winfield_dies/ |title=Crawley Town in mourning after Bruce Winfield dies (From The Argus) |publisher=Theargus.co.uk |date=21 March 2011 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> didn't halt their progress in the league as just 19 days after Winfield's death Crawley secured the Conference title by beating [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] 3–0 and reaching the Football League for the first time in the club's history.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/football-league-blog/2011/apr/11/crawley-town-promotion-tamworth | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jeremy | last=Alexander | title=Crawley dreams realised as they gain promotion to Football League&nbsp;– Jeremy Alexander | date=11 April 2011}}</ref>

They once again enjoyed success in the [[FA Cup]] which saw them beat [[Football League Championship|Championship]] teams [[Bristol City]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16371525 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;– Crawley Town 1–0 Bristol City |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=7 January 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> at home and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16664570 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;– Hull 0–1 Crawley Town |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=28 January 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> away both 1–0. They suffered a 2–0 defeat against [[Stoke City]] in the fifth round. This was Crawley's first match against Premier League opposition at the [[Broadfield Stadium]].

Crawley finished 2011 at the top of League Two; a positive start to their first campaign in league football. However, despite continued success in the FA Cup, form slipped. Between 17 December 2011, and 13 March 2012, Crawley won just two league games out of a possible 14. Many argued the sales of [[Matt Tubbs]] and [[Tyrone Barnett]] for £800,000<ref>{{cite web|author=GMT |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16794214 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;– AFC Bournemouth sign Crawley Town striker Matt Tubbs |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=30 January 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> and £1,100,000<ref>{{cite web|last=Swan |first=Peter |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17208106 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;– Tyrone Barnett out to justify record fee |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=29 February 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> respectively, as well as failing to reach a deal over [[Andy Drury]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenun24.co.uk/ipswich-town/andy_drury_still_has_a_future_at_ipswich_as_crawley_end_interest_1_1165382 |title=Andy Drury still has a future at Ipswich as Crawley end interest&nbsp;– Latest News&nbsp;– Green Un |publisher=Greenun24.co.uk |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> contributed to their dip in form.

On 9 April, it was announced that [[Steve Evans (footballer born 1962)|Steve Evans]] had parted company<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11750/7660930/Evans-takes-Rotherham-reins | work=Sky Sports}}</ref> with Crawley to take up a post at [[Rotherham United]]. Evans revealed "In my opinion, how far can I take Crawley Town? League One certainly, but beyond that I was not so sure". Evans had previously admitted frustration over the departures of Matt Tubbs and Tyrone Barnett. Assistant manager [[Paul Raynor]] also left the club with immediate effect.<ref>http://www.crawleytownfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,11025~2728287,00.html</ref>

On Saturday 5 May Crawley secured [[League One]] promotion, courtesy of a 67th minute Scott Neilson strike against [[Accrington Stanley F.C.|Accrington Stanley]].

It was announced on 12 May, that Crawley were in talks to appoint [[Sean O'Driscoll]] as their new manager. Under a tight budget at [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] he achieved promotion to the [[Football League Championship]] in his first full season. He was appointed as manager four days later. But, he left on 12 July, to become the new manager of [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], meaning that he never took charge of Crawley for a single game.

On 7 August 2012, Crawley appointed Bury F.C. manager [[Richie Barker (footballer born 1975)|Richie Barker]] as their new manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19165979 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;– Crawley Town appoint Bury's Richie Barker as new manager |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=7 August 2012 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref>

On Sunday 3 May 2015, Crawley were relegated to League Two, following a 1–2 defeat at home to Coventry City.

===Financial problems===
Although Crawley Town FC had been in administration in the late 1990s, trouble began in March 2006 when the club's players and staff were made to take a 50% pay cut and the entire squad was put up for sale; Crawley went into administration in June of that year.<ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /> It was revealed by local newspaper [[The Argus (Brighton)|the Argus]] several days later that the chairman Chas Majeed was an undischarged bankrupt and therefore banned from holding a high position within the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.theargus.co.uk/2006/3/10/208759.html |title=Crawley Town FC Chairman is bankrupt (From The Argus) |publisher=Archive.theargus.co.uk |date=10 March 2006 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> Majeed later resigned from his post but remained on in some capacity.

The Reds' fans started a "Red Card" campaign in order to remove Chas Majeed and his owner brother Azwar Majeed from the club. It was revealed that the club was around £1.1million in debt with nearly £400,000 due to [[HM Revenue and Customs]], and the Majeeds claimed they were owed £700,000 by the club. By July of that year the debts were closer to £1.4 million, including money owed to current and former staff, and an offer of 25p in the pound was rejected by the creditors. With [[HM Revenue and Customs]] unwilling to move on their demand and being the biggest creditor (the Majeeds were unable to vote on the matter despite being owed money), it looked unlikely that the club would be saved.

By August 2006, only one bid had come in for the club which was from the current owners; it was rejected by three to one; the administrators were therefore obliged to liquidate the club and it was announced that the club would fold later that day.<ref name="clubsincrisis.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsincrisis.com/Club_Detail.asp?Key=102 |title=Crawley Town |publisher=Clubs In Crisis |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> However, a couple of days later, in one final attempt to rescue the club, the creditors met again to decide on a final offer. The creditors were split and so the administrator voted in Crawley Town's favour, allowing them to start the new season. The creditors would meet 14 days later to decide on an offer of 50p in the pound. The club was told that if the offer was rejected then the club would fold there and then, and there would be no going back.<ref name="clubsincrisis.com" /> By September 2006 the club's debt was at £1.8 million making former/current players and staff the biggest creditors and giving hope that a rescue bid would be accepted. The offer of 50p in the pound was later accepted and Crawley Town were able to continue playing for now, though this didn't stop [[HM Revenue and Customs]] from trying to wind up the SAGroup (Majeed's company) over unpaid taxes.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/crawley_town/5295456.stm | work=BBC News | title=Crawley creditors back rescue bid | date=30 August 2006 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> Azwar Majeed was later jailed for tax fraud relating to his various other businesses.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/7988739.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ex-football boss jailed for fraud | date=7 April 2009 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref>

In May 2007, it was confirmed that all of Crawley Town's debts had been cleared. However, complications arose and as a result Crawley were given a six-point penalty for the new season and a transfer embargo was put in place because of financial irregularities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubsincrisis.com/crawley_town.html |title=Crawley Town |publisher=Clubs In Crisis |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> It is believed that Crawley failed to confirm to the league that the debts had been paid.

After a short period of stability, Crawley Town ended up in the High Court in London to face a winding-up order on 17 February 2010; again this was because of money being owed to HMRC. The hearing was adjourned until 17 March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=gebrey |url=http://www.thisissussex.co.uk/crawley/news/Crawley-Town-given-breathing-space-winding-order-adjourned/article-1841616-detail/article.html |title=Crawley Town given breathing space after winding up order is adjourned |publisher=Thisissussex.co.uk |date= |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref> The latest setback appeared to be the end of Crawley Town, as the club had very few assets to sell in order to satisfy the debt. However, the case was later dismissed by the High Court as the club proved the debt had been paid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballmanagement.wordpress.com/2010/03/17/crawley-town-and-farnborough-in-court-today/ |title=Crawley Town and Farnborough in court today " Football Management |publisher=Footballmanagement.wordpress.com |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref>

In a move that showed confidence in the new management, on 29 March 2010 Crawley Borough Council agreed to lease the Broadfield Stadium to Crawley Town F.C., and to help secure the long-term sustainability of the club.<ref>{{cite web|author=Published on Mon March 29 14:17:19 BST 2010 |url=http://www.crawleyobserver.co.uk/news/BREAKING-NEWS-Crawley-Town-FC.6188154.jp |title=BREAKING NEWS: Crawley Town FC to lease ground from council&nbsp;– Video News Reports |publisher=Crawley Observer |date= |accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref>

==Ground==
[[Image:BroadfieldStadium.jpg|thumb|right|Broadfield Stadium]]
Crawley Town FC spent 48 years at their Town Mead home until the land was sold to developers in 1997. The club then moved to the [[Broadfield Stadium]], about two miles across town. The stadium has a capacity of 5,996 people, and is owned by [[Crawley Borough Council]].

In January 2012 the application for the new 2,000-seater East Stand (and facilities including new turnstiles and [[Premier League]] standard flood lights) was accepted by [[Crawley Borough Council]].<ref>[http://www.crawleytownfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,11025~2573572,00.html]</ref> The upgrade is required to meet the League rules which require a minimum 5,000 capacity stadium. After just one week of construction, the new East Stand was completed on 2 April 2012, bringing the total capacity of the [[Broadfield Stadium]] to 5,500. Upon completion, Crawley's first game with the new stand was against League Two side Crewe Alexandra on 6 April.

The record attendance reached 5,880 on Saturday 5 January 2013 when Crawley Town hosted Reading in the FA Cup<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.readingchronicle.co.uk/sport/readingfc/articles/2013/01/05/65589-royals-through-to-fa-cup-fourth-round/ |title=Royals through to FA Cup fourth round |publisher=The Reading Chronicle |date=5 January 2013 |accessdate=20 January 2013}}</ref>

In August 2013 it was announced that the club had agreed a sponsorship deal with the online trades comparison company Checkatrade to rename the stadium as The Checkatrade.com Stadium. although it is still known as the Broadfield by many <ref>http://www.crawleytownfc.com/news/article/checkatrade.com-stadium-417951.aspx</ref>

==Rivalries==
Crawley Town supporters view [[AFC Wimbledon]] as their biggest rivals in a 2012 survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thechriswhitingshow.wordpress.com/2012/08/28/2012-football-rivalry-census-results/|title=2012-13 Football Rivalry Survey Results|work=The Chris Whiting Show}}</ref> This is partly due to their relatively close proximity, and partly due to their frequent meetings since 2009. The two sides did not play each other between 2012 and 2015 due to Crawley's promotion to League One. However Crawley's relegation during the [[2014–15 Football League One]] season means the two sides played each other on 15 August 2015 which the Dons won 2–1 after going a goal down.
