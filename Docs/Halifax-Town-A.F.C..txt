==History==

===Early years===
The club was formed on 24 May 1911 at the Saddle Hotel.<ref>[http://www.fsf.org.uk/ground-guide/stadiums/halifaxtown/the-shay/ Halifax Town at The FSF Ground Guide]  {{wayback|df=yes|url=http://www.fsf.org.uk/ground-guide/stadiums/halifaxtown/the-shay/ |date=20090414103418 }}</ref> It initially played in the Yorkshire Combination and the [[Midland Football League|Midland League]]. It was one of the founder members of [[Football League Third Division North]] in 1921, and remained in that division until restructuring in 1958, when it became a member of the [[Football League Third Division]]. Its highest league position prior to World War II was second in 1934–35.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/halifax-town/history/post-ww1 |title=Halifax Town : History 1918 to 1945 |publisher=Statto |accessdate=9 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121002014005/http://www.statto.com:80/football/teams/halifax-town/history/post-ww1 |archivedate=2 October 2012 }} </ref>

===1960s-1990s===
They finished one place off promotion from the [[Football League Third Division]] in 1971. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 1993 they were relegated to the [[Football Conference]].<ref name=fchd/>

===Conference===
The club found the Conference no easier than the fourth division. After several poor seasons with severe financial constraints, the club was demoralised as there seemed to be no way out. However, previous manager [[George Mulhall]] returned towards the end of the [[1996-97 in English football|1996&ndash;97]] and avoided relegation from the Conference. The next season Mulhall and [[Kieran O'Regan]] made a number of additions to the squad including [[Jamie Paterson (Scottish footballer)|Jamie Paterson]], Mark Bradshaw and [[Lee Brendan Martin|Lee Martin]] to put together a title-winning team. The Shaymen were crowned champions of the Conference and thus regained Football League status. Free scoring [[Geoff Horsfield]] was also the top scorer in the Conference that season, scoring 30 goals.<ref>Johnny Meynell, Halifax Town from Ball to Lillis, 1999 p145</ref>

===Back In the Football League===
[[Image:HalifaxTownAFC.gif|thumb|right|200px|Previous club badge]]
At the start of the 1998&ndash;99 season, manager [[George Mulhall]] chose to retire and O'Regan was promoted to manager. Striker and top scorer [[Geoff Horsfield]] only played ten games before he was sold to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for £300,000 in October 1998.<ref>Johnny Meynell, Halifax Town from Ball to Lillis, 1999, p148</ref>  Halifax made a strong start to their league campaign and were amongst the leaders until December, after which their results started to drop off and they slipped into mid-table. Although only three points off playoff positions, O'Regan was sacked as manager by Chairman Jim Bown after a 0 - 0 draw with Rochdale in April 1999.<ref>Johnny Meynell, Halifax Town from Ball to Lillis, 1999, p161</ref>

===Return to Conference===
[[Chris Wilder]] was appointed Halifax manager in July 2002.<ref name=halman/> In their first season back in the [[Conference National|Conference]] the Shaymen finished in eighth position.<ref name=fchd>{{cite web|title=Halifax Town|url=http://www.fchd.info/HALIFAXT.HTM|work=Playing record by season and cup results|publisher=Football Club History Database|accessdate=27 August 2011}}</ref>

In [[2005-06 in English football|2005–06]] the Shaymen reached the [[Conference National Playoff Final 2006|play-off final]], against [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] at [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City's]] [[Walkers Stadium]] on 20 May 2006. Goals from [[Lewis Killeen]] and [[John Grant (footballer)|John Grant]] put Halifax 2–1 ahead but [[Guy Ipoua]] levelled the score for Hereford in the 80th minute and the game went into extra time. [[Ryan Green]] scored the winner for Hereford in the 109th minute and Halifax missed out on a return to the Football League.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/4771819.stm | work=BBC News | title=Halifax 2-3 Hereford (aet) | date=20 May 2006 | accessdate=12 January 2013}}</ref>

===Financial failure and dissolution===
In 2007, the club was placed into administration by a local consortium trying to buy the club.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/7296448.stm | work=BBC News | title=Halifax apply for administration | date=14 March 2008 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/7296448.stm|title=Halifax apply for administration |date=14 March 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref> In spite of being docked 10 points for entering administration, the club again survived relegation on the last day of the season.  However, the club failed to get a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) to bring the club out of administration.,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/7448831.stm| title=Halifax fail with demotion appeal |date=12 June 2008|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/7392851.stm | work=BBC News | title=Halifax on the brink of collapse | date=9 May 2008 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> and was demoted by three divisions to the [[Northern Premier League Division One North]] as a result. {{cn|date=April 2016}}

Though the club appealed against the decision to remove it from the [[Football Conference]],<ref>[http://www.bluesqfootball.com/story/0,20970,13040_3665473,00.html BlueSq Premier | North | South | Latest news on the new Blue Square Premier, North and South season | Conference AGM news<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the appeal was unsuccessful and the club was wound up.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/halifax_town/7448831.stm | work=BBC News | title=Halifax fail with demotion appeal | date=12 June 2008 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

In May 2008 it had been revealed that following a major error, the club owed over £800,000 to [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]], making the club more than £2 million in the red.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

The Supporters' Trust prepared a back-up plan to form a new club should it be required. However,the club was re-formed by the same directors of the previous legal entity under the name [[F.C. Halifax Town]] and was accepted to play in the [[Northern Premier League Division One North]] in the 2008/09 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.halifaxafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/SupportersTrustDetail/0,,10437~1328189,00.html|title=HTST Advise Town Accepted Into Unibond|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006101539/http://www.halifaxafc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/SupportersTrustDetail/0,,10437~1328189,00.html|archive-date=6 October 2008|date= 6 June 2008}}</ref>

==Stadiums==
The club moved to [[The Shay]] in 1921 (hence the team's nickname "The Shaymen") and remained there until they folded.

From the mid-1990s on the Shay underwent substantial development, and [[Halifax RLFC]] moved in and shared the venue. The [[Football Trust]] assisted in providing funds for the redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Shay stadium|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/3581/29/|publisher=When Saturday Comes|accessdate=18 February 2011|author=Keith Butterick|date=November 2000}}</ref>
