He first drove in [[Formula One]] with [[WilliamsF1|Williams F1]] in the [[1994 Formula One season|1994 season]] succeeding the late [[Ayrton Senna]]. The following year he won his first Grand Prix in [[1995 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]], and then for the [[1996 Formula One season|1996 season]] he moved to [[McLaren]].

He won five races throughout [[1999 Formula One season|1999]] and [[2000 Formula One season|2000]] before finishing 2nd in the Drivers' Championship to [[Michael Schumacher]] in [[2001 Formula One season|2001]]. Two more victories followed between [[2002 Formula One season|2002]] and [[2003 Formula One season|2003]] before he left McLaren at the end of [[2004 Formula One season|2004]]. He moved to [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] in 2005 and secured their first podium a year later. Coulthard retired from Formula One racing at the end of [[2008 Formula One season|2008]].

==Formula One career==

===Williams (1994–95)===

====1994====

[[File:Coulthard Williams.jpg|thumb|right|Coulthard at the [[1994 British Grand Prix]]]]
Throughout 1993 and 1994, Coulthard was employed by [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering]] team as their official test driver. A race seat became available after the death of [[Ayrton Senna]] in the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]]. Coulthard received a telephone call from team principal [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] to test the Williams car at [[Circuito de Jerez|Jerez]] circuit over four days, causing him to miss a Formula 3000 race at [[Pau Grand Prix|Pau]].<ref name=motorsportapril1995/><ref>{{cite web|last=Hunston|first=Hugh|title=Coulthard bound for Barcelona to replace Senna|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/coulthard-bound-for-barcelona-to-replace-senna-1.501772|work=Herald Scotland|publisher=Newsquest|date=21 May 1994|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>

Making his début in [[1994 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]], Coulthard qualified in eighth position, and was set to score a point before his engine failed 34 laps from the finish. He followed this up by scoring his first points with a fifth-place finish in [[1994 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]]. Williams dropped Coulthard for the following race in [[1994 French Grand Prix|France]], allowing 1992 Drivers' Champion [[Nigel Mansell]] to make a one-off appearance due to pressure from engine supplier [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Damon|authorlink=Damon Hill|title=Grand Prix Year: Damon Hill - The Inside Story of A Formula One Season|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishing]]|date=1995|page=146|isbn= 0-333-62308-8}}</ref> The move strained the relationship between Williams and Coulthard<ref>{{cite web|title=A Sporting Nation - David Coulthard's best season 2001|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0054/|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref> who returned for the [[1994 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]], finishing fifth. For Germany, Williams introduced a revised version of their car, the [[Williams FW16B]]. He suffered back to back retirements in the next two races but secured three consecutive points scoring positions—including a podium finish with a second-place in [[1994 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]]. Mansell later returned to fill Coulthard's seat for the final three races of the season. Coulthard finished the season in eighth place with Williams second in the Constructors Championship. For his role, Coulthard was awarded ITV Young Sports Personality of the Year and received an award at the BBC Scottish Sports Personality of the Year.<ref>{{cite book|last=Couldwell|first=Clive|title=Formula One: Made in Britain|publisher=Random House|year=2003|isbn=978-1448132-942}}</ref>

In November, Coulthard became embroiled in a contract dispute. During the Australian Grand Prix, Coulthard chose to leave Williams and signed a contract with [[McLaren]].<ref name=contractdispute>{{cite web|title=Coulthard for McLaren|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00292.html|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|date=25 September 1995|accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref> Williams, however, insisted that they had the right to exercise their option to keep Coulthard, who was on a three-year contract with the team.<ref>{{cite web|title=Legal formula to solve dispute|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/legal-formula-to-solve-dispute-1.475399|work=Herald Scotland|publisher=Newsquest|date=2 December 1994|accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref> Coulthard's management argued that the Williams option was not binding.<ref name=contractdispute /> The dispute went to Formula One's Contract Recognition Board, who ruled in favour of Williams on 14 December, forcing Coulthard to stay with the team.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fielding|first=Kelvin|title=FIA rules in favour of Williams in Coulthard dispute|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/fia-rules-in-favour-of-williams-in-coulthard-dispute|publisher=Motorsport.com|accessdate=17 August 2014|location=Paris|date=14 December 1994}}</ref>

====1995====
[[File:David Coulthard 1995 Britain.jpg|thumb|right|Coulthard at the [[1995 British Grand Prix]]]]
In 1995, Coulthard again competed with Williams alongside [[Damon Hill]]. He was optimistic for the season, saying: "I'd like to think I can win a Grand Prix this year. That's really my aim, plus to score points in as many races as possible."<ref name=motorsportapril1995/> Coulthard's season started off with controversy when he and Benetton driver [[Michael Schumacher]] were disqualified for fuel irregularities in the first round in [[1995 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], where Coulthard finished second.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Richard|title=Schumacher and Coulthard Disqualified|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/schumacher-and-coulthard-disqualified-1613059.html|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Limited|date=27 March 1995|accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref> On appeal, the original results of both drivers were reinstated.<ref>{{cite book|chapter = 1995 Grands Prix: Brazilian Grand Prix|last = Henry|first = Alan|authorlink = Alan Henry|title = [[Autocourse]] 1995–96|origyear = 1995|publisher = Hazleton Publishing|isbn = 1-874557-36-5|page = 90|date=December 1995}}</ref> The next five races saw four retirements for Coulthard, plus a fourth-place finish in [[1995 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]].

===McLaren (1996–2004)===

====1996====
[[File:1996 San Marino David Coulthard.jpg|thumb|left|Coulthard at the [[1996 San Marino Grand Prix]]]]
For 1996, Coulthard partnered experienced driver [[Mika Häkkinen]] at McLaren, and believed there was a chance of winning races, though a challenge for the World Championship was unlikely until 1997 or 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coulthard throws cold water on McLaren hopes|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00506.html|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|date=4 March 1996|accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref> His season started badly; he suffered a throttle issue in [[1996 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], including a collision with Jordan driver [[Martin Brundle]] on the first lap. Coulthard spun off in [[1996 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] and finished outside of the points in [[1996 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]]. However, Coulthard secured a podium at the [[1996 European Grand Prix|Nürburgring]] before suffering a hydraulics failure in [[1996 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]].

He followed the result with a second-place finish in the wet race at [[1996 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] before suffering a first-lap accident in the wet race in [[1996 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]]. Before the [[1996 Canadian Grand Prix|Canadian Grand Prix]], Coulthard signed an extension to his contract that would keep him at McLaren until 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coulthard stays at McLaren|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00632.html|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|date=3 June 1996|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> Coulthard secured points finishing positions in the next four races, before suffering three consecutive retirements. He rounded these results by finishing outside of the points-scoring positions in [[1996 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]] and [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]]. Coulthard managed to secure seventh place in the Drivers' Championship and McLaren finished fifth in the Constructors' Championship.

====1997====
In 1997, Coulthard again partnered Häkkinen at McLaren. He started his season by taking victory in the opening round in [[1997 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Formula One - 1997 race summaries|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/13140.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=24 October 1997|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> Coulthard was unable to score in the next four rounds, due to being involved in an collision in [[1997 Argentine Grand Prix|Argentina]] and contended with unreliability with his car. The factor of unreliability had an impact throughout the season, which became notable in [[1997 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] when Coulthard made a pit stop while leading and the car developed clutch problems. He suffered from four more retirements throughout the season, and was able to take victory at the [[1997 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Coulthard wins the Italian Grand Prix|url=http://www.atlasf1.com/news/1997/507.htm|work=Atlas F1|publisher=Haymarket Publications|date=7 September 1997|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref>

====1998====
[[File:Coulthard.jpg|thumb|right|Coulthard at the [[1998 Canadian Grand Prix]]]]
In 1998, Coulthard remained at McLaren and continued to be parterned by Häkkinen. The season started controversially in [[1998 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]] for the McLaren team when Coulthard, who was leading let Häkkinen past to win the race. Coulthard later revealed an pre-race agreement by the team that whoever led into the first corner on the first lap would be allowed to win the race.<ref>{{cite news|title=Protest lodged against Hakkinen win|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/formula_1/63737.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=9 March 1998|accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref> However, the race marked a run of consistent results, with Coulthard scoring three further podiums, including victory in [[1998 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Goren|first=Biranit|title=Coulthard wins San Marino Grand Prix|url=http://www.atlasf1.com/news/1998/680.htm|work=Atlas F1|publisher=Haymarket Publications|date=26 April 1998|accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref> Coulthard retired from three out of the next four races, and followed this up by taking a further five podiums during the remainder of the season, including a retirement in [[1998 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1998: Coulthard, David |url=http://www.formula1.com/results/driver/1998/11.html |work=Formula1.com |publisher=Formula One Administration |accessdate=18 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140623050110/http://www.formula1.com:80/results/driver/1998/11.html |archivedate=23 June 2014 }}</ref>

His only finish outside of the points-scoring positions was in [[1998 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], finishing 7th, in a race where Coulthard lost control of his car, causing a multi-car collision and was unsighted behind Schumacher when being lapped by the Ferrari driver, who was forced to retire.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hill wins as Schumacher storms out|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/formula_1/161298.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=30 August 1998|accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref> Coulthard came third in the Drivers' Championship, behind Schumacher and Häkkinen,<ref>{{cite web|title=1998 Formula One Drivers' Championship Standings |url=http://www.formula1.com/results/driver/1998/ |work=Formula1.com |publisher=Formula One Administration |accessdate=18 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20141120050525/http://www.formula1.com:80/results/driver/1998/ |archivedate=20 November 2014 }}</ref> and helped McLaren clinch the Constructors' Championship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mika wins as Schu let down by puncture|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/formula_1/205429.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=2 November 1998|accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref> Coulthard was awarded the [[Hawthorn Memorial Trophy]], an annual award given to the most successful British or Commonwealth driver in Formula One over the course of one season.<ref name=hawthorntrophy>{{cite web|title=David Coulthard wins Hawthorn Memorial Trophy |url=http://www.aemc.org.uk/MSA_03-017_Hawthorn_Memorial_Trophy.pdf |publisher=Motor Sports Association |date=17 July 2003 |accessdate=19 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20140826115352/http://www.aemc.org.uk/MSA_03-017_Hawthorn_Memorial_Trophy.pdf |archivedate=26 August 2014 }}</ref>

For 2000, Coulthard reorganised his schedule for the season, concentrating on his performances and spending less time working on promotional campaigns. Many motorsport critics labelled 2000 as Coulthard's "make or break" year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coulthard: Scotland's fastest man|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/motorsport/733570.stm|work=BBC News|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=2 May 2000|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref>

The first rounds of the season proved difficult for Coulthard; In the opening round in [[2000 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], he retired from engine problems, and finished second in [[2000 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], before being disqualified as the front wing endplates on his car 7mm lower than the required 50mm above the reference plane.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coulthard Disqualified from the Brazilian GP|url=http://www.atlasf1.com/news/2000/mar/2193.htm|work=Atlas F1|publisher=Haymarket Publications|date=26 March 2000|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> Coulthard overcame these setbacks and finished on the podium in the next five races, which included victories in [[2000 British Grand Prix|Britain]] and [[2000 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]].

McLaren team principal [[Ron Dennis]] was ambitious about Coulthard's prospects for the new season, saying: "David is extremely fired up. He's strong and wants to test as much as possible.

====2002====
The [[2002 Formula One season|2002]] season was the first in which Coulthard was the more experienced driver in his team. He was optimistic for the new season, saying: "If they need an opinion then they have to come to me this year. In the past they didn't. But that said, it's important for me not to get bogged down in the history of what happened in the past.

====2003====
Coulthard was again partnered at McLaren by Räikkönen for 2003. Former World Drivers' Champion [[Niki Lauda]] aired doubts over Coulthard's ability to handle pressure with team-mate Räikkönen over the coming season, saying: "Coulthard has the advantage of experience - as I did over Prost - but in qualifying Raikkonen has put him under a lot of pressure."<ref>{{cite news|title=Coulthard 'faces tough 2003'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/2335917.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=17 October 2002|accessdate=21 August 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Coulthard RedBull Canada2005.jpg|thumb|right|Coulthard at the [[2005 Canadian Grand Prix]]]]
Following the purchase of the Jaguar team by [[Red Bull]], Coulthard announced on 17 December 2004 that he would leave McLaren to move to Red Bull for the [[2005 Formula One season|2005 season]]. He signed a one-year deal for a reported £1.8 million to drive alongside Austrian driver [[Christian Klien]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Henry|first=Alan|title=Coulthard signs for year with Red Bull|url=http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/dec/18/formulaone.formulaone2004|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|date=18 December 2004|accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref>  Coulthard was offered a testing role at Ferrari, which he declined as he decided to remain in a race seat.<ref>{{cite news|title=Coulthard rejected Ferrari test|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4247383.stm|work=BBC Sport|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=8 February 2005|accessdate=18 August 2014}}</ref>

Coulthard's season started with finishes in the points-scoring positions in the opening five rounds.

==Driving style==
[[File:David Coulthard helmet.jpg|thumb|right|Coulthard's helmet when driving for Williams]]
Coulthard became known for having a smooth driving style. This style allowed him to perform at circuits where chicanes are common. However, this also meant that he was not suited to modern-day circuit configurations where a majority of the corners are taken at a medium-speed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Paul|title=David Coulthard: The Quest For Success|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/feb23/murray.html|work=Atlas F1|publisher=Haymarket Publications|date=23 February 2000|accessdate=17 August 2014}}</ref>

During his Formula Ford career, Coulthard gained a reputation of performing better at races than during qualifying sessions. The problem became particularly prevalent during 2003, when one-lap qualifying was introduced, in an effort for smaller teams to gain more television exposure.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Schumacher era continues|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/season/1381.html|work=ESPN.co.uk|publisher=ESPN Sports Media Ltd.|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> Coulthard became an open vocal opponent of the format, saying: "I just don't like the single-lap qualifying format, I don't think it's right that one lap judges whether you are fast or not."<ref>{{cite news|last=Tremayne|first=David|title=Coulthard insists single-lap qualifying is unfair test|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/coulthard-insists-singlelap-qualifying-is-unfair-test-94670.html|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent Print Limited|date=4 July 2003|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref>

==Helmet design==
Coulthard's helmet design is blue and consists of a white saltire on the top which resembles the [[flag of Scotland]] and the four tips are trepassed from the top of the chin area. Coulthard borrowed a helmet belonging to Michael Schumacher for the [[1996 Monaco Grand Prix]] as his regular helmet was suffering from steaming up during the weekend.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grand Prix Results: Monaco GP, 1996|url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr587.html|work=GrandPrix.com|publisher=Inside F1, Inc.|date=19 May 1996|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> Upon Schumacher's first retirement in 2006, he suggested to Coulthard that he would swap one of his own helmets for one of Coulthard's, which was agreed by Coulthard.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coulthard|first=David|title=I only hope Michael Schumacher pulls through so that he can see all the nice things people are saying about him|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/motorsport/formulaone/michael-schumacher/10543292/I-only-hope-Michael-Schumacher-pulls-through-so-that-he-can-see-all-the-nice-things-people-are-saying-about-him.html|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|date=30 December 2013|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> For the [[2007 Japanese Grand Prix]], he changed his design to grey with a stylised saltire on the sides of his helmet, as an homage to the late World Rally Champion Colin McRae.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coulthard to honour McRae in Japan |url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/9/6828.html |work=Formula1.com |publisher=Formula One Management |date=26 September 2007 |accessdate=22 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20130604151619/http://www.formula1.com:80/news/headlines/2007/9/6828.html |archivedate=4 June 2013 }}</ref>
