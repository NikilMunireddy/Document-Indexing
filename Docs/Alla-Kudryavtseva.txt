'''Alla Alexandrovna Kudryavtseva''' ({{lang-ru|Алла Александровна Кудрявцева}}; born 3 November 1987) is a Russian professional [[tennis]] player.

Kudryavtseva has won one singles and eight doubles title on the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] tour, as well as two singles and thirteen doubles titles on the [[International Tennis Federation|ITF]] tour in her career. On 4 October 2010, she reached her best singles ranking of world number 56. On 8 September 2014, she peaked at world number 15 in the doubles rankings.

==Pro career==
===Early career===
Kudryavtseva debuted at the [[Women's Tennis Association|WTA]] Tour in the [[2004 Kremlin Cup]], where she could not succeed beyond the qualifying round. In the following season her best result in the WTA tour was reaching the 1st Rounds of the [[Nordea Nordic Light Open]] in [[Stockholm]] in singles and the [[Banka Koper Slovenia Open]] in doubles. 

Her first Major appearance was at the [[2006 Australian Open]], where she could not win a qualification round. The same result was seen at the other three [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]]s. Among her more notable results in that season were reaching the singles quarterfinals of the [[2006 Sunfeast Open – Singles|Sunfeast Open]] in [[Kolkata]], [[India]], and the semifinals in doubles of the [[2006 Tashkent Open|Tashkent Open]], with Canadian [[Stéphanie Dubois]].

===2007–11: Steady progress===
In 2007, Kudryavtseva debuted in the main draw of the [[2007 Australian Open|Australian Open]], reaching the 2nd Rounds in singles and doubles. With [[Hsieh Su-wei]] she reached her first WTA final at the [[2007 Sony Ericsson International – Doubles|Sony Ericsson International]] in [[Bangalore]], India, losing to a pair from [[Chinese Taipei|Taipei]]. Again in Kolkata, Kudryavtseva with [[Vania King]] won her first title. Her best result in singles was reaching the [[2007 Barcelona KIA – Singles|Barcelona KIA tournament]].

Now partnering with [[Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova]], she could reach the final at the [[2008 Internazionali Femminili di Palermo – Doubles|Internazionali Femminili di Palermo]], losing to [[Sara Errani]] and [[Nuria Llagostera Vives]]. She played alongside several doubles partners, including King and [[Vera Dushevina]]. Meanwhile in singles, Kudryavtseva fought her way through the 4th Round of [[2008 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Singles|Wimbledon]], which is to date her best result in a Grand Slam singles event. There she defeated 3rd-seeded [[Maria Sharapova]].

Kudryavtseva progressed in doubles in the next season, climbing with [[Ekaterina Makarova]] the final of the Premier Mandatory [[2009 China Open – Women's Doubles|China Open]], eventually losing to Chinese pair [[Hsieh Su-wei]] and [[Peng Shuai]]. Kudryavtseva/Dushevina could reach the quarterfinals of the [[2009 Rogers Cup – Doubles|Rogers Cup]].

The Russian two times in succession reached the finals in singles, becoming champion in [[2010 Tashkent Open – Singles|Tashkent]] and before that runner-up [[2010 Guangzhou International Women's Open – Singles|Guangzhou]]. As a result she attained her highest to date year-end ranking, 61. With her new partner [[Anastasia Rodionova]] she also reached two finals in doubles, winning the [[2010 UNICEF Open – Women's Doubles|UNICEF Open]].

In the 2011 season she and [[Olga Govortsova]] reached three WTA finals at the [[2011 Cellular South Cup – Doubles|Cellular South Cup]], [[2011 Aegon Classic – Doubles|Aegon Classic]] and [[2011 Citi Open|Citi Open]], the first two of which they won.

Kudryavtseva and Makarova became quarterfinalists of the [[2012 Australian Open – Women's Doubles|2012 Australian Open]], eventually losing to Errani/[[Roberta Vinci|Vinci]]; this became her best result in a Grand Slam doubles tournament. However, her 2012 season was rather poor, eventually skipping the WTA tour for ITF tournaments at season end.

===From 2013: Breakthrough in doubles===
The back and forth switching of ITF and WTA tournaments continued until showing with Rodionova significant results since late April. They won the [[2013 Challenge Bell – Doubles|Challenge Bell]], and also reached the final of the [[2013 Kremlin Cup – Women's Doubles|Kremlin Cup]]. Furthermore, the two became semifinalists at the Premier 5 events [[2013 Internazionali BNL d'Italia – Women's Doubles|Internezionali BNL d'Italia]] and [[2013 Toray Pan Pacific Open – Doubles|Toray Pan Pacific Open]]. Kudryavtseva returned to the top 50 as a result of her successful season.

In 2014, Kudryavtseva/Rodionova entered the [[2014 Wimbledon Championships – Women's Doubles|Wimbledon Championships]], where they lost against [[Tímea Babos|Babos]]/[[Kristina Mladenovic|Mladenovic]]. They also reached the semifinals in [[2014 Western & Southern Open – Women's Doubles|Cincinnati]] and [[2014 China Open – Women's Doubles|Beijing]], the quarterfinals in [[2014 Sony Open Tennis – Women's Doubles|Miami]], [[2014 Qatar Total Open – Doubles|Doha]] and [[2014 Wuhan Open – Doubles|Wuhan]]. She and her partner won the tournaments in [[2014 Dubai Tennis Championships – Women's Doubles|Dubai]] and [[2014 Brisbane International – Women's Doubles|Brisbane]], and additionally running-up in [[2014 PTT Pattaya Open|Pattaya]]. As a consequence she pushed into the top-20 in doubles, reaching a career-high ranking of 15.

Kudryavtseva/Rodionova entered in their debut [[2014 WTA Finals|Championships]] in Singapore, beating in the quarterfinals fourth seeded [[Ekaterina Makarova|Makarova]]/[[Elena Vesnina|Vesnina]], 4–6, 6–2, [10–6]. In the semifinals they were defeated by title defenders Su-wei/Shuai, 1–6, 4–6.
