The '''Alberta Liberal Party''' is a [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial]] [[political party]] in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. Founded in 1905 it was the dominant political party until 1921 when it was defeated.  Since 1921, it has formed the [[official opposition]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] several times, most recently from 1993 until 2012. Fourteen Liberals have served as [[Leader of the Opposition (Alberta)|Leader of the Opposition]] of Alberta.

==History==

===Early years===
{{Expand section|date=April 2008}}

The Liberals formed the government in Alberta for the first 16 years of the province's existence. [[Alexander C. Rutherford]] (1905–1910),  [[Arthur L. Sifton]] (1910–1917) and [[Charles Stewart (1868–1946)|Charles Stewart]] (1917–1921) led Liberal governments, until the party was swept from office in the [[Alberta general election, 1921|1921 election]] by the [[United Farmers of Alberta]].

===1921: Loss of power===

When Premier [[Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)|Charles Stewart]] resigned as leader after his government's defeat at the hands of the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1921|1921 election]], [[John R. Boyle]], a former [[Attorney General|Attorney-General]], led the legislative caucus until he was appointed to the judiciary in 1924, and [[Charles R. Mitchell]], also a former cabinet minister succeeded him. [[John C. Bowen]] acted in the interim until a party convention chose [[Joseph Tweed Shaw]], a former independent [[Ginger Group|left-wing]] M.P.

In the lead-up to the [[Alberta general election, 1930|1930 election]], the party chose [[George H. Webster]], M.L.A. for Calgary City. He resigned in favour of [[William R. Howson]], who led the party energetically if unsuccessfully in [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935]]. After he was appointed to the provincial superior court in 1936, [[Edward Leslie Gray]] succeeded him.

===Unity coalition===
Discussions on a coalition of opposition forces began in the early thirties to put together a strong opposition to the United Farmers government. The Liberals refused to join when their fortunes were going up during the leadership [[William R. Howson|William Howson]]. At the height of Liberal popularity they had managed to lure two United Farmers MLAs to sit in the Liberal caucus.

After the defeat of old line parties by Social Credit in the [[Alberta general election, 1935|1935 Alberta general election]], the coalition idea picked up steam. Edward Gray, Liberal leader cautiously entered the party into the Unity Movement giving riding associations the opportunity to support Liberal candidates or Independent candidates.<ref name="machined">{{cite news |title= Liberals Against Independents If "Machined into Field" – Gray |publisher= The Lethbridge Herald |page=7 |volume=Vol XXXIII, No. 36 |date= January 23, 1940}}</ref>

The Alberta Liberals were tepid to support the [[Independent Citizens' Association]] led by [[John Percy Page]]. They wanted the Independents to remain independent and were against having a new party formed based on the coalition. The Liberals maintained the party organization by keeping the Constituency Associations and Party Executive Intact. After Gray resigned the leadership on April 19, 1941 to accept a patronage position the party did not officially replace him as leader until James Prowse in 1947.

The President of the Party who stood for election annually, became the official face of the party in all matters of party business. The party also kept a rump caucus from 1940 to 1944 that started out with one member and got to three by dissolution in 1944. The Liberals despite internal pressure to break with the coalition agreed not to run candidates in the 1944 election.

Cooperation with the Independents officially came to an end when the federal [[Camrose (electoral district)|Camrose]] riding association passed a motion at a meeting in August 1945 calling on the executive of the provincial Liberal party to reorganize in all Alberta provincial constituencies free of alliances and arrangements with other parties.<ref name="LibsinAb">{{cite news|title=Liberals In Alberta|date=August 13, 1945|publisher=The Lethbridge Daily Herald|work=XXXVIII No. 206 |page=7}}</ref>

The party held a meeting on January 7, 1946 to discuss proposals to participate in the [[Alberta general election, 1948|1948 Alberta general election]].<ref name="react">{{cite news|title=City Liberals Meet Stambaugh|publisher=The Lethbridge Daily Herald|date=January 8, 1946|page=7|work=Vol XXXIX No 22}}</ref>

===Post-war===
Prowse became the first true leader of the party in the post coalition era. He led the party from 1947 to 1958 leading to significant gains in popular votes and seats. He resigned the leadership to run for Mayor of Edmonton, and was succeeded by [[John Walter Grant MacEwan]], M.L.A. for Calgary City. MacEwan was beset by problems entirely beyond his ability to control. The electoral ability of any [[Opposition (parliamentary)|opposition party]] leader became very chancy with the abolition of the STV [[Voting system|electoral system]] used for Edmonton and Calgary cities.

The Manning government had successfully renewed and reinvigorated itself, and recovered much of the ground it had previously lost, while the recent Diefenbaker landslide made the Progressive Conservative Party seem a more attractive vehicle for the party's traditional supporters.

MacEwan was the first of many leaders who faced a problem similar to those of Liberals in Britain and other Western [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]]. Ideologically, the party was being squeezed between traditional conservatism and [[social democracy]]. In a social sense, the party presented an older and more traditional image in comparison to the Alberta Progressive Conservatives, who, given the predominance of Social Credit, seemed fairly liberal. Almost inevitably, the Liberals were reduced to a single member, [[Michael Maccagno]] of [[Lac La Biche (provincial electoral district)|Lac La Biche]]. MacEwan retired shortly after this disaster.

===1960s===
He was succeeded by [[David B. Hunter]], then mayor of Athabasca, who campaigned aggressively on the creation of a [[Public company|publicly owned]] [[Electric power|electrical power]] company, with strong environmentalist overtones. This likely limited any growth by the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|Alberta New Democrats]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1963|1963 election]], and it established the party with a distinct image and identity separate from the Progressive Conservatives. However, it was internally divisive, and a number of candidates, including one of its two successful ones, repudiated the platform's main plank. Hunter himself was defeated personally in Athabasca. He did not resign until after he lost a later byelection, when he decided to run for Parliament (unsuccessfully).

Maccagno, who was leader of the minuscule opposition in the Legislature, served as interim leader, but did not regard himself as leadership material. In a convention which exposed the deep ideological fault lines within the party, [[Adrian Berry]], a Calgary lawyer, emerged as leader from a highly acrimonious contest. Internal dissensions continued, and late in 1966, Berry resigned under circumstances still not explained. As a provincial election could be expected within months, Maccagno became leader almost by default, and somewhat unwillingly led the party into the [[Alberta general election, 1967|1967 provincial election]].

Maccagno was elected, the first Liberal leader since 1955 and the last until 1986 to achieve the feat and the party increased its representation from two to three seats. However, the party placed fourth in the popular vote. [[Peter Lougheed]] and the Progressive Conservatives presented the attraction of a modern, urban-based party which was decidedly more liberal than the Social Credit government.  The Tories displaced the Liberals as the apparent alternative to the Socreds.

===Shut out===
The next four years were a bad time for the Liberals.  The party placed very poorly in a byelection to replace a Liberal MLA who had died, and the party had lost its other two seats when Maccagno resigned to run in the 1968 federal election and then in November 1969 the last remaining Liberal MLA, [[Bill Dickie (politician)|Bill Dickie]], [[crossed the floor]] to join Lougheed's Progressive Conservatives, who had rapidly established themselves as a credible government-in-waiting.

In 1969, the party chose a Calgary clergyman turned businessman, [[John T. Lowery]], to succeed Maccagno.  Lowery thought he saw some hope in an electoral arrangement with Social Credit, which he believed was showing signs of modernization and rejuvenation under Manning's successor, [[Harry Strom]]. He was likely encouraged in this by the party's two federal Cabinet ministers, [[Bud Olson]] and [[Patrick Morgan Mahoney|Pat Mahoney]], who had Social Credit pasts. When word of negotiations to that effect came out, it became evident that any such proposal was deeply opposed by the core membership of both parties. Lowery resigned in the face of it.

The following year saw the provincial Liberals come very close to extinction. The party's political credibility had been steadily eroding, and with the negotiations with Social Credit, it was not immediately clear that it had any ideological purpose. There was much discussion of the party abandoning provincial politics altogether (there was only one organization at federal and provincial levels), and concentrating on federal politics, which looked a great deal more hopeful at the time than they did two years later.

It took a major act of will for the party to decide to soldier on as an independent force, which it did in repudiating Lowery, and deciding to contest the [[Alberta general election, 1971|1971 election]], however hopeless the prospects might be. The party chose, almost by default, [[Bob Russell (Alberta politician)|Robert Russell]] of St. Albert, a highly controversial figure who had been passed over twice, but who had a strong desire for the position, and who had strongly supported David Hunter's vision for the party.

The party suffered as bad a defeat as anyone could have expected in the 1971 election. It was shut out of the legislature altogether in an election that saw Social Credit defeated after 36 years in power at the hands of Lougheed's Progressive Conservatives.

It is widely argued that the provincial Liberals' popularity in Alberta was especially hurt during the federal government of [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Liberal Party of Canada]] between 1968 and 1984. Trudeau's policies were unpopular in western Canada and especially in Alberta, particularly [[official bilingualism]], and the [[National Energy Program]] (NEP), which exacerbated feelings of [[western alienation]].  During this period, the provincial Liberal party suffered because of its connections with its federal cousins.

===1986: Return to the legislature===
The Liberals' fortunes improved in the late 1980s and they returned to the Alberta legislature in the [[Alberta general election, 1986|1986 election]], when leader [[Nicholas Taylor]] led them to win 4 seats and 12% of the popular vote. Following the 1987 [[leadership review]], a leadership contest was held in 1988.

The race was contested by Taylor, MLA, [[Sheldon Chumir]], MLA, [[Grant Mitchell (politician)|Grant Mitchell]], and [[Edmonton]] Mayor [[Laurence Decore]]. Decore was elected leader of the party on a first ballot victory.

The Alberta Liberal Party ran one candidate in the [[Alberta Senate nominee election, 1989|1989 Senate Election]], [[Bill Code]], who finished with 22.5% of the vote.

===The party in the 1990s===
In the [[Alberta general election, 1993|1993 election]], the Liberals, under former [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] mayor [[Laurence Decore]], enjoyed their greatest success since holding power when they swept Edmonton, winning a total of 32 seats, and collecting 39% of the popular vote. This enabled the party to displace the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]] to become the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Official Opposition]] to the [[Alberta Progressive Conservatives|Progressive Conservative]] government of [[Ralph Klein]].

In 1994, Decore resigned as leader and four MLAs contested the leadership race: [[Edmonton McClung]] MLA [[Grant Mitchell (politician)|Grant Mitchell]], [[Fort McMurray]] MLA [[Adam Germain]], [[Edmonton Roper]] MLA [[Sine Chadi]], and [[Calgary-Buffalo]] MLA [[Gary Dickson]]. After all the ballots had been counted, Mitchell was elected as party leader.

The party continued to hold its position as Official Opposition, but lost 10 seats in the [[Alberta general election, 1997|1997 election]]. With 18 seats in the Alberta legislature, Mitchell resigned as leader, and another race was declared.

The 1998 [[Leadership convention|leadership race]] also saw four contestants: former [[Alberta Progressive Conservatives|Progressive Conservative]] [[Minister (government)|cabinet minister]] [[Nancy MacBeth]], [[Lethbridge East]] MLA [[Ken Nicol (politician)|Ken Nicol]], [[Edmonton Meadowlark]] MLA [[Karen Leibovici]], and [[Edmonton Riverview]] MLA [[Linda Sloan]]. MacBeth was elected on the first ballot.

===The 2000s===
[[Image:Taft at Holy 2008-02-20 04a.jpg|right|thumb|Liberal candidates at a press conference in Calgary during the 2008 election (left-to-right):  [[Dave Taylor (Canadian politician)|Dave Taylor]], [[David Swann]], [[Kevin Taft]], [[Darshan Kang]], [[Harry B. Chase]], and [[Avalon Roberts]]]]
In the [[Alberta general election, 2001|2001 election]], MacBeth led a  campaign which ended with only seven Liberal [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]]s being elected. MacBeth also lost her own seat in the election.

In the days following the [[Alberta general election, 2001|2001 election]], MacBeth resigned and [[Ken Nicol (politician)|Ken Nicol]] was acclaimed leader. Nicol led the party until 2004, when he ran for the federal [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in the Lethbridge riding. [[Edmonton Mill Woods]] MLA [[Don Massey]] briefly stood as [[interim leader]] until a leadership race was held.

On March 27, 2004, [[Kevin Taft]] was elected the new leader of the Alberta Liberal Party. In the [[Alberta general election, 2004|2004 provincial election]], the Liberals more than doubled their seats to 16 and increased their share of the popular vote to 29%.  More significantly, and to the surprise of most observers, the Liberals were able to win three seats in the traditionally conservative city of [[Calgary]]. Additionally, in June 2007, Craig Cheffins won in a by-election, making him the fourth Alberta Liberal MLA in Calgary.

The [[Alberta general election, 2008|provincial election of March 3, 2008]] proved to be another setback for the party. Going up against rookie Premier [[Ed Stelmach]], the Alberta Liberals had high hopes of increasing their seat count dramatically, particularly with the supposed discontent with the Tories in Calgary. However, the result was humbling for the Alberta Liberals. The party ended with only nine seats, down from 16 when the election was called. The party's power based in Edmonton was hit especially hard, with eight seats won in 2004 going Conservative. On June 26, 2008, Taft announce his intention to resign as leader. Dr. [[David Swann]] was elected as the new Liberal leader on December 13, 2008 defeating two other contenders on the first ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=1073351 |title=Article |publisher=canada.com |accessdate=October 17, 2011}}</ref>

After serving as leader for three years on February 1, 2011, Swann announced his resignation as leader. The [[Alberta Liberal Party leadership election, 2011|2011 leadership election]] saw another doctor, Dr. [[Raj Sherman]], win the leadership of the party, who then went on to lead the party into the [[Alberta general election, 2012|2012 general election]].

===Recent history===
In the [[Alberta general election, 2012|2012 general election]], the Liberals dropped from eight seats in the legislature to five. It was the third party in the legislature. Sherman announced his resignation as leader on January 26, 2015 effective immediately.<ref name=shermanresignation>{{cite news|title=Raj Sherman quits as Alberta Liberal leader, won’t seek third term as MLA|url=http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/edmonton/Liberal+leader+Sherman+resigns/10761382/story.html|accessdate=January 26, 2015|work=Edmonton Journal|date=January 26, 2015}}</ref> [[Calgary-Mountain View]] MLA and former leader [[David Swann]] was named interim leader on February 1, 2015, chosen over [[Edmonton-Centre]] MLA [[Laurie Blakeman]] in a vote by the party's board of directors.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Swann chosen as interim leader of Alberta Liberals|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/david-swann-chosen-as-interim-leader-of-alberta-liberals-1.2939733|publisher=CBC News|date=February 1, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}</ref>

Swann led the party into the [[Alberta general election, 2015|2015 provincial election]] in which the [[Alberta New Democratic Party]] swept to power with a majority government, defeating the Progressive Conservatives after 44 years. The Liberal Party was reduced from 5 seats to 1; Swann became the party's sole MLA.

A permanent leader will be chosen at the [[Alberta Liberal Party leadership election, 2017|next leadership election]] to be held in 2017.

==Ideology==
