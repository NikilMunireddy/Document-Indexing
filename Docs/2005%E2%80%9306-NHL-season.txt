The '''2005–06 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|89th]] season of operation (88th [[Season (sport)|season]] of play) of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). This was the season after the [[2004–05 NHL season|2004–05]] season which had all of its scheduled games canceled due to a [[2004–05 NHL lockout|labor dispute]] with the [[National Hockey League Players' Association]] (NHLPA) over the [[NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement|Collective Bargaining Agreement]] (CBA) between the League and its players. The [[2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2006 Stanley Cup playoffs]] began on April 21, 2006, and concluded on June 19, with the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] defeating the [[Edmonton Oilers]] to win their first [[Stanley Cup]].

==League business==
[[File:05 NHL Shield.svg|right|200px|frame|The modernized NHL shield logo was introduced for the 2005–06 season. The metallic silver color is said to have been inspired by the [[Stanley Cup]], the trophy given to the playoff champion.<ref name="NHLFAQ" />]]
On July 13, 2005, the NHL, and NHLPA jointly announced that they had tentatively agreed to a new [[collective bargaining agreement]] which would allow the resumption of hockey for the 2005–06 season. The agreement was voted on July 21 by NHLPA members, and approved by a nearly 7 to 1 margin. The following day, the NHL's [[Board of Governors]] (owners) voted unanimously to approve the new agreement.

A new logo for the NHL was also unveiled, with "NHL" printed in upward-reading letters to project a vibrant, optimistic image, and having silver as the dominant color to pay homage to the [[Stanley Cup]].<ref name="NHLFAQ">{{cite web|title=NHL FAQ|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhlhq/cba/whats_new072205.html|publisher=National Hockey League|date=July 22, 2005|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref> Also, new Eastern and Western Conference logos were unveiled before the Olympic break, with red as the dominant East color, and blue as the dominant West hue.<ref name="new-nhl-logo">{{cite news|title=NHL unveils new logo for 2005–06 season|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/07/22/nhllogo050722.html|work=CBC News|date=July 22, 2005|accessdate=June 16, 2015}}</ref>

[[Television in the United States|American television]] also had a new look. [[NBCSN|OLN]] took over broadcasting rights after [[ESPN]] decided not to renew their rights on [[cable television]]. The network, owned by [[Comcast Corporation|Comcast]], had Monday and Tuesday night games during the regular season under an exclusivity clause prohibiting local telecasts those nights in the two participating teams' markets. [[NBC]] returned as the NHL's [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] partner after [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] parted ways following the [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04 season]]. [[Comcast]] high-speed [[Cable modem|cable internet]] customers could watch at least seven games a week over the Internet as part of the new TV deal.

===Rule changes===
After experimenting with many rule changes in 2004–05 in the [[American Hockey League]] (AHL), many of the rule changes from the previous year were adopted, with changes:
*The league introduced shoot-outs at the end of over-time if the score is tied.<ref name="2006-rule-changes">{{cite book |editor=Dinger, Ralph |title=The National Hockey League Official Guide & Record Book/2010 |year=2009 |publisher=Dan Diamond & Associates |page=11 }}</ref> The [[Overtime (ice hockey)#Shootout|shootout]] features only three shots per team, and if it is still tied, the shootout becomes [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]. In preseason games (regardless of the outcome) shootouts were held.  This rule is similar to the one used in 2004–05 in the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL).  For 2005–06, however, the AHL and ECHL shootouts remained at five shots, and the SPHL adopted the five shot format.  Shootouts are only in effect for regular-season games. [[Playoff]] games will continue with twenty-minute periods until a sudden-death goal is scored.)
*The no-touch [[icing (hockey)|icing]] rule used in the AHL in 2004–05 was abolished.  However, the ECHL continues no-touch icing.
*The [[Hockey rink|neutral zone]] becomes smaller by four feet (1.2 m).<ref name="2006-rule-changes"/>
*All blue and red lines are returned to the traditional width of 12&nbsp;inches (31&nbsp;cm).  The double-width lines used in the AHL 2004–05 season were abandoned.
*If a team [[icing (hockey)|ices]] the [[Hockey puck|puck]], it is not allowed to make a line change afterwards.<ref name="2006-rule-changes"/>  (This rule was not experimented with in the 2004–05 AHL season.)
*[[Official (ice hockey)|Linesmen]] are given more discretion when it comes to waving off icing calls when they are accidentally made as the result of a failed pass attempt.
* The "two-line offside pass" rule was abolished; this rule required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's defending zone was completed on the offensive side of the center line, unless the puck crossed the line before the player.
*A longstanding [[ECHL]] rule in which players who [[Fighting in hockey|instigate a fight]] in the last five minutes of a game will be given a game misconduct penalty plus a one-game suspension is adopted.<ref name="2006-rule-changes"/>  Furthermore, the player's coach will be fined $10,000 [[United States Dollar|(US)]].
* Goaltender equipment was reduced in size by eleven percent.<ref name="2006-rule-changes"/>
*All referees are equipped with [[wireless microphone]]s so they can now announce penalties over the [[public address]] system, similar to [[National Football League]] (NFL) referees.
**With multiple penalties, only the first will be announced by the referee calling the penalty, with the others being announced by the arena's ice-side PA announcer.
*Any player that shoots the puck over the glass (without deflection) from his own defensive zone will be penalized for delay of game. After the 2006 Olympic break, the rule has been modified to read that the puck must cross the glass before crossing the blue line.
*After the 2006 Olympic break, all sticks to be used in the shootout will be measured prior to use.

The rule experimentation was based on the previous season of play in the AHL, and was based on creating a more exciting game and will create more scoring opportunities, and therefore more [[Goal (hockey)|goals]].

Furthermore, a new Competition Committee was formed to discuss future rule changes, and players were invited to participate in the discussion.

==Regular season==
In terms of total goals scored during an NHL regular season, the 2005–06 regular season turned out to be the highest-scoring in NHL history, with 7,443 goals scored in 1,230 games.<ref>http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2006_skaters.html</ref> However, the highest-scoring season in terms of goals per game still belonged to the 1992–93 regular season, in which 7,311 goals were scored in only 1,008 games, for an average of 7.25 per game (the average in 2005–06 was 6.05 per game).<ref name="hockey-reference.com">http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_1993.html</ref> The record for most shorthanded goals scored in a season, set in 1992–93 and matched in 1993–94 at 312,<ref name="hockey-reference.com"/> was broken as 318 shorthanded goals were scored.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2006.html</ref> A total of 117 shutouts were recorded,<ref>http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2006_goalies.html</ref> down from an all-time high of 192 in 2003–04. The higher offensive numbers were largely attributable, among other things, to greater frequency of power plays. In 2003–04, teams had an average of 348 power plays over 82 games.<ref>http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2004.html</ref> In 2005–06, the average number of power plays per team over 82 games was 480.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

The NHL season began on October 5, and for the first time in the League's history, all of the league's 30 teams played a game on opening night. In the first period of each game, all teams wore a jersey (sweater) with a special patch as the league and players association auctioned off those jerseys for the benefit of the [[Red Cross]] in both the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] earmarking the proceeds for [[Hurricane Katrina]] victims ([[Mississippi Sea Wolves|the Islanders' ECHL affiliate in Biloxi, Mississippi]] suspended operations for the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons because of this disaster; furthermore, the NHL had a Stanley Cup tour of ECHL cities to raise additional funds for relief efforts. On opening night of this season, [[Jean-Pierre Dumont]] of the [[Buffalo Sabres]] scored the first goal of the regular season, and [[Daniel Alfredsson]] and [[Dany Heatley]], of the [[Ottawa Senators]] became the first players to score the winning goals for a shootout in NHL history, both scoring against [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] goaltender [[Ed Belfour]]. Their sticks were subsequently sent to the nearby [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in [[Toronto]].

The [[National Hockey League All-Star Game|All-Star Game]], which would have been in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], did not take place (the city will host the event in a future year as a replacement); the league instead took a break in February so that many of its players could participate in the [[2006 Winter Olympics|XX Winter Olympic Games]] in [[Turin]], [[Italy]]. The new schedule features more intra-division games in order to promote division rivalries. Consequently, there are whole divisions in the opposite conference that teams never played during the season.

This season saw the much-hyped debuts of (and immediate rivalry between) [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Alexander Ovechkin]]. It was only the second time that two rookies had over 100 points in a season ([[Teemu Selänne|Teemu Selanne]] and [[Joé Juneau|Joe Juneau]] performed the feat in [[1992–93 NHL season|1992–93]]). Ovechkin finished with 106 points, which is third best all-time among NHL rookies. Crosby surpassed teammate [[Mario Lemieux]]'s 100-point rookie season, finishing with 102 points, currently fifth best all-time.<ref>http://www.hhof.com/html/r&rRo.shtml</ref>

On November 30, 2005, [[Joe Thornton]] was traded from the [[Boston Bruins]] to the [[San Jose Sharks]] in a four-player deal which sent forwards [[Marco Sturm]] and [[Wayne Primeau]] and defenseman [[Brad Stuart]] to Boston. Thornton went on to win the scoring title and to date has consistently been a top ten League scorer. The Bruins would not make the playoffs until 2008.

On November 26, the [[New York Rangers]] and [[Washington Capitals]] played the second-longest NHL [[Overtime (ice hockey)|shootout]] to date. Rangers defenseman [[Marek Malík|Marek Malik]] scored the winning goal in the 15th round, pulling the puck between his own legs to defeat Capitals goaltender [[Olaf Kölzig|Olaf Kolzig]], giving the Rangers the victory by the final score of 3–2.

Three early-season games had to be rescheduled due to various events. [[Hurricane Wilma]] had forced the NHL to reschedule two [[Florida Panthers]] home games, in which their game against Ottawa Senators scheduled on October 22 was rescheduled to December 5; the game against the Washington Capitals scheduled for October 29 was moved to December 1. The [[Nashville Predators]]–[[Detroit Red Wings]] game on November 22 was called off with 7:30 left in the first period after Red Wings defenseman [[Jiří Fischer|Jiri Fischer]] suffered a seizure and had to be resuscitated. It was rescheduled to January 23, 2006, with the game starting 1–0 for Nashville as [[Greg Johnson (ice hockey)|Greg Johnson]]'s goal from the original date was allowed to stand. The game that was originally scheduled for January 23 at Nashville between the two teams was moved to March 30, 2006.

On January 12, the New York Rangers retired the number 11 of long-time captain [[Mark Messier]] to the rafters of [[Madison Square Garden]]. The Rangers would beat Messier's former team, the [[Edmonton Oilers]], 5–4 in overtime.

On January 16 in Phoenix, Washington Capitals rookie winger Alexander Ovechkin [http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/news?slug=mr-powerrankings011906&prov=yhoo&type=lgns added himself] to the league's historical highlight reel by scoring a goal from his back while rolling and sliding past the goal. Ovechkin was checked to the ice by Coyotes defenseman [[Paul Mara]] on a breakaway between the Coyotes' faceoff circles, but rolled to his back, reached over his head with his stick and hooked the puck in behind goaltender [[Brian Boucher]].<ref>[https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2636503729289931176 Watch Ovechkin's goal] at [[Google Videos]] {{wayback|url=https://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2636503729289931176 |date=20120208075339 }}</ref>

On January 19, [[Los Angeles Kings]] veteran [[Winger (ice hockey)|left winger]] [[Luc Robitaille]] scored his 550th, 551st and 552nd goals as a member of the Kings, eclipsing [[Marcel Dionne]]'s franchise record of 550 goals. The 40-year-old Robitaille retired at season's end.

The season was rocked with scandal in early February when it came to light that [[Arizona Coyotes|Phoenix Coyotes]] [[Coach (sport)|Assistant Coach]] [[Rick Tocchet]] was found to be involved in a $1.6 million illegal sports [[gambling]] ring with [[Mafia]] ties. Apparently, no betting on NHL games was being done, but bets were being placed on college and professional football and college and [[Basketball|professional basketball]]. Although Coyotes [[Head Coach]] [[Wayne Gretzky]] denied any knowledge or involvement in the ring, initial reports stated that [[Telephone tapping|wiretapped]] phone conversations he had proved that he not only knew about the ring, but was trying to find ways to conceal [[Janet Jones|his wife]]'s involvement in it. He was later cleared of these accusations, but long-term implications to his reputation are still unknown. For more information, see [[Operation Slapshot]].

On April 15, in the Nashville Predators' 81st game of the season, Nashville goaltender [[Chris Mason (ice hockey)|Chris Mason]] was credited with a goal when the Phoenix Coyotes' [[Geoff Sanderson]] put the puck in his own net. Mason was awarded credit for the goal, as he was the last Predator to have touched the puck. It was the ninth regular season [[Goaltender#Goalies who have scored in a game|goal scored by a goaltender]] in NHL history. The last goal of the regular season was scored by [[Kyle Calder]] of the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in overtime in a 3–2 victory over the [[St. Louis Blues]], which ended the 2005–06 regular season at 10:50 [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]] on April 18, 2006.

The [[Tampa Bay Lightning]] narrowly avoided becoming the first team since the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the [[1995–96 NHL season|1995–96 season]] to miss the post-season after winning the Stanley Cup the previous season.

This season also marked the first time since the [[1978–79 NHL season|1978–79 season]] that the St. Louis Blues did not qualify for the Stanley Cup playoffs, ending the third-longest NHL post-season appearance streak at 25 seasons. Only the Chicago Blackhawks (28 seasons) and the Boston Bruins (29 seasons) had longer [[List of NHL franchise post-season appearance streaks|streaks]].

===Final standings===
The '''Detroit Red Wings''' won the [[Presidents' Trophy]] and home-ice advantage throughout the playoffs.

For ranking in conference, division leaders are automatically ranked 1–3. These three, plus the next five teams in the conference standings, earn playoff berths at the end of the season.

# The fewer number of games played (i.e., superior points percentage).
# The greater number of games won.
# The greater number of points earned in games between the tied clubs.
# The greater differential between goals for and against.

==Playoffs==
{{main|2006 Stanley Cup playoffs}}
[[File:Hhof stanley cup.jpg|right|175px|thumb|'''The [[Stanley Cup]]''']]
In the first round, all of the Eastern series went to the higher-seeded team. In the Western Conference, however, the opposite was the case, and every series went to the lower seed. In the semi-finals, the first-seeded [[Ottawa Senators]] were upset by the [[Buffalo Sabres]], while in the Western Conference, the eighth-seeded [[Edmonton Oilers]] defeated the fifth-seeded [[San Jose Sharks]]. The East's second seed, the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], advanced to the Conference Final and defeated Buffalo in a seven-game series. The sixth-seeded [[Anaheim Ducks|Mighty Ducks of Anaheim]] defeated the [[Colorado Avalanche]] to advance to the Western Conference Final. Edmonton continued its Cinderella story by defeating Anaheim in five games, while Carolina advanced to the final with a seven-game series win over Buffalo.

===Stanley Cup Final===
{{main|2006 Stanley Cup Finals}}
The 2006 Stanley Cup Final was contested between the Eastern Conference champion Carolina Hurricanes and the Western Conference champion Edmonton Oilers. It was Carolina's second appearance in the Final, the other being in 2002, a loss to the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. It was Edmonton's seventh appearance in the Final and their first since their fifth Cup win in 1990. Carolina defeated Edmonton in seven games to win the franchise's first Stanley Cup, becoming the tenth post-1967 expansion team and third former [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) franchise to win the Cup.
