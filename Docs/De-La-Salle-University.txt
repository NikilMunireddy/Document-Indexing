'''De La Salle University''' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''Pamantasang De La Salle'') (also referred to as '''DLSU''' or '''La Salle''') is a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], [[La Sallian educational institutions|Lasallian research university]]  in Taft Avenue, [[Malate, Manila|Malate]], [[Manila]], Philippines. It was founded in 1911 by [[Brothers of the Christian Schools|De La Salle Brothers]] as the '''De La Salle College''' in [[Paco, Manila]] with Blimond Pierre serving as its first director.<ref name='FAQ'>{{cite web | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/help/faq/gen_info.asp | title= General Information | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-14}}</ref> The college moved on September 1921 to its present location to facilitate the increase in enrollment. DLSU, granted university status in February 1975, is the oldest constituent of [[De La Salle Philippines]] (DLSP), a network of 17 Lasallian institutions established in 2006 to replace the [[De La Salle Philippines#Historical background|De La Salle University System]].<ref name='dlsp dlsu'>{{Cite web | url = http://delasalle.ph/index.php?page=about&section=dlsu | publisher=De La Salle Philippines | title = De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-14}}</ref><ref name='csb history'>{{cite web | url = http://www.dls-csb.edu.ph/default.asp?section=10&what=1000118 | title = College history | publisher=De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde | accessdate = 2011-05-14}}</ref><ref name='DLSP history'>{{Cite web | url = http://www.delasalle.ph/index.php?page=about&section=facts | title = De La Salle Philippines: A Brief History | publisher=De La Salle Philippines | accessdate = 2011-05-14}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of De La Salle University}}

DLSU traces its founding to [[Manila Archbishop]] [[Jeremiah James Harty]]. Harty believed that the establishment of a La Salle school in Manila was instrumental in preempting the spread of [[Protestantism in the Philippines]] through the arrival of the [[Thomasites]] and Protestant American churches missions.<ref name ="Handbook">{{Cite book | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/student_handbook/primer.pdf | title = Student handbook 2003–06 | publisher=De La Salle University | date = 2003-06-26 | accessdate = 2011-05-15 | location = Manila}}</ref> His request would be later endorsed in 1907 by Pope [[Pius X]]. An envoy of Lasallian Brothers arrived in 1910. Together with Harty, the Brothers searched for a suitable campus. A {{convert|13000|m2|sqft|abbr=on|adj=on}} property in Paco, Manila was purchased for this purpose.<ref name='dlsp 100 years'>{{cite web | url = http://100years.lasallian.ph/history/#page=page-1 | title = The founding (1911–1920): Prologue: A Harty Request | publisher=Philippine Lasallian Family | accessdate = 2011-05-15}}</ref>

===Early history===

De La Salle College was established as an elementary school and high school for boys on June 16, 1911 by the three Lasallian Brothers (namely Blimond Pierre Eilenbecker, Aloysius Gonzaga McGiverin and Augusto Correge) who arrived in Manila<ref name='dlsp 100 years 2'>{{cite web | url = http://100years.lasallian.ph/history/#page=page-2 | title = The founding (1911–1920): The House on Nozaleda Street | accessdate = 2011-05-15 | publisher=Philippine Lasallian Family}}</ref> in March 1911.<ref name='news history'>{{cite news | url = http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/317028/dlsu-through-100-seasons-mission-and-learning | title = DLSU through 100 seasons of mission and learning | newspaper=Manila Bulletin | date = 2011-05-06 | author=Rachel C.

On February 12, 1912, the college was [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] under the [[corporation sole|sole ownership]] of the college director, who was then Eilenbecker.<ref name="dlsp 100 years 3"/> The college was permitted to confer commercial [[high school diploma]]s in the same year. Meanwhile, it received a charter from the [[Governor-General of the Philippines]], allowing the college to confer associate degrees in commerce.<ref name='centennial 1910'>{{cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history.html | title = History: 1910 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-15}}</ref> It started offering the degree as a two-year program in 1920.<ref name='centennial 1920'>{{cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history/1920.html | title = History: 1920 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-15}}</ref>

The college already had 425 students by 1921. Due to the lack of space in the Paco campus, and the growing population of its student and faculty, the college moved to its present location in Malate, Manila on February 12.<ref name="centennial 1920"/><ref name="news history"/>

In 1931, the College discontinued its two-year program in commerce in favor of a three-year Bachelor of Science in Commerce program, which was approved a year earlier.<ref name="DLSU history"/><ref name="centennial 1920"/>

===Second World War===

De La Salle College served as a shelter for displaced civilians and wounded soldiers during the Second World War. It was, however, occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]], and made into a defense quarters on January 2, 1942.<ref name="DLSU history"/> Repeated bombings severely damaged the campus. Despite this, classes continued. De La Salle students shared classes with students from other schools that had closed because of the war, while the American Brothers had left. Meanwhile, high school classes were transferred to [[St. Scholastica's College]] in 1943.<ref name='centennial 1940'>{{cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history/1940.html | title = History: 1940 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-15}}</ref><ref name='dlsp 100 years 4'>{{cite web | url = http://100years.lasallian.ph/history/taftavenue.html#page=page-3 | title = Taft Avenue (1921–1945): War comes to Manila | accessdate = 2011-05-15 | publisher=Philippine Lasallian Family}}</ref>

Classes were eventually discontinued. On February 1, 1945, Japanese forces ordered the occupants of the college and the surrounding vicinity to vacate the college. However, [[Egbert Xavier Kelly]], the president of the college, refused. On February 7, Kelly was abducted by the Japanese, and was never found again; he is believed to have been tortured and killed. Around 20 Japanese soldiers came to the campus on February 12 shortly after noontime, and [[De La Salle Brothers in the Philippines#The February 12, 1945 massacre|massacred]] 16 of the 17 Brothers residing in the campus, along with 25 other residents.<ref name="DLSU history"/> Only one Brother (Antonius von Jesus) and 21 other civilians survived the event.<ref name='news 2401'>{{cite journal | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/2401/20080211.pdf | title= Our Martyrs | author=Andrew Gonzales FSC | author2 = Alejandro T.

===Post-war period===

Classes resumed in July 1945, with a class of incoming freshmen that was composed of 60 high school graduates. One year later, the College of Commerce reopened with its 3-year BS Commerce program extended to 4-year program.<ref name="DLSU history"/><ref name="centennial 1940"/> Later, the High School Department of De La Salle College was dissolved in 1968.<ref name="centennial 1960"/> The college, together with [[Ateneo de Manila University]] and the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]], gave birth to the [[Asian Institute of Management]] in the same year with assistance from the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Harvard University]].<ref name='centennial 1960'>{{cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history/1960.html | title = History: 1960 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-15}}</ref><ref name='AIM'>{{Cite web | url = http://www.aim.edu/index.php/historical-highlights.html | title = History | publisher=Asian Institute of Management | accessdate = 2011-05-15}}</ref> Several other units were established in the following years.

The 1970s marked substantial developments for De La Salle College. For instance, it started admitting female students in 1973.<ref name="centennial 1960"/> On February 19, 1975, De La Salle College was granted university status.

[[File:Miguel Hall.jpg|thumb|200px|left|St Miguel Hall (formerly St Benilde Hall)]]

The 1980s were also significant for the institution. In 1981, De La Salle University shifted from the traditional [[academic calendar|semestral academic calendar]] to a trimestral one.<ref name="DLSU history"/> In 1987, the university, together with four other Lasallian institutions, became part of the De La Salle University System.<ref name='centennial 1980'>{{cite web | url = http://centennial.dlsu.edu.ph/celebration/history/1980.html | title = History: 1980 | publisher=De La Salle University | accessdate = 2011-05-16}}</ref> The system would later be dissolved in favor of De La Salle Philippines, a network of 18 Lasallian institutions.

The campus, which is relatively small in size for its large student population, suffers from limited space. According to ''The LaSallian'' each student had only {{convert|7.1|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} for himself in 2009. Crowding is expected to only get worse as the university's population has been continuously growing with the growth for 2008–2009 amounting to 27.7 percent. It has also expressed concerns regarding [[fire safety]], citing possible evacuation difficulties should a fire occur at the Br. Andrew Gonzalez Hall, and accessibility issues for [[fire truck]]s given the lack of wide roads to major buildings. At least three [[conflagration|fires]] have occurred in the campus, including two at St. Joseph Hall.<ref name='conflagration'>{{cite news | url = http://thelasallian.com/2010/11/21/i-don’t-want-to-die/ | title = I don’t want to die | author=Audrey Virgula | date = 2010-11-21 | accessdate = 2011-05-17 | newspaper=The LaSallian | location = Manila}}</ref> To address the problem of limited space, DLSU has resolved to [[vertical expansion]].

===Biñan Campus (Science and Technology Complex)===
The [[De La Salle University Science and Technology Complex]] (DLSU-STC) is a satellite campus of De La Salle University (DLSU) located in [[Biñan City]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], Philippines. The 55-hectare campus was built on land donated by the family of the late National Artist for Architecture [[Leandro Locsin]]. It was originally known as [[De La Salle Canlubang]] (DLSC), a district school of De La Salle Philippines that provided science and technology-based primary, secondary, and tertiary education. In 2012, the administrations of DLSU and DLSC approved the integration of DLSC into DLSU, becoming the DLSU Science and Technology Complex.

Currently, only {{convert|0.6|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of DLSC's campus is developed. Under the proposal, DLSU would expand the Colleges of Engineering, [[De La Salle University College of Computer Studies|Computer Studies]], and [[De La Salle University College of Science|Science]] to DLSC's campus due to its location inside the Laguna Technopark.<ref name="chancellor message">{{Cite web | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/announcements/default.asp?id=2166 | title = DLSU-DLSC Proposed Merger | publisher=De La Salle University | date = 2011-02-14 | author=Br.

===Makati Campus===
The Makati Campus is an extension campus of DLSU located in [[RCBC Plaza]], [[Ayala Avenue]], [[Makati City]], Philippines. The campus primarily serves the university's graduate business students.

===Ortigas Campus===
In 2011, the Ortigas Campus of DLSU Ramon V. Del Rosario College of Business moved from [[La Salle Green Hills]] in [[Mandaluyong City]] to [[Ortigas Center|Ortigas Business District]]. The extension campus is located at the Wynsum Corporate Plaza, [[Ortigas Center]], [[Pasig City]], Philippines.

===Bonifacio Global City Campus===
In September 2013, the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] (BCDA) has awarded to De La Salle University the lease and development of a 1,395 square-meter institutional lot in [[Bonifacio Global City]] in Taguig City.
