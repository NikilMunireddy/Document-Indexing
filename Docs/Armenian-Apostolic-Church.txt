The '''Armenian Apostolic Church''' ({{lang-hy|Հայ Առաքելական Եկեղեցի, ''Hay Aṙak’elakan Yekeghetsi''}}){{efn|Officially {{lang-hy|Հայաստանեայց Առաքելական Սուրբ Եկեղեցի}}, ''Hayastaniayts Aṙak̕elakan Surb Yekeghetsi''}} is the [[national church]] of the [[Armenian people]]. It is part of [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and is one of the most ancient [[Christianity|Christian]] communities.<ref>The Antiquities of the Christian Church – Page 466 by Johann Christian Wilhelm Augusti, Georg Friedrich Heinrich Rheinwald, Carl Christian Friedrich Siegel</ref> [[Armenia]] is an [[Early centers of Christianity#Armenia|early center of Christianity]], and it was the first country to adopt Christianity as its official religion in the early 4th century (traditionally in 301 AD), by establishing this church.<ref>{{cite book|first=René|last=Grousset|title=Histoire de l'Arménie|publisher=Payot|year=1947|edition=1984|page=122}}. Estimated dates vary from 284 to 314. Garsoïan (''op.cit.'' p.82), following the research of Ananian, favours the latter.</ref> The church claims to have originated in the missions of Apostles [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] and [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]] in the First Century.

It is sometimes referred to as the '''Armenian Orthodox Church''' or '''Gregorian Church'''. The latter is not preferred by the church itself, as it views the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus as its founders, and [[Gregory the Illuminator|St. Gregory the Illuminator]] as merely the first official governor of the church. It is also simply known as the '''Armenian Church'''.

===Origins===
[[Image:Tiridates III of Armenia-Baptism.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Baptism of [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]].]]
The Armenian Church claims [[apostolic succession]] through the apostles [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]] and [[Jude the Apostle|Thaddeus]].<ref name="Gilman">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGpr2KsbS94C|title=Christians in Asia before 1500|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Jacob">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3JAwAQAAMAAJ|title=A Brief Historical Sketch of the Holy Apostolic Church of Armenia|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="Issaverdenz">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UuvefaWK948C|title=The Armenian Church|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>  According to legend, the latter of the two apostles is said to have cured [[Abgar V]] of [[Osroene|Edessa]] of leprosy with the [[Image of Edessa]], leading to his conversion in 30 AD. Thaddaeus was then commissioned by Abgar to proselytize throughout Armenia, where he converted the king [[Sanatruk]]'s daughter, who was eventually [[martyr]]ed alongside Thaddeus when Sanatruk later fell into [[apostasy]]. After this, Bartholomew came to Armenia, bringing a portrait of the virgin [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], which he placed in a [[nun]]nery he founded over a former temple of [[Anahit]]. Bartholomew then converted the sister of Sanatruk, who once again martyred a female relative and the apostle who converted her. Both apostles ordained native bishops before their execution, and some other Armenians had been ordained outside of Armenia by [[James, brother of Jesus|James the Just]].<ref name="Jacob" /><ref name="Issaverdenz" />

According to [[Eusebius]] and [[Tertullian]], Armenian Christians were persecuted by kings [[Axidares of Armenia|Axidares]], [[Khosrov I of Armenia|Khosrov I]], and [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]], the last of whom was converted to Christianity by [[Gregory the Illuminator]].<ref name="Gilman" />  [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Ancient Armenia's]] adoption of [[Christianity]] as a [[state religion]] (the first state to do so) has been referred to [[Nina Garsoïan]] as "probably the most crucial step in its history."<ref name="Garsoïan">"The Aršakuni Dynasty (A.D. 12-[180?]-428)" by Nina Garsoïan, in ''Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times'', ed.

King Trdat IV made Christianity the state religion in Armenia between 301 and 314, it was not an entirely new religion in Armenia. It penetrated into the country from at least the third century, but may have been present even earlier.<ref name="maarten">{{cite journal|last1=Theo Maarten van Lint|title=The Formation of Armenian Identity in the First Millenium|journal=Church History and Religious Culture|date=2009|volume=Vol. 89, No. 1/3,|page=269}}</ref>

Tiridates declared Gregory to be the first ''[[Catholicos]]'' of the Armenian Church and sent him to Caesarea to be consecrated. Upon his return, Gregory tore down shrines to idols, built churches and monasteries, and ordained many [[priest]]s and [[bishop]]s. While meditating in the old capital city of Vagharshapat, Gregory had a vision of Christ's coming to the earth to strike it with a hammer. From the spot rose a great Christian temple with a huge cross. He was convinced that God intended him to build the main Armenian church there. With the king's help, he did so, along the lines of his vision. He renamed the city [[Etchmiadzin]], which means "the place of the descent of the only-begotten".<ref>See Drasxanakertci, ''History of Armenia'', 78ff; Atiya, ''History of Eastern Christianity'', 316ff; Narbey, ''A Catechism of Christian Instruction According to the Doctrine of the Armenian Church'', 88ff.</ref>

Initially the Armenian church participated in the larger church world. Its Catholicos was represented at the [[First Council of Nicea]] (325) and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] (381). Although unable to attend the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] (431), the Catholicos Isaac Parthiev sent a message agreeing with its decisions.<ref>Narbey, ''A Catechism of Christian Instruction According to the Doctrine of the Armenian Church'', 86–87.</ref>

The Armenian Church began to distance itself from the Roman concept of the Universal Church when, in 373, King [[Pap of Armenia|Papas (Pap)]] appointed Catholicos [[St. Husik I|Husik]] without first sending him to Caesarea for commissioning.<ref>Drasxanakertci, ''History of Armenia'', 86–87.</ref> Christianity was strengthened in Armenia in the 5th century by the translation of the [[Bible]] into the [[Armenian language]] by the native [[theologian]], [[monk]], and [[scholar]] [[Mesrop Mashtots|St. Mesrob Mashtots]]. Before the 5th century, Armenians had a spoken language, but it was not written. Thus, the Bible and [[Liturgy]] were written in [[Greek language|Greek]] or Syriac rather than Armenian. The Catholicos Sahak commissioned Mesrob to create an Armenian alphabet, which he completed in 406. Subsequently the Bible and Liturgy were translated into Armenian and written in the new script. The translation of the Bible, along with the translation of other works of history, [[literature]] and [[philosophy]], caused a flowering of Armenian literature and a broader cultural renaissance.<ref>Atiya, ''History of Eastern Christianity'', 424-26.</ref>

Unlike the Bible used in other [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Churches]], the Armenian [[Bible]] originally had 39 books in the [[Old testament|Old Testament]]. What are commonly called the [[Apocrypha]] or [[Deuterocanonical]] books were not translated until the 8th century and not read in the churches until the 12th century.<ref>W. St. Clair Tisdall, "Armenian Versions of the Bible," in ''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' (Ed. James Orr; Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 1915).</ref>

===Independence===
At the First Council of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] in 506 the synod of the Armenian, Georgian, and Caucasian Albanian bishops were assembled during the reign of Catholicos Babken I. The participation of the Catholicoi of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] were set to make clear the position of the churches concerning the [[Council of Chalcedon]]. The "Book of Epistles" mentions that 20 bishops, 14 laymen, and many [[nakharar]]s (rulers of Armenia) participated in the council. The involvement in the council discussion of different level of lay persons seemed to be a general rule in Armenia.

Almost a century later (609–610) the 3rd Council of Dvin was convened during the reign of Catholicos [[Abraham I of Aghbatank]] and Prince [[Smbat Bagratuni]], with clergymen and laymen participating. The Georgian Church disagreed with the Armenian Church having approved the christology of Chalcedon. This council was convened to clarify the relationship between the Armenian and Georgian churches. After the Council, Catholicos Abraham wrote an encyclical letter addressed to the people, blaming Kurion and his adherents for the schism. The Council never set up canons; it only deprived Georgians from taking [[Eucharist|Communion]] in the Armenian Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/35284/Armenian-Apostolic-Church|title=Armenian Apostolic Church|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref><ref>http://66.208.37.78/index.jsp?sid=1&id=4094&pid=59&lng=en</ref> Despite this, the Albanian Church remained under the jurisdiction of the Armenian Church while in communion with the Georgian Church.

==Miaphysitism versus monophysitism==
Like all [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches, the [[Armenia]]n Church has been referred to as [[monophysitism|monophysite]] by both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] theologians because it rejected the decisions of the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which condemned the belief of one incarnate nature of Christ (monophysis). The Armenian Church officially severed ties with [[Patriarch of Rome|Rome]] and [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople]] in 554, during the Second Council of [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] where the Chalcedonian [[dyophysite]] christological formula was rejected.

However, again like other [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches,<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ninesaintsethiopianorthodoxmonastery.org/id21.html | title =THE ISSUE BETWEEN MONOPHYSITISM AND DYOPHYSITISM | author = | date = | work = | publisher = Nine Saints Ethiopian Orthodox Monastery | accessdate = 28 January 2011}}</ref> the Armenian Orthodox Church argues that the identification as "monophysitism" is an incorrect description of its position.<ref name = "Ecumenical Councils">{{cite web | url =http://www.armenianchurch.org/index.jsp?sid=1&id=4093&pid=59 | title =Ecumenical Councils | author = | date = | work = | publisher = Official website of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin | accessdate = 28 January 2011}}</ref> It considers Monophysitism, as taught by [[Eutyches]] and condemned at Chalcedon, a heresy and only disagrees with the formula defined by the Council of Chalcedon.<ref name = "Ecumenical Councils"/> The Armenian Church instead adheres to the doctrine defined by [[Cyril of Alexandria]], considered as a saint by the [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedonian Churches]] as well, who described Christ as being of one incarnate nature, where both divine and human nature are united (miaphysis). To distinguish this from [[Eutychian]] and other versions of Monophysitism this position is called [[miaphysitism]]. Whereas the prefix "mono" means "only", thus emphasising the singular nature of Christ, "mia", simply means "one" unemphatically, and allows for a compound nature.

In recent times, both Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian churches have developed a deeper understanding for each other's positions, recognizing their substantial agreement while maintaining their respective theological language.

== Structure and leadership ==
[[Image:Armenian Church Structure.jpg|thumb|left|Procession of Armenian Priests.]]
{{Eastern Christianity}}

The Armenian Apostolic Church is the central religious authority for the Armenian Orthodox population in the [[Republic of Armenia]] as well as for Armenian Orthodox communities worldwide.

It is headed by a ''[[Catholicos]]'' (the plural is ''Catholicoi''). Although it is traditional in Eastern churches for the supreme head of the church to be named '[[Patriarch]]', in the Armenian Apostolic Church hierarchy, the position of the Catholicos is higher than that of the Patriarch. The Armenian Apostolic Church presently has two catholicoi ([[Karekin II]], Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, and [[Aram I]], Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia), and two patriarchs, plus primates, [[archbishop]]s and bishops, lower clergy and laity serving the Church.

Both clergy and lay are involved in the administrative structure of the Church. Led by Karekin II, the spiritual and administrative work of the Armenian Church is carried out in the Republic of Armenia in the areas of religion, preparation of clergy, Christian education, construction of new churches, social services, and ecumenical activities. Underneath this administrative structure are the hierarchical sees:

The [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia]] located in [[Antelias]], [[Lebanon]], is led by Catholicos Aram I and it has dioceses in the countries of the Middle East, in Europe and in North and South America.

The [http://armenian-patriarchate.com/ Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem] which has jurisdiction over all of the Holy Lands and the Diocese of [[Jordan]], is led by Patriarch Archbishop [[Nourhan Manougian]].

The [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] and All of Turkey, which has jurisdiction in the modern day Republic of Turkey, is led by Patriarch Archbishop [[Mesrob II Mutafyan of Constantinople|Mesrob Mutafyan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://66.208.37.78/index.jsp?sid=1&id=7746&pid=3 |title=The Armenian Church}}</ref>

The three historic aforementioned hierarchal sees administer to the Dioceses under their jurisdiction as they see fit, however, the supremacy of the Catholicosate of All Armenians in all spiritual matters remains pre-eminent.
[[File:Armenian Church Madras.jpg|thumb|[[Armenian Church, Chennai|Armenian Church]] in [[Madras]], India, constructed in 1712]]

In addition to the responsibilities of overseeing their respective Dioceses, each hierarchical See, and the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, has a Monastic Brotherhood.

===Seminaries===

The Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin operates two [[seminary|seminaries]], the [[Gevorkian Theological Seminary]] at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, and the [[Vaskenian Theological Academy]] at Lake Sevan. Over a 6-year course of simultaneous study, students receive both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in Theology. The Great House of Cilicia operates one seminary, the Seminary of Antelias at [[Bikfaya]], Lebanon. Upon graduation, students receive the equivalent of a high school diploma and pre-graduate theological study.

The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem operates the St. Tarkmanchatz School (high school diploma) and the Theological Seminary of the Patriarchate; upon graduation students receive their diploma in theology and other subjects.

The Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople had its own seminary, the Holy Cross Patriarchal Seminary, which was shut down by Turkish authorities in Turkey along with all other private schools of higher education.

[http://www.stnersess.edu St. Nersess Armenian Seminary] in New Rochelle, NY also trains Armenian priests, awarding the Master of Divinity in Theology (through an affiliation with nearby OCA [[St. Vladimir's Seminary]]).  St. Nersess also offers a Master of Arts in Armenian Christian Studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stnersess.edu|title=St. Nersess Armenian Seminary|work=St. Nersess Armenian Seminary|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

===Structure===
[[File:Bishop Sebouh - Washing of Feet.jpg|thumb|Archbishop [[Sebouh Chouldjian]] washing the feet of children during the [[Washing of Feet]] ceremony]]
Regionally, each area of the world where the Armenian Church and faithful are located has [[diocese]]s, which are led by a primate from the Diocesan headquarters. Each diocese is made up of parishes and smaller communities.

The spiritual and administrative bodies representing the authority of the Armenian Church are the following:

The '''National Ecclesiastical Assembly''' is the supreme legislative body presided over by the Catholicos of All Armenians. The members of the National Ecclesiastical Assembly are elected by the individual Diocesan Assemblies. The National Ecclesiastical Assembly elects the Catholicos of All Armenians.

The '''Council of Bishops''' is an administrative-deliberative body presided over by the Catholicos of All Armenians. It makes suggestions on the dogmatic, religious, church, parish and canonical issues to be discussed as agenda items during the National Ecclesiastical Assembly.

The '''Supreme Spiritual Council''' is the highest executive body of the Armenian Church and is presided over by the Catholicos of All Armenians. The members of the Council can be elected by the National Ecclesiastical Assembly or appointed by the Catholicos of All Armenians. The Catholicos of All Armenians, Gevorg V. Soorenian established the Supreme Spiritual Council on January 1, 1924, to replace the Synod of Bishops.

The '''Diocesan Assembly''' is the highest legislative (canonical) body of each Diocese and is headed by the Primate of the Diocese. The Diocesan delegates (representatives of each parish community) elect the delegates to the National Ecclesiastical Assembly, the members of the Diocesan Council as well as discuss and decide on administrative issues within the Diocese such as committees, budgets, building, etc. In some Dioceses, the Diocesan Assembly elects the Primate of the Diocese.

The '''Diocesan Council''' is the highest executive power of a diocese, presided over by the Primate of the Diocese. It regulates the inner administrative activity of the Diocese under the direction of the Primate. The Diocesan Assembly elects members of the Diocesan Council.

The '''Monastic Brotherhood''' consists of the [[celibate]] clergy of the [[monastery]] who are led by an [[abbot]]. As of 2010, there were three brotherhoods in the Armenian Church – the brotherhood of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, the brotherhood of St. James at the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem and the brotherhood of the See of Cilicia. Each Armenian celibate priest becomes a member of the brotherhood in which he has studied and ordained in or under the jurisdiction of which he has served. The brotherhood makes decisions concerning the inner affairs of the monastery. Each brotherhood elects two delegates who take part in the National Ecclesiastical Assembly.

The '''Parish Assembly''' is the general assembly of the community presided over by the spiritual pastor. The Parish Assembly elects or appoints the members of the Parish Council and the representatives or delegates to the Diocesan Assembly.

The '''Parish Council''' is the executive-administrative body of the community. It is presided over by the spiritual pastor of the community who takes up the inner administrative affairs of the parish and is engaged in the realization of its administrative and financial activities. Members of the parish council are elected or appointed at the parish assembly.

The Armenian Apostolic Church is one of a few apostolic churches in the world to have a democratic system; the people decide if they want to keep priests in their churches and may ask for different ones, as do some other ecclesiastical constitutions, such as [[Baptists]] and other [[Congregational]] churches.

Note that the Armenian Apostolic Church should not be confused, however, with the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] whose Patriarch-Catholicos (of the Armenian Catholic Rite) is [[Nerses Bedros XIX]], which is an [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic church]] in communion with the [[Holy See]] in [[Rome]].

===Two Catholicosates===
The Armenian Apostolic Church currently has two Sees, with the [[Catholicos of All Armenians]] residing in [[Etchmiadzin]], [[Armenia]], at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, having pre-eminent supremacy in all spiritual matters over the [[See of Cilicia]], located in [[Antelias, Lebanon]], which administers to the dioceses under its jurisdiction as they see fit. The two Sees are as follows:

====Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin====
[[File:Etchmiadzin Cathedral view.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]], Armenia's Mother Church]]

The [[Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin]] ({{lang-hy|Մայր Աթոռ Սուրբ Էջմիածին }}) is the spiritual and administrative headquarters of the worldwide Armenian Church, the center of the faith of the Armenian nation – the Mother Cathedral of the Armenian Church, and the Pontifical residence of Karekin II.  The Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin is a blend of the past, present and future of the worldwide Armenian Church.

Preserving the past are the numerous museums, libraries and the Mother Cathedral itself, all holding a vast richness of history and treasures.  The Mother See is responsible for the preservation of artifacts, both those created by the Church and those given to the church as gifts over time.

Carrying on the work of the present and future are the innumerable departments and programs of the Armenian Church. Under the leadership and guidance of Karekin II, the Mother See administers to social, cultural and educational programs for Armenia and the Diaspora.

The Mother Cathedral is the most recognised landmark of the Armenian Church. Built and consecrated by St. [[Gregory the Illuminator]] and [[Tiridates III of Armenia|St. Trdat the Great]] in AD 303, the Cathedral is located in the city of [[Vagharshapat, Armenia]].

It is said that St. Gregory chose the location of the Cathedral in accordance with a vision. In his dream he saw "Miatsin", the Only Begotten Son of God, with glittering light on his face descending from the Heavens and with a golden hammer striking the ground where the Cathedral was to be located. Hence comes the name "Etchmiadzin", which translates literally to "the place" where Miatsin descended.

The Mother Cathedral is open every day; [[Divine Liturgy]] is celebrated every Sunday.

====Great House of Cilicia====
[[Image:Antelias - Armeni.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral'' (1940) in [[Antelias]], Lebanon]]The [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia]] ({{lang-hy|Կաթողիկոսութիւն Հայոց  Մեծի Տանն Կիլիկիոյ }}) located in [[Antelias]], [[Lebanon]], is a regional See of the Armenian Apostolic Church and is an autonomous church with jurisdiction over certain segments of the [[Armenian diaspora]].

{{As of|2012}} Catholicos [[Aram I]] was the head and Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia. The See has jurisdiction over prelacies in Lebanon, [[Syria]], [[Cyprus]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]], the Persian Gulf, the United States, [[Canada]] and [[Venezuela]]. In the United States, Canada, Syria, and Greece there are also Dioceses that are related to the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, so there is duality of representation of the Armenian Apostolic churches in these countries.

The primacy of the Catholicosate of All Armenians (Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin) has always been recognized by the Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia.

The history of the Great House of Cilicia as an autocephalous church is as follows: after the fall of Ani and the Armenian Kingdom of the Bagradits in 1045, masses of Armenians migrated to [[Cilicia]] and the Catholicossate settled there. The seat of the church (now known as the Catholicossate of the Great House of Cilicia) was first established in [[Sivas]] (AD 1058) moving to Tavbloor (1062), then to Dzamendav (1066), Dzovk (1116), [[Hromgla]] (1149), and finally to [[Kozan, Adana|Sis]] (1293), then-capital of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]]. Beginning in 1293 and continuing for more than six centuries, the city of Sis (modern-day [[Kozan, Adana]], Turkey) was the center of the Catholicossate of the Great House of Cilicia.

After the fall of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], in 1375, the Church continued in its leadership role in the Armenian community, and the Catholicos was recognized as Ethnarch (Head of Nation).

In 1441 Kirakos I Virapetsi of Armenia was elected Catholicos in Holy [[Etchmiadzin]]. At the same time the residing Catholicos in Sis, [[Gregory IX of Cilicia|Gregory IX Mousabegian]] (1439–1446), remained as [[List of Armenian Catholicoi of Cilicia|Catholicos of Cilicia]].  Since 1441, there have continued to be two Catholicossates in the Armenian Church, each having rights and privileges, and each with its own jurisdiction.

During the [[First World War]] and the 1915 [[Armenian Genocide]], the Armenian population and the home of the Catholicossate at the Monastery of St. Sophia of Sis (which can be seen to dominate the town in early 20th-century photographs), was destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://net.lib.byu.edu/~rdh7/wwi/1915/bryce/a14.htm#XV|title=Documents 119-129. Bryce. Armenians. XV---Cicilia (Vilayet of Adan and Sankjak of Marash).|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>
The last residing Catholicos in Sis was [[Sahag II of Cilicia]] (Catholicos from 1902 to 1939), who followed his Armenian flock into exile from Turkey.

Since 1930, the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Catholicosate of the Great House of Cilicia]] has been headquartered in [[Antelias]], [[Lebanon]].

====Reasons for the division====
The division of the two Catholicossates stemmed from frequent relocations of Church headquarters due to political and military upheavals.

The division between the two sees intensified during the [[USSR|Soviet]] period and to some extent reflected the politics of the [[Cold War]].  The [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (ARF) Dashnaktsutyun social democratic political party that had dominated the independent Republic of Armenia from 1918 to 1920 and was active in the diaspora, saw the Church and clergy, with its worldwide headquarters at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin in the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Republic of Armenia]], as a captive Communist puppet, and accused its clergy in the US as unduly influenced by Communists, particularly as the clergy were reluctant to participate in nationalist events and memorials that could be perceived as anti-Soviet.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Minassian|first=Oshagan|title = A History of the Armenian Holy Apostolic Orthodox Church in the United States|version = PhD Dissertation|year = 1974|format=PDF|url= http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=760840991&sid=1&Fmt=1&clientId=19680&RQT=309&VName=PQD (subscription required)  |accessdate = 2009-06-22 }}</ref> On December 24, 1933, a group of assassins attacked Eastern Diocese Archbishop [[Levon Tourian]] as he walked down the aisle of [[Holy Cross Armenian Apostolic Church (New York City)|Holy Cross Armenian Church]] in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of New York City during the Divine Liturgy, and killed him with a butcher's knife.  Nine ARF members were later arrested, tried and convicted.  The incident divided the Armenian community, as ARF sympathizers established congregations independent of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, declaring loyalty instead to the See based in Antelias in Lebanon.  The division was formalized in 1956 when the Antelias (Cilisian) See broke away from the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin See.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Alexander|first = Ben|url= http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jaeh/27.1/alexander.html|title = Contested Memories, Divided Diaspora: Armenian Americans, the Thousand-day Republic, and the Polarized Response to an Archbishop's Murder|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 27|issue = 1|year=2007}}</ref>

The separation has become entrenched in the United States, with most large Armenian communities having two parish churches, one answering to each See, even though they are theologically indistinguishable. There have been numerous lay and clergy efforts at reunion, especially since the fall of the Soviet Union.

In 1995, Karekin II, Catholicos of Cilicia for the period 1983–1994, was elected Catholicos of All Armenians in the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin upon the death of [[Vazgen I]], becoming [[Karekin I]] Catholicos of All Armenians, and serving as Supreme head of the church until 1999.  He was not able, however, to unite the two Catholicossates, despite having headed both.

===Two Patriarchates: Constantinople and Jerusalem===
The Armenian Apostolic Church also has two Patriarchates of high authority both under the jurisdiction of the [[Catholicos of All Armenians]]. They are:

*[[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]] ({{lang-hy|Առաքելական Աթոռ Սրբոց Յակովբեանց Յերուսաղեմ literally Apostolic Seat of St. James in Jerusalem}}) in the [[Armenian Quarter]] of [[Jerusalem]] headed since 2013 by the Patriarch of Jerusalem Archbishop [[Nourhan Manougian]]
*[[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in Istanbul, Turkey ({{lang-hy|Պատրիարքութիւն Հայոց Կոստանդնուպոլսոյ}}) headed since 1998 by Patriarch of Constantinople Archbishop [[Mesrob II Mutafyan of Constantinople|Mesrob II Mutafyan]].  In July 2010, the spiritual council of Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople approved the candidacy of Archbishop Aram Ateshyan to serve as Patriarchal Vicar of the Patriarchate.  In July 2008, it was announced that Mesrob Mutafyan was suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and had withdrawn from all his duties and from public life, but would be patriarch and archbishop all his life.

== Comparison to other churches ==
[[Liturgy|Liturgically]] speaking, the Church has much in common both with the [[Latin Rite]] in its externals, especially as it was at the time of separation, as well as with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. For example, Armenian bishops wear [[mitre]]s almost identical to those of Western bishops. They usually do not use a full [[iconostasis]], but rather a sanctuary veil (a curtain usually with a cross or divine image in the center, used also by the Syriac Churches). The liturgical music is [[Armenian chant]]. Many of the Armenian churches also have [[pipe organs]] to accompany their chant.

Armenian priests below the rank of bishop are allowed to be married before ordination and their descendants' surnames are prefixed with the prefix "Der" (or "Ter" in Eastern Armenian), meanings "Lord", to indicate their lineage. Such a married priest is known as a ''kahana''.

The Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates the [[Nativity of Jesus]] in combination with the [[Feast of the Epiphany]], putting Armenian Christmas on 6 January in the church's calendar.  This contrasts with the more common celebration of [[Christmas]] on 25 December, originally a Western Christian tradition, which Armenia only briefly adopted before reverting to its original practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armenianchurch.net/worship/christmas/index.htm|title=Armenian Church|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>

Since 1923, the church has mainly used the [[Gregorian Calendar]] shared by most civil authorities and Western Christian churches (not the traditional [[Armenian calendar]]).  The only exception is the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, where the old [[Julian calendar]] is used, putting Nativity celebrations on 19 January in the Gregorian calendar.<ref>http://www.churcharmenia.com/evangelical/evmain3_30_01b.html</ref>

The Armenian Apostolic Church are distinct from the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], the latter being a ''[[sui juris]]'' [[Eastern Catholic Church]], part of the [[Catholic Church]]. When in the 1740s, Abraham-Pierre I Ardzivian, who had earlier become a Catholic, was elected as the patriarch of [[Kozan, Adana|Sis]] in the 1740s, he led part of the Armenian Apostolic Church into [[full communion]] with the [[Pope]] and the [[Armenian Catholic Church]] was created.

==Women in the Armenian Church==
The Armenian Church does not ordain women to the priesthood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiwa-net.org/Karekin.html|title=Ambitious International Women's Association|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}</ref>  Historically, however,  monastic women have been ordained as deacons within a convent environment.<ref>

</ref> While they are truly ordained, these women deacons do not minister in traditional parish churches or cathedrals to lay worshippers.<ref>
{{cite journal|last = Zagano|first = Phyllis|title = Catholic women's ordination: the ecumenical implications of women deacons in the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Orthodox Church of Greece, and the Union of Utrecht Old Catholic Churches|journal = Journal of Ecumenical Studies|volume=43|issue=1|pages=124–137|year=2008|url=http://journal.jesdialogue.org/back_issues/volume_43_2008/|issn=0022-0558}}</ref>

Women are generally not allowed at the altar of the Armenian church, although in practice exceptions are made to allow for altar girls and lay readers, especially when a parish is so small that not enough boys or men are regularly available to serve.

Women commonly serve the church in the choir and at the organ, on parish councils, as volunteers for church events, fundraisers, and Sunday schools, as supporters through Women's Guilds, and as staff members in church offices.

In the case of a married priest (Der Hayr), the wife of the priest generally plays an active role in the parish and is addressed by the title Yeretzgin.

In limited circumstances, the Armenian Church allows for divorce and remarriage.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} Cases usually include either adultery or apostasy.

==Armenian genocide victims canonization==
On April 23, 2015, the Armenian Apostolic Church [[canonization|canonized]] all the victims of the [[Armenian Genocide]]; this service is believed to be the largest canonization service in history.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davlashyan |first=Naira |url=http://news.yahoo.com/armenian-church-canonise-1-5-million-genocide-victims-075841925.html |title=Armenian Church makes saints of 1.5 million genocide victims - Yahoo News |publisher=News.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/eng/news/191101/ |title=Armenian Genocide victims canonized in Holy Etchmiadzin |publisher=Panarmenian.Net |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armenianow.com/genocide/62740/armenia_genocide_martyrs_victims_canonization_church_echmiadzin |title=Canonized: Armenian Church proclaims collective martyrdom of Genocide victims - Genocide |publisher=ArmeniaNow.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23}}</ref> It was the first canonization by the Armenian Apostolic Church in four hundred years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://risu.org.ua/en/index/all_news/orthodox/armenian_ac/59027/ |title=After 400 years, new saints for the Armenian Church |publisher=Risu.org.ua |date= |accessdate=2015-04-23}}</ref>

==Current state==

=== In the Republic of Armenia ===
[[File:2014 Erywań, Katedra św. Grzegorza Oświeciciela (05).jpg|thumb|[[Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, Yerevan|Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral in Yerevan]] is the largest Armenian church in the world]]
The status of the Armenian Apostolic Church within the Republic of Armenia is defined in the country's constitution. Article 8.1 of the Constitution of Armenia states: "The Republic of Armenia recognizes the exclusive historical mission of the Armenian Apostolic Holy Church as a national church, in the spiritual life, development of the national culture and preservation of the national identity of the people of Armenia." Among others, ethnographer [[Hranush Kharatyan]] has questioned the constitutionality of the phrase "national church".<ref>{{cite web|title=Կրոն և աղանդ. Հովհաննես Հովհաննիսյան, Հրանուշ Խառատյան|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0YoJwgRqsI|publisher=Boon TV on [[YouTube]]|language=hy|date=7 February 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, further constitutional amendments were drafted that would make it a crime for non-traditional religious groups to proselytize on adherents of the Apostolic Church. Minority groups would also be banned from spreading 'distrust' in other faiths.<ref>Tigran Avetisian, "U.S. Again Highlights `Restrictions' On Religious Freedom In Armenia" RFE/RL Armenia Report – 11/19/2010</ref> These draft amendments were put on hold after strong criticism voiced by the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Armenian
religious minorities and human rights groups also expressed serious concern over the amendments, with human rights activist Stepan Danielian stating "the Armenian Apostolic Church today wants to have a monopoly on religion". The Armenian Church defines religious groups operating outside its domain as "sects" and, in the words of spokesman Bishop Arshak Khachatrian, considers that "their activities in Armenia are nothing but a denial of the creed of the Armenian Apostolic Church, which is considered the national religion of the Armenian people". [[Hrant Bagratyan]], former Prime Minister of Armenia, condemned the close association of the Armenian Apostolic Church with the Armenian government, calling the Church an "untouchable" organisation that is secretive of its income and expenditure.<ref>[http://www.epress.am/FNew.aspx?nid=11293 "No Separation of Church and State in Armenia?"] epress.am article, 23-12-2010.</ref>

=== In Nagorno-Karabakh (Artsakh) ===
{{main|Diocese of Artsakh}}
Due to the [[Bolshevik revolution]] and the subsequent annexation of Armenia by the U.S.S.R., all functioning religious institutions in Armenia and NKAO were closed down, and their clergymen either exiled or shot. After a while the Armenian Apostolic Church resumed its activities.  There were weddings, baptisms, and every Sunday Church Liturgy at a free will attendance. The Armenian Apostolic Church since 1989 restored or constructed more than 30 churches. In 2009 the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Republic]] government introduced a law entitled "Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organisations", article 8 of which provided that only the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church is allowed to preach on the territory of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. However, the law did make processes available for other religious institutions to get approval from the government if they wished to worship within the Republic.<ref>Naira Hairumyan, "[http://www.armenianow.com/features/9704/karabakh_will_the_new_law_on_relig Karabakh: Will the new law on religion curb the number of sects in Karabakh?]", ArmeniaNow, 24 April 2009.</ref>

=== Armenian diaspora ===
[[File:Armenian Apostolic Prelacy 138 E39 jeh.jpg|thumb|Armenian Apostolic Prelacy, New York]]

Today there are large Armenian Apostolic congregations in various countries in Western Europe, North and South America, and South Asia.  [[Lebanon]], home to a large and influential Armenian diaspora community with its own political parties, has more than 17 recognized Armenian Apostolic churches.  

The Armenian presence in Israel is primarily found in the [[Armenian Quarter]] of Jerusalem, under the jurisdiction of the [[Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem]].

The [[Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in [[Turkey]] and the Armenian Apostolic Church of Iran (see also [[Christians in Iran]]) are important communities in the diaspora. These churches represent the largest Christian ethnic minorities in these predominantly Muslim countries.

The United Kingdom has three Armenian churches: [[St Sarkis, Kensington|St Sarkis]] in [[Kensington]], London; [[Church of St Yeghiche, South Kensington|Saint Yeghiche]] in [[South Kensington]], also in London; and Holy Trinity in [[Manchester]].

Syria has one Armenian church, St Sarkis, in Damascus.

==Historical role and public image==
The Armenian Apostolic Church is "seen by many as the custodian of Armenian national identity".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/35284/Armenian-Apostolic-Church|title=Armenian Apostolic Church|work=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> "Beyond its role as a religious institution, the Apostolic Church has traditionally been seen as the foundational core in the development of the Armenian national identity as God's uniquely chosen people."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Terzian|first1=Shelley|editor1-last=Wolhuter|editor1-first=Charl|editor2-last=de Wet|editor2-first=Corene|title=International Comparative Perspectives on Religion and Education|contribution=Central effects of religious education in Armenia from Ancient Times to Post-Soviet Armenia|date=2014|publisher=AFRICAN SUN MeDIA|isbn=978-1-920382-37-7|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=y4_4AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&dq=Armenian+Apostolic+Church+national+identity 28]}}</ref>

According to a 2014 survey, the church is the most trusted institution in Armenia among the youth (18- to 25-year-olds) with 68.8% expressing trust, while 30.2% expressing distrust.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ter-Stepanyan|first1=Diana|last2=Khachatryan|first2=Edgar|title=Between Freedom and Security: Research Analysis|url=http://www.peacedialogue.am/upload_/3_702/between_freedom_and_security_eng.pdf|publisher=Peace Dialogue NGO|location=Vanadzor, Armenia|page=18|date=2015}}</ref>

==Controversies and criticisms==
Early medieval opponents of the Armenian Church in Armenia included the [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]] (7th-9th centuries) and the [[Tondrakians]] (9th-11th centuries).

Architecture historian [[Samvel Karapetyan (author)|Samvel Karapetyan]] has criticized many aspects of the Armenian Apostolic Church, especially its historical role in Armenian history. Karapetyan particularly denounces, what he calls, Armenian Church's loyal service to foreign invaders: "The Armenian Apostolic Church is a conscientious tax structure, which every conqueror needs."<ref>{{cite web|script-title=hy:«Դավանել հայ առաքելական եկեղեցի՝ նշանակում է փորել սեփական գերեզմանը»|url=http://www.religions.am/arm/interviews/%C2%AB%D4%B4%D5%A1%D5%BE%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%A5%D5%AC-%D5%B0%D5%A1%D5%B5-%D5%A1%D5%BC%D5%A1%D6%84%D5%A5%D5%AC%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%B6-%D5%A5%D5%AF%D5%A5%D5%B2%D5%A5%D6%81%D5%AB%D5%9D-%D5%B6%D5%B7%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B4-%D5%A7-%D6%83%D5%B8%D6%80%D5%A5%D5%AC-%D5%BD%D5%A5%D6%83%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%B6-%D5%A3%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%A5%D5%A6%D5%B4%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%A8%C2%BB/|website=religions.am|language=hy|date=3 April 2014}}</ref>
