The nature of [[international human rights law]] has been dramatically altered by Americans since the [[September 11 attacks|attacks on the twin towers]] on September 11, 2001. The [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] is an example of recent developments that seem to disregard long standing human rights.<ref name="Schneider, D. 2004">Schneider, D. “Human Rights Issues in Guantanamo Bay” 68 (2004) J. Crim. L., 423</ref> The United States of America [[United States of America|(USA)]] has pursued a ‘seemingly deliberate strategy’ to put suspected terrorists outside the reach of habeas corpus protections.<ref>Londras, F. “Guantanamo Bay: Towards Legality?” 71 (2008) Mod. L. Rev, 36, at 1</ref> Guantanamo Bay prison is a United States military prison near [[Cuba]] designed for the detention of non-citizens suspected of terrorist activity. At the time of its creation President Bush stated that its purpose was to respond to serious war crimes, primarily ‘a new way to deal with terrorists'.<ref name="Schneider, D. 2004"/> The first camp was set up 3 months after the attacks on the twin towers and since then a human rights debate has begun over the legality of denying detainees the right to petition [[habeas corpus]].

The detainees at the [[United States]] [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]s, in [[Cuba]] have had over 200 [[habeas corpus|writs of habeas corpus]] submitted on their behalf.

==The Great Writ==
{{main|Habeas corpus}}

Habeas corpus is sometimes called '''"The Great Writ"'''.  It is a legal instrument first guaranteed following the signing of the [[Magna Carta]].  Its literal meaning is '''"show the body"'''.  Its purpose is to prevent the state from holding prisoners in [[extrajudicial detention]]. A writ of habeas corpus essentially challenges the legality of the detention. When a writ of habeas corpus is filed with a court in countries which inherit elements of their judicial system from the English system of Justice the state has to show that there is a legal basis for the captive's detention—usually that they are suspected of having broken a law. The principle of habeas corpus is codified in many humanitarian law treaties and national legislation – the right of fair trial and detainment is considered a basic human right.
The principle of habeas corpus is codified in the [[US Constitution]] in article I(9)(2), commonly known as the ‘Suspension Clause’. This provides that ‘the privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it’.<ref name="Londras, F. 2008">Londras, F. “Guantanamo Bay: Towards Legality?” 71 (2008) Mod. L. Rev, 36</ref>

==Are Guantanamo detainees eligible for the protections of habeas corpus?==
Reports from Guantanamo Bay claim the detainees suffer from ‘extraordinary psychological and physical abuses’.<ref name="ccrjustice.org">{{citation|url=http://ccrjustice.org/learn-more/reports/report:-torture-and-cruel,-inhuman,-and-degrading-treatment-prisoners-guantanamo- |publisher=Center for Constitutional Rights |title=Report on torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba}}</ref> Psychological abuses include solitary confinement for long periods, sleep deprivation and religious abuse. Physical abuse is also used regularly as punishment, reportedly disproportionate for the apparent misconduct. Sami Al-Laithi, a professor at Kabul University who was taken into US custody in Guantanamo has been found to never have been hostile towards US. He was a healthy man when he was first captured by US forces but is now confined to a wheelchair after two vertebrae were broken in vicious beatings in the camp.<ref name="ccrjustice.org"/> Many of these detainees claim that they have been wrongfully detained and deny any involvement in hostile activity towards the USA, or any involvement with the [[Taliban]] or [[Al Qaeda]] at all. Taking into account the inhumane conditions of the camp it is not surprising that Guantanamo detainees have sought protection from the principles of habeas corpus.

The issue is concerned with the jurisdiction of the US Courts to issue the writ of habeas corpus in respect to the detention of aliens which are held outside of the US. Six weeks after the events of September 11 Bush granted the [[Patriot Act|USA Patriot Act]] which restricted the right of habeas corpus to resident aliens, this was done to allow suspected terrorists to be held without legal counsel or trial and avoid the protection of habeas corpus.<ref>Federman, C. “Habeas Corpus in the age of Guantanamo” (2010) Annals Fac. L. Belgrade Belgrade L. Rev., 215, at 224</ref> The third Geneva Convention considers a fair trial so essential to prisoner rights that ‘willfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of a fair and regular trial is deemed a grave brave of the convention and, consequentially, a war crime’.<ref name="ccrjustice.org"/>

In early 2002 the first major petition for a writ of habeas corpus regarding Guantanamo detainees was filed. This was denied on the foundation that U.S courts lacked jurisdiction over the camp and its prisoners; Guantanamo Bay is located in Cuba, outside of the territory of the USA, and the writ of habeas corpus is ‘not available to aliens outside the sovereign territory of the USA’.<ref name="Schneider, D. 2004"/>  The [[Cuban–American Treaty of Relations (1903)|lease of Guantanamo Bay]] to the US on the part of Cuba reads ‘while on one hand the US recognises the continuance of the ultimate sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba….on the other hand the Republic of Cuba consents that…the USA shall exercise complete jurisdiction and control over and within said area’.<ref name="Schneider, D. 2004"/> Early courts claimed that Guantanamo does not technically belong to USA so habeas corpus could not apply. The Combatant Status Review Tribunals [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal|(CSRT)]] was created as an outcome from early petitions for habeas corpus. Its role was to establish whether or not detainees are actually enemy combatants.

However, the most recent case law development has been in the US Supreme Court case ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' where it was established Guantanamo detainees have a right to habeas corpus and are able to bring their petitions to U.S courts. It also held that the Guantanamo detainees were entitled to the legal protections of the US Constitution and from then on, the Combatant Status Review Tribunal would be inadequate. The result of this case has seen many habeas corpus cases refiled.

==Abuses of international human rights law and habeas corpus==
The [[Geneva Conventions]], of which there are four, are considered universal treaties in international law. They created the idea of [[International humanitarian law]] and codify [[customary international law]] regarding laws in wartime. By signing parties agreed to criminalise any breaches in their own domestic courts, U.S recognised this when they enacted their own [[War Crimes Act of 1996|War Crimes Act]]. However the declaration made by Bush in 2002 had the effect of ‘exempting all alleged members of Al Qaeda from the protections of the Geneva conventions’.<ref name="ccrjustice.org"/>

The abuse of international human rights law lies in the treatment of detainees, the absence of public scrutiny, judicial review and government accountability.<ref name="ccrjustice.org"/> The U.S government deliberately chose Guantanamo Bay as the site for detaining foreign citizens as they believed it would be exempt from any obligations they held under the Geneva Convention. Considering detainees as detainees outside the traditional definition of prisoners also denies the protections of the Geneva Convention.  Proof of these deliberate decisions is found in the legal memoranda where President Bush actively enquired about how far they could legally go.<ref name="ccrjustice.org"/>

The scope of international human rights has been discussed in the habeas corpus cases from Guantanamo Bay. Firstly, it should be noted that habeas corpus is a human right of utmost importance, recognised through humanitarian law, for ‘protecting one’s right to physical liberty’.<ref name="Londras, F. 2008 p. 38">Londras, F. “Guantanamo Bay: Towards Legality?” 71 (2008) Mod. L. Rev, 36, at p. 38</ref> It has been suggested that there may almost be universal acceptance that the protections of habeas corpus are ‘non-derogable’.<ref name="Londras, F. 2008 p. 38"/>

Habeas corpus exists outside the Geneva Convention; it is found in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in Article 9; Article 9 of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]; Article 5 of the [[European Convention of Human Rights]]; and, in the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], Article 7. The purpose of the European Convention on Human Rights is to create enforceable rights that States are obliged to respect. Limiting this Convention in order to conduct security operations would undermine the system.<ref>Londras, F. “Guantanamo Bay: Towards Legality?” 71 (2008) Mod. L. Rev, 36, at p. 53</ref>

==Role of the Center for Constitutional Rights==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}

The [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] took a lead role in helping to organize the activities of lawyers willing to offer their services, [[pro bono]], to the Guantanamo detainees.

Submitting writs of habeas corpus was made more difficult at first, because part of the Bush detainee policy was to keep the identity of the Guantanamo captives a secret.  A writ has to be submitted by a '''"next friend"'''.  Some of the detainees had family who would have authorized American lawyers to submit writs on their behalf, but they had no way of contacting them.  Some of the detainees and their relatives are totally illiterate.  Other detainees' families had no idea where they were, had no idea that they were in Guantanamo. Some of the detainees reported that they were punished for asking for legal assistance.

==''Rasul v. Bush''==
In the summer of 2004 the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled on the habeas corpus submission ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'', determining that the court had jurisdiction over Guantanamo, and that detainees had a right to an impartial tribunal to challenge their detention under habeas corpus. It was a landmark decision in detainee rights. ''Rasul v Bush'' challenged an earlier precedent set in ''[[Johnson v. Eisentrager]]''. ''Rasul'' concluded that the U.S, as a lessee, has ‘extensive proprietary rights over Guantanamo Bay’ that were exclusively granted in the 1903 lease.<ref>Londras, F. “Guantanamo Bay: Towards Legality?” 71 (2008) Mod. L. Rev, 36, at p. 42</ref> This lease gave U.S operational sovereignty over the base and brought it within the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction. A related decision was ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2004), which ruled that United States citizens detained as suspected enemy combatants had the right to habeas corpus challenge of their detention.

==Detainee Treatment Act of 2005==
In response to ''Rasul v Bush'', the U.S Government passed the [[Detainee Treatment Act]] 2005 in an attempt to prevent aliens for petitioning for habeas corpus in American courts.<ref name="Federman, C. 2010">Federman, C. “Habeas Corpus in the age of Guantanamo” (2010) Annals Fac. L. Belgrade Belgrade L. Rev., 215</ref>  Section 1005(e) states that “[N]o court, justice, or Judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained at the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba’.<ref>Detainee Treatment Act 2005, s1005(e)(1) 423</ref>

The [[Detainee Treatment Act of 2005]] prohibited US military and intelligence personnel from treating detainees in ways inconsistent with Armed Forces regulations.  Additionally, the act did not close off the habeas corpus submission that were already in the works.

==''Hamdan v. Rumsfeld''==
In ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' (2006), the Supreme Court ruled that the Bush Presidency lacked the [[United States Constitution|Constitutional authority]] to create the [[Guantanamo military commission]]s as a system separate from the existing federal and military justice systems, and ruled that the CSRTs and military commissions were unconstitutional. It said that only Congress could authorize such a system. They confirmed in their judgement the unlawfulness of the US Government in the use of torture, cruel and humiliating treatment, and international law should limit the power of the President.<ref name="ccrjustice.org"/>

''Hamdam v Rumsfeld'' has been acknowledged as a milestone case for Guantanamo detainees; [[Walter E. Dellinger III|Walter Dellinger]] even claimed that ‘Hamdam is simply the most important decision on Presidential power and the rule of law. Ever’.<ref>{{citation|url=http://ccrjustice.org/learn-more/reports/report:-torture-and-cruel,-inhuman,-and-degrading-treatment-prisoners-guantanamo- |publisher=Center for Constitutional Rights |title=Report on torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba |page=14}}</ref> It followed the passing of the Detainee Treatment Act and gave the Supreme Court an ‘early opportunity to assess the nature and extent of the jurisdiction-stripping measure’.<ref>Londras, F. “Guantanamo Bay: Towards Legality?” 71 (2008) Mod. L. Rev, 36, at p. 45</ref> The Supreme Court held that the amendment by the new legislation would not apply to detainees who had cases already waiting to be reviewed.

==Military Commissions Act of 2006==
Once more in response to a judicial decision, Congress passed the [[Military Commission Act of 2006]] swiftly after ''Hamdan v Rumsfeld''. The new section, under section 7, attempted to apply the Detainee Treatment Act to detainees with cases pending.<ref name="Noble, B 2008">Noble, B. Constitutional Law – Habeas Corpus – Guantanamo Bay Detainees are entitles to the privilege of Habeas Corpus under the US Constitution” 39 (2008) Cumb. L. Rev., 341</ref>   This was an attempt by political branch of government to reinforce their opinion that the ‘federal courts should have as little to do with Guantanamo Bay detainees as possible’.<ref>Londras, F. “Guantanamo Bay: Towards Legality?” 71 (2008) Mod. L. Rev, 36, at p. 47</ref>

==The Supreme Court and the Military Commissions Act==
On June 29, 2007 the Supreme Court agreed to hear outstanding habeas corpus, opening up the possibility that they might overturn some or all of the Military Commissions Act.<ref name=TheJurist20070629>

==''Boumediene v. Bush''==
The decision in ''[[Boumediene v. Bush]]'' in 2008 has had huge implications on America’s war on terror.<ref>Boumediene v. Bush, 2008 S. Ct. 2299, 128</ref> It was acknowledged that the Military Commissions Act was retaliation to the decision in Hamdan. ''Boumediene'' ruled that Guantanamo detainees were able to bring about a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in U.S courts and established that the judicial branch of government has the final say on unlawful detentions, rather than the Executive branch as the Bush regime had been implementing.<ref name="Federman, C. 2010"/>

Justice Kennedy, in delivering the majority opinion, held that it was within the U.S court’s jurisdiction to apply a writ of habeas corpus to aliens in Guantanamo bay as the fundamental rights of the U.S Constitution should be extended to Guantanamo detainees.<ref name="Londras, F. 2008"/> Since ''Boumediene'', Bush confirmed that his administration would look into the decision to see if any additional legislation would be ‘appropriate’ in terms of the protection of American people.<ref name="Noble, B 2008"/>
