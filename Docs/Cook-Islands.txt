The '''Cook Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Cook Islands.ogg|ˈ|k|ʊ|k|_|ˈ|aɪ|l|ən|d|z}}; [[Cook Islands Māori]]: ''Kūki 'Āirani''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AT2ENAHoS28C ''Cook Islands Maori dictionary''] by Jasper Buse & Raututi Taringa, Cook Islands Ministry of Education (1995) page 200</ref>) is an [[island country]] in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]] in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]]. It comprises 15 islands whose total land area is {{convert|240|km2|sqmi|1}}. The Cook Islands' [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ), however, covers {{convert|1800000|km2|sqmi}} of ocean.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214035426/http://www.sopac.org/tiki/tiki-index.php?page=Cook+Islands A View from the Cook Islands]. SOPAC</ref>

The Cook Islands' defence and foreign affairs are the responsibility of New Zealand, but they are exercised in consultation with the Cook Islands. In recent times, the Cook Islands have adopted an increasingly independent foreign policy. Although [[Cook Islanders]] are [[New Zealand nationality law|citizens of New Zealand]], they have the status of [[Cook Islander|Cook Islands nationals]], which is not given to other New Zealand citizens.

The Cook Islands' main population centres are on the island of [[Rarotonga]] (10,572 in 2011<ref name=2011census />), where there is an international airport. There is a larger population of Cook Islanders in New Zealand, particularly the [[North Island]]. In the 2006 census, 58,008 self-identified as being of ethnic [[Cook Islands Māori]] descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/census/2006-census-data/quickstats-about-culture-identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity.htm?page=para016Master|title=QuickStats About Culture and Identity – Pacific Peoples|accessdate=12 June 2007|work=2006 Census|publisher=[[Statistics New Zealand]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829173025/http://www.stats.govt.nz/census/2006-census-data/quickstats-about-culture-identity/quickstats-about-culture-and-identity.htm?page=para016Master |archivedate=29 August 2007}}</ref>

==Geography==

{{Main|Geography of the Cook Islands}}The Cook Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean, northeast of New Zealand, between [[French Polynesia]] and [[American Samoa]]. There are 15&nbsp;major islands spread over {{convert|2200000|km²|0|abbr=on}} of ocean, divided into two distinct groups: the Southern Cook Islands and the Northern Cook Islands of [[Atoll|coral atolls]].<ref>"Cook Islands Travel Guide" (with description), ''World Travel Guide'', Nexus Media Communications, 2006. Webpage: [http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/65/country_guide/Australia-and-South-Pacific/Cook-Islands.html WTGuide-Cook-Islands].</ref>

The islands were formed by [[volcanic]] activity; the northern group is older and consists of six atolls, which are sunken volcanoes topped by [[coral]] growth. The climate is moderate to tropical.

[[File:Aitutaki-Motu Tapuaetai.jpg|thumb|[[Tapuaetai]] (One Foot Island) in the southern part of [[Aitutaki Atoll]]]]
The 15 islands and two reefs are grouped as follows:
* Southern Cook Islands:
** [[Nga-pu-Toru]] ("Three Roots", the eastern islands):
*** [[Atiu]] (Enua Manu or Island of Birds)
*** [[Ma'uke]] (Akatokamanava)
*** [[Mitiaro]] (Nukuroa)
*** [[Takutea]]
* Northern Cook Islands:
** [[Manihiki]] (Te Fuinga o Niva)
** [[Nassau (Cook Islands)|Nassau]] (Te Nuku o Ngalewu)
** [[Penrhyn Atoll]] (Tongareva or Mangarongaro)
** [[Pukapuka]] (Te Ulu o te Watu)
** [[Rakahanga]] (Tapuahua)
** [[Suwarrow]] also called Suvorov
** [[Tema Reef]] (submerged)
* Other islands:
** [[Aitutaki]] (Araura Enua)
** [[Mangaia]] (Auau Enua)
** [[Rarotonga]] (Tumutevarovaro), with the capital, Avarua.
** [[Palmerston Island]] (Pamati) sometimes grouped with the Northern Group.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Cook Islands}}

[[File:rarotonga beach.jpg|thumb|left|Beach on [[Rarotonga]]]]
The Cook Islands were first settled in the 6th century by [[Polynesian people]] who migrated from [[Tahiti]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120319005759/http://www.samoa2007.ws/index.php?id=224 Cook Islands] (archived from [http://www.samoa2007.ws/index.php?id=224 the original] on 19 March 2012).</ref> an island {{convert|1154|km}} to the northeast.

Spanish ships visited the islands in the 16th&nbsp;century; the first written record of contact with the islands came in 1595 with the sighting of [[Pukapuka]] by Spanish sailor [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], who called it ''San Bernardo'' (Saint Bernard). [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], a Portuguese captain working for the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish crown]], made the first recorded European landing in the islands when he set foot on [[Rakahanga]] in 1606, calling it ''Gente Hermosa'' (Beautiful People).<ref>{{cite book |first=Brian |last=Hooker |date=1998 |title=[[Terrae Incognitae (journal)|Terrae Incognitae]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |chapter-url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1179/tin.1998.30.1.54 |chapter=European discovery of the Cook Islands |pages=54-62}}</ref>

British navigator Captain [[James Cook]] arrived in 1773 and 1777<ref>Thomas, Nicholas (2003). ''Cook : the extraordinary voyages of Captain James Cook'', Walker & Company, ISBN 0802714129, pp. 310–311.</ref> and named the islands the ''Hervey Islands''; the name "Cook Islands", in honour of Cook, appeared on a Russian naval chart published in the 1820s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cook-islands.gov.ck/history.php|title=Cook Islands Government website|publisher=Cook-islands.gov.ck|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref>

In 1813 [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]], a missionary on the ''Endeavour'' (not the same ship as Cook's) made the first recorded sighting of [[Rarotonga]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chr.org.au/fpbooks/tendecades/TEN%20DECADES%20Chapter%203.doc|title=Ten Decades: The Australasian Centenary History of the London Missionary Society, Rev. Joseph King (Word document)|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> {{dubious|date=February 2013|John Williams}} The first recorded landing on Rarotonga by Europeans was in 1814 by the ''Cumberland''; trouble broke out between the sailors and the Islanders and many were killed on both sides.<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.ck/history.htm|title=History of the Cook Islands|publisher=Ck|accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> The islands saw no more Europeans until missionaries arrived from England in 1821. Christianity quickly took hold in the culture and many islanders continue to be Christian believers today.

[[File:Cook Islands Annexation Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Governor-General [[Lord Ranfurly]] reading the annexation proclamation to [[Makea Takau Ariki|Queen Makea]] on 7 October 1900.]]
The Cook Islands became a British [[protectorate]] in 1888, due largely to community fears that France might occupy the territory as it had Tahiti. On 6{{nbsp}}September 1900, the leading islanders presented a petition asking that the islands (including [[Niue]] "if possible") should be annexed as British territory.<ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891">''"Commonwealth and Colonial Law"'' by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 891</ref><ref>N.Z. Parliamentary Pp., A3 (1901)</ref> On 8–9 October 1900 seven instruments of cession of Rarotonga and other islands were signed by their chiefs and people; and by a British Proclamation issued at the same time the cessions were accepted, the islands being declared parts of Her Britanic Majesty's dominions.<ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966. P. 891"/> These instruments did not include [[Aitutaki]]. It appears that, though the inhabitants regarded themselves as British subjects, the Crown's title was uncertain, and the island was formally annexed by Proclamation dated 9{{nbsp}}October 1900.<ref>"Commonwealth and Colonial Law" by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 761</ref><ref>N.Z. Parliamentary Pp., A1 (1900)</ref> The islands were included within the boundaries of the [[Colony of New Zealand]] in 1901 by Order in Council<ref>S.R.O. & S.I. Rev.

P. 891"/>

When the British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 came into effect on 1{{nbsp}}January 1949, Cook Islanders who were [[British subject]]s gained [[New Zealand citizenship]].<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/citizenship/3 3. Aliens and citizens – Citizenship – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand]. Teara.govt.nz (4 March 2009). Retrieved 26 December 2012.</ref> The country remained a New Zealand dependent territory until&nbsp;1965, when the New Zealand Government decided to offer self-governing status to its colony. In that year, [[Albert Henry (politician)|Albert Henry]] of the [[Cook Islands Party]] was elected as the first Premier. Henry led the country until he was accused of vote-rigging. He was succeeded in 1978 by [[Tom Davis (Cook Islands)|Tom Davis]] of the [[Democratic Party (Cook Islands)|Democratic Party]].

==Politics and foreign relations==
{{Main|Politics of the Cook Islands|Foreign relations of the Cook Islands}}
[[File:Parliament of the Cook Islands - 2006.JPG|thumb|The parliament building of the Cook Islands, formerly a hotel.]]

The Cook Islands is a [[representative democracy]] with a [[parliamentary system]] in an [[associated state]] relationship with New Zealand. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, with the Chief Minister as [[head of government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of the Cook Islands]]. There is a pluriform multi-party system. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. The [[Head of State]] is the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Queen of New Zealand]], who is represented in the Cook Islands by the [[Monarchy in the Cook Islands|Queen's Representative]].

The islands are self-governing in "free association" with [[New Zealand]]. New Zealand retains primary responsibility for external affairs, with consultation with the Cook Islands government. Cook Islands nationals are citizens of New Zealand and can receive New Zealand government services, but the reverse is not true; New Zealand citizens are not Cook Islands nationals. Despite this, {{As of|2014|lc=y}}, the Cook Islands had diplomatic relations in its own name with 43 other countries. The Cook Islands is not a United Nations member state, but, along with [[Niue]], has had their "full treaty-making capacity" recognised by [[United Nations Secretariat]],<ref name=art102>{{citation |format=PDF |url=http://legal.un.org/repertory/art102/english/rep_supp8_vol6-art102_e_advance.pdf |title=Repertory of Practice |publisher=UN |contribution=Organs Supplement |number=8 |page=10}}</ref><ref name=map>{{citation |url=http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/world00.pdf |publisher=UN |title=The World today |format=PDF}}</ref> and is a full member of the [[WHO]] and [[UNESCO]] [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|UN specialised agencies]], is an associate member of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific ([[UNESCAP]]) and a Member of the Assembly of States of the [[International Criminal Court]].

On 11 June 1980, the United States signed [[Cook Islands – United States Maritime Boundary Treaty|a treaty]] with the Cook Islands specifying the [[maritime boundary|maritime border]] between the Cook Islands and [[American Samoa]] and also relinquishing any American claims to [[Penrhyn Island|Penrhyn]], [[Pukapuka]], [[Manihiki]], and [[Rakahanga]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1980/6.html|title=Treaty Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands on Friendship and Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary Between the United States of America and the Cook Islands (and Exchange of Notes)|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref> In 1990 the Cook Islands and France signed [[Maritime Delimitation Agreement (Cook Islands – France)|a treaty]] that [[boundary delimitation|delimited]] the boundary between the Cook Islands and [[French Polynesia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paclii.org/pits/en/treaty_database/1990/4.html|title=Agreement on Maritime Delimitation Between the Government of the Cook Islands and the Government of the French Republic|work=Pacific Islands Treaty Series|publisher=University of the South Pacific School of Law|accessdate=4 March 2010}}</ref> As competition between the US and China heated up in the [[South China Sea]] and other areas closer to the mainland, the Cook Islands began to feel the results. In late August 2012, for instance, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] visited the islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/trvl/2012/196973.htm|title=Secretary Clinton:Travel to the Cook Islands, Indonesia, China, Timor-Leste, Brunai, and Russia|accessdate=4 September 2012|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-south-pacific-20120829,0,4251912.story|title=Hillary Clinton's visit underscores new value of Cook Islands|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|last=Richter|first=Paul|date=29 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}</ref>

==Administrative subdivisions==
There are island councils on all of the inhabited outer islands (Outer Islands Local Government Act 1987 with amendments up to&nbsp;2004, and Palmerston Island Local Government Act 1993) except [[Nassau (Cook Islands)|Nassau]], which is governed by [[Pukapuka]] ([[Suwarrow]], with only one caretaker living on the island, also governed by Pukapuka, is not counted with the inhabited islands in this context). Each council is headed by a mayor.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of the Cook Islands}}
The economy is strongly affected by geography. It is isolated from foreign markets, and has some inadequate infrastructure; it lacks major natural resources, has limited manufacturing and suffers moderately from natural disasters.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Tourism provides the economic base which makes up approximately 67.5% of GDP.
Additionally, the economy is supported by foreign aid, largely from New Zealand. The Peoples' Republic of China has also contributed foreign aid which has resulted in, among other projects, the Police Headquarters building. The Cook Islands is expanding its agriculture, mining and fishing sectors, with varying success.

Since approximately 1989, the Cook Islands have become a location specialising in so-called [[asset-protection trusts#Cook Islands|asset protection trusts]], by which investors shelter assets from the reach of creditors and legal authorities.<ref name=flyspeck/><ref>{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Jurisdictions: Cook Islands|url=http://protectyou.com/1996/01/review-of-offshore-jurisdictions-part-1/|publisher=The Asset Protection News|last1=Rosen |first1=Howard |last2=Donlevy-Rosen |first2=Patricia}}</ref> According to ''The New York Times'', the Cooks have "laws devised to protect foreigners' assets from legal claims in their home countries" which were apparently crafted specifically to thwart the long arm of American justice; creditors must travel to the Cook Islands and argue their cases under Cooks law, often at prohibitive expense.<ref name=flyspeck/> Unlike other foreign jurisdictions such as the [[British Virgin Islands]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Switzerland]], the Cooks "generally disregard foreign court orders" and do not require that bank accounts, real estate, or other assets protected from scrutiny (it is illegal to disclose names or any information about Cooks trusts) be physically located within the archipelago.<ref name=flyspeck>Wayne, Leslie. [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/business/international/paradise-of-untouchable-assets.html Cook Islands, a Paradise of Untouchable Assets], ''The New York Times'', 14 December 2013.

====Carving====

[[Woodcarving]] is a common art form in the Cook Islands. The proximity of islands in the southern group helped produce a homogeneous style of carving but which had special developments in each island. Rarotonga is known for its fisherman's gods and staff-gods, [[Atiu]] for its wooden seats, [[Mitiaro]], [[Mauke]] and Atiu for mace and slab gods and [[Mangaia]] for its ceremonial adzes. Most of the original wood carvings were either spirited away by early European collectors or were burned in large numbers by missionaries. Today, carving is no longer the major art form with the same spiritual and cultural emphasis given to it by the Maori in New Zealand. However, there are continual efforts to interest young people in their heritage and some good work is being turned out under the guidance of older carvers. Atiu, in particular, has a strong tradition of crafts both in carving and local fibre arts such as tapa. Mangaia is the source of many fine adzes carved in a distinctive, idiosyncratic style with the so-called double-k design. Mangaia also produces food pounders carved from the heavy calcite found in its extensive limestone caves.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lords of the Dance – Culture of the Cook Islands: Visual Arts|url=http://www.ck/culture.htm#visual|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref>

====Weaving====
The outer islands produce traditional [[weaving]] of mats, basketware and hats. Particularly fine examples of rito hats are worn by women to church. They are made from the uncurled immature fibre of the coconut palm and are of very high quality. The Polynesian equivalent of Panama hats, they are highly valued and are keenly sought by Polynesian visitors from Tahiti. Often, they are decorated with hatbands made of minuscule pupu shells which are painted and stitched on by hand. Although pupu are found on other islands the collection and use of them in decorative work has become a speciality of Mangaia. The weaving of rito is a speciality of the northern island of Penrhyn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lords of the Dance – Culture of the Cook Islands: Crafts|url=http://www.ck/culture.htm#crafts|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref>

====Tivaevae====
A major art form in the Cook Islands is [[tivaevae]]. This is, in essence, the art of handmade Island scenery patchwork quilts. Introduced by the wives of missionaries in the 19th century, the craft grew into a communal activity and is probably one of the main reasons for its popularity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tivaevae – Quilts of the Cook Islands|url=http://www.ck/tivaevae.htm|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref>

====Contemporary art====
The Cook Islands has produced internationally recognised contemporary artists, especially in the main island of Rarotonga. Artists include painter (and photographer) Mahiriki Tangaroa, sculptors Eruera (Ted) Nia (originally a film maker) and master carver Mike Tavioni, painter (and Polynesian tattoo enthusiast) Upoko'ina Ian George, Aitutakian-born painter Tim Manavaroa Buchanan, Loretta Reynolds, Judith Kunzlé, Joan Rolls Gragg, Kay George (who is also known for her fabric designs), Apii Rongo, Varu Samuel, and multi-media, installation and community-project artist [[Ani O'Neill]], all of whom currently live on the main island of Rarotonga. Atiuan-based Andrea Eimke is an artist who works in the medium of tapa and other textiles, and also co-authored the book 'Tivaivai – The Social Fabric of the Cook Islands' with British academic Susanne Kuechler. Many of these artists have studied at university art schools in New Zealand and continue to enjoy close links with the New Zealand art scene.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Cook Islands Arts Community|url=http://cookislandsarts.com|publisher=cookislandsarts.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref>

New Zealand-based Cook Islander artists include [[Michel Tuffery]], print-maker David Teata, Richard Shortland Cooper, Sylvia Marsters and [[Jim Vivieaere]].

On Rarotonga, the main commercial galleries are Beachcomber Contemporary Art (Taputapuatea, Avarua) run by Ben & Trevon Bergman,<ref>{{cite web|title=BCA Gallery, Rarotonga|url=http://www.gallerybca.com|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref> and The Art Studio Gallery (Arorangi) run by Ian and Kay George.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ian George - Tutai - Guiding Pacific Arts|url=http://www.tautai.org/artist/ian-george/|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref> The Cook Islands National Museum also exhibits art.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cook Islands Museum and Library Society|url=http://cook-islands-library-museum.org/|access-date=2016-04-08}}</ref>

* In April 2007, 27 [[Kuhl's lorikeet]] were re-introduced to [[Atiu]] from [[Rimatara]]. Fossil and oral traditions indicate that the species was formerly on at least five islands of the southern group.
