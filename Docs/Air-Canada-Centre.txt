<!-- This article uses Canadian English. "Centre" is the correct spelling in this case. -->
The '''Air Canada Centre<!-- Please do not change the spelling to "Center" as "Centre" is the correct spelling in Canada --> (ACC)''' is a multi-purpose indoor sporting [[arena]] located on [[Bay Street]] in the [[South Core, Toronto|South Core]] district of [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]] [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It is the home of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), the [[Toronto Raptors]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) and the [[Toronto Rock]] of the [[National Lacrosse League]] (NLL).  In addition, the [[Toronto Marlies]] of the [[American Hockey League]] play occasional games at the arena,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marlies.ca/news/News.asp?story_id=221|title=Bulldogs Bite Marlies At Air Canada Centre|date=2005-11-03|accessdate=2015-06-30|first=John|last=Bartlett|publisher=[[Toronto Marlies]]}}</ref> and the [[Raptors 905]] of the [[NBA Development League]] plan to play occasional games at the venue as well.  The area was previously home to the [[Toronto Phantoms]] of the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL) during their brief existence. The arena is popularly known as ''the ACC'' or ''the Hangar'' (the latter nickname came from its [[Naming rights|sponsorship]] by [[Air Canada]]).

The arena is owned and operated by [[Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment|Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd.]] (MLSE), the same group that owns both the Leafs and Raptors, as well as their respective development teams, and is {{convert|665,000|ft2|m2|abbr=off}} in size. In 2008, the ACC was the fifth busiest arena in the world and the busiest in Canada.<ref>[http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/mts_centre_19th-busiest_showbiz_venue_in_world38266214.html MTS Centre 19th-busiest showbiz venue in world]. Winnipeg Free Press (January 24, 2009). Retrieved on July 26, 2013.</ref> The Air Canada Centre is connected to [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] and the underground pedestrian [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH system]], providing access to public transportation ([[Toronto Transit Commission|TTC's]] [[Union (TTC)|Union subway station]] and [[GO Transit]]). There are also 13,000 parking spaces.

The Air Canada Centre has, from its initial design to completion, revolutionized many concepts included in new arenas and stadiums built since then. These features include luxury suites accessible on the ground floor, splitting the main scoreboard into several sections, rotating all sponsor signage in the bowl at once (to allow dominant messaging), and multiple restaurants in and out of the main arena bowl view.

==History==
[[File:Placaacc4.JPG|left|thumb|300px|Chronology sign.]]
[[File:Air Canada Center interior.jpg|right|thumb|A Raptors game vs the Sacramento Kings with the previous logo and colours, as well as the old scoreboard, later relocated to [[Ricoh Coliseum]]]]

Construction of the Air Canada Centre was started by the Toronto Raptors under its initial ownership group headed by Canadian businessman [[John Bitove]] who played in the SkyDome. Groundbreaking took place in March 1997. While construction was in progress, the Raptors and their partially completed arena were purchased by MLSE, which was contemplating building their own arena for the Maple Leafs to replace the ageing [[Maple Leaf Gardens]]. MLSE subsequently ordered major modifications to the original design, which was basketball-specific, to make the arena become more suitable for hockey. Originally planned to cost $217 million, MLSE increased the budget to $265 million after taking control.<ref name=cost>{{cite news|title=Upgrades added to cost|first=David|last=Shoalts|date=February 17, 1999|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>  The Raptors were twice fined a million dollars (which were donated to their charitable foundation) by the NBA for missing deadlines to begin construction of their new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Raptors' arena bites dust|last=Christe|first=James|date=May 16, 1997|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>

The arena site was once occupied by [[Canada Post]]'s Toronto Postal Delivery Building (designed by [[Charles B. Dolphin]]), which was briefly handed over to Department of National Defence for war storage purposes upon completion in 1941, but returned to Canada Post in 1946. In the early 1990s, real estate developers [[Bramalea (company)|Bramalea Ltd]] and [[Trizec Properties|Trizec]] arranged to purchase the building from Canada Post with equal ownership, and redevelop the site into a {{convert|2500000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} office, retail and residential space. The financial and development details of the purchase had various conditions around the property being rezoned by the city, and remediation of soil contamination by Canada Post before any development.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bramalea's Moves Shake Taxpayers|first=Stevie|last=Cameron|date=November 15, 1992|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}</ref>  Due to financial difficulties, the building ownership was returned to Canada Post in 1993. The Toronto Raptors purchased the building from Canada Post the next year.

The current building retains the striking [[Art Deco]] façades of the east (along [[Bay Street]]) and south ([[Lake Shore Boulevard]]) walls of that structure, but the rest of the building (facing [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]]) was removed to make room for the arena, through the process of [[facadism]]. The original building is protected under the [[Ontario Heritage Act]].

A 15-storey tower on Bay Street stands at {{convert|55|m|ft}} and provides connections in the atrium to Union Station, Bay Street, and York Street (via Bremner Boulevard). The Air Canada Centre is connected to the [[PATH (Toronto)|underground PATH network]].

[[Air Canada]] purchased naming rights to the arena for $30 million over 20 years since opening.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/marketing/|work=CBC News|title=Branding for dollars|date=February 15, 2007}}</ref>

===Developments since opening===
[[File:AirCanadaCentre2.jpg|thumb|Gate 5 entrance off [[Maple Leaf Square]]]]

In 2003, MLSE completed a $5 million upgrade of the arena, including a new LED signage system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=459588|title=Air Canada Centre Renovations to Improve Ultimate Fan Experience|date=September 9, 2003|accessdate=January 6, 2014|publisher=[[Toronto Maple Leafs]]}}</ref>  During the summer of 2015, a $10 million upgrade of the arena was carried out, which included the installation of a new scoreboard four times as large as the previous one.  The old scoreboard was later installed at [[Ricoh Coliseum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/leafs/2015/07/24/acc-to-debut-new-scoreboard-this-year.html|title=Air Canada Centre to debut new scoreboard this year|first=Raju|last=Mudhar|date=2015-07-24|accessdate=2015-07-24|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>

====Maple Leaf Square====
{{main|Maple Leaf Square}}

In late 2005, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment announced that they would be renovating the western side of the Air Canada Centre during the 2008 off-season to connect it with the [[Maple Leaf Square]] development. Maple Leaf Square is jointly owned by MLSE, Cadillac Fairview and Lantera Developments. The $500 million development includes two restaurants, Hotel Le Germain at Maple Leaf Square boutique hotel, extensive retail shopping, including a {{convert|9000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Leafs, [[Toronto Marlies|Marlies]], Raptors, and [[Toronto FC]] store, two 54-storey condominiums, a [[Longo's]] supermarket, and a public square. It opened in 2010. The two-year, $48 million renovation of the ACC added a new atrium that includes a High-Definition broadcast studio for [[Leafs TV]], [[NBA TV Canada]] and [[GolTV (Canada)|GolTV Canada]]. The outside wall of the atrium features a {{convert|30|by|50|ft|m|sing=on}} video screen overlooking the plaza, which often broadcasts games taking place inside the arena. During [[Stanley Cup playoffs|NHL]] and [[NBA playoffs|NBA playoff]] runs, the square attracts thousands of Leafs and Raptors fans, respectively, sometimes broadcasting away playoff matches featuring the Leafs and/or the Raptors as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/raptors/news/accexpansion_presser_091109.html|title=Air Canada Centre Re-Opens Bigger And Better After Summer Hiatus|date=September 11, 2009|accessdate=January 6, 2014|publisher=[[Toronto Raptors]]}}</ref> A section of the square is designated Ford Fan Zone at Maple Leaf Square, with naming rights given to the [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]].

The first Maple Leafs home game took place on February 20, 1999, versus the [[Montreal Canadiens]], won by the Leafs 3–2 on an [[overtime (ice hockey)|overtime]] goal by [[Steve Thomas (ice hockey)|Steve Thomas]]. Maple Leaf home games are generally sold out,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Cheryl|title=Toronto Maple Leafs|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/toronto-maple-leafs/#h3_jump_10|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref> and despite their lack of appearances in NHL playoffs and the Stanley Cup, there is a waitlist since the start of 2015 for Season Ticket Holders for upcoming seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Purchase Season Seats|url=http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=73129|website=Toronto Maple Leafs|accessdate=9 March 2015}}</ref> The first Raptors game took place the following night versus the [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] (later moved to [[Memphis Grizzlies|Memphis]]). The Raptors won 102–87 in front of a sell-out crowd. The facility hosted the [[50th National Hockey League All-Star Game|2000 NHL All-Star Game]], the championship game of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]] and hosted the [[2016 NBA All-Star Game]].

The Toronto Rock also moved to the ACC from Maple Leaf Gardens for the [[2001 NLL season]]. The Rock's first game was a 17–7 win over the [[Ottawa Rebel]] on December 21, 2000.

On October 3, 2003, the ACC had a power outage during the third quarter of a [[Toronto Raptors|Raptors]] pre-season game against the Greek club [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]]. The game was called final, because the power was not restored in time and Toronto already had a [[Mercy rule|30-point lead]].

Between 2011 and 2013, it has played host to three [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) events.
