{{Politics of Mexico}}

The [[Mexico|United Mexican States]] ({{lang-es|Estados Unidos Mexicanos}}) is a [[Federation|federal republic]] composed of 32 federal entities: 31 [[states of Mexico|states]] and one "[[federal district]]" ([[Mexico City]]).

According to the [[Political Constitution of the United Mexican States|Constitution of 1917]], the states of the federation are free and sovereign.<ref>{{cite web |title=Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States|url=http://www.scjn.gob.mx/SiteCollectionDocuments/PortalSCJN/RecJur/BibliotecaDigitalSCJN/PublicacionesSupremaCorte/Political_constitucion_of_the_united_Mexican_states_2008.pdf |publisher=Supreme Court of Mexico |page=113 |accessdate= April 5, 2011}}</ref> Each state has its own congress and constitution, while the [[Mexico City|Federal District]] has only limited autonomy with a [[Legislative Assembly of the Federal District|local Congress]] and government. The territory of the Federal District, commonly known and referred to as Mexico City, serves as the national capital.

===States===
{{Main|States of Mexico}}

===Roles and powers of the states===
[[File:Localisation de l'ile de Clipperton.png|thumbnail|Location of [[Socorro Island]] and the rest of the [[Revillagigedo Archipelago]], and extent of Mexico's western [[EEZ]] in the Pacific]]
The states of the Mexican Federation are free, sovereign, autonomous and independent of each other. They are free to govern themselves according to their own laws; each state has a constitution that cannot contradict the federal constitution, which covers issues of national competence. The states cannot make alliances with other states or any independent nation without the consent of the whole federation, except those of defense and security arrangements necessary to keep the border states secure in the event of an invasion. The political organization of each state is based on a separation of powers in a congressional system: [[legislative power]] is vested in a unicameral congress (the federal congress has two chambers); [[executive power]] is independent of the legislature and vested in a governor elected by [[universal suffrage]]; and [[judicial power]] is vested in a [[Court|Superior Court of Justice]]. Since states have legal autonomy, each has its own civil and penal codes and judicial body.

In the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]], the federative entities – the States and the Federal District – are each represented by 3 senators, 2 elected by universal suffrage on the principle of relative majority and 1 assigned to the party which obtains the largest minority. In addition, the federation makes up a constituency in which 32 senators are elected by the method of [[proportional representation]]. Federal Deputies, however, do not represent the states, but rather the citizens themselves. The [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Chamber of Deputies]] and the [[Senate (Mexico)|Senate]] together comprise the [[Congress of Mexico|Congress of the Union]].

===Internal organization of states===
{{Main|Municipalities of Mexico|Settlement classification in Mexico}}
The states are internally divided into municipalities. Each municipality is autonomous in its ability to elect their own council. The council is headed by a mayor elected every 3 years with no possibility of immediate reelection. Each municipality has a council composed of councilors in terms of population size. The council is responsible, in most cases, to provide all utilities required for its population. This concept, which arises from the [[Mexican Revolution]], is known as a "free municipality". In total there are 2438 municipalities in Mexico, the state with the highest number of municipalities is [[Oaxaca]], with 570, and the state with the lowest number is [[Baja California]], with only 5.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://portal.veracruz.gob.mx/portal/page?_pageid=433,4078171&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL|title= Catalogo de Municipos y Localidades por Estado}}</ref>

===Federal district===
[[Mexico City]] has a special status within the federation. According to Article 44 of the federal constitution, Mexico City is the Federal District, seat of government of the Union and the capital of the United Mexican States. The city is coextensive with the Federal District territorially and administratively. If the federal government moves to another city, the Federal District would be transformed into another state of the Union, called "State of the Valley of Mexico" with new borders and area that the Congress of the Union would give it.

Mexico City was separated from the [[State of Mexico]], of which it was the capital, on November 18, 1824, to become the capital of the federation. As such, it does not belong to any state in particular but to all (i.e., to the federation). Therefore, it was the [[president of Mexico]], in representation of the federation, who designated its [[Head of Government of the Federal District|head of government]] (previously called ''regente'', "regent" or ''jefe del departamento del Distrito Federal'', "head of the department of the Federal District"). However, the Federal District received full autonomy in 1997 and its citizens now elect directly their chief of government, the head of the boroughs (or ''delegaciones'') and the representatives of the unicameral legislature called the ''Asamblea Legislativa'', "Legislative Assembly". It does not have a constitution but a statute of autonomy. Nonetheless it enjoys many privileges as the capital of the federation.

====Internal divisions of the federal district====
{{Main|Boroughs of the Mexican Federal District}}

For administrative purposes, the Federal District is divided into 16 ''delegaciones'' or [[boroughs of the Mexican Federal District|boroughs]]. While not fully equivalent to a municipality or to the concept of a ''municipio libre'', the 16 boroughs have gained significant autonomy, and since 2000, the heads of government of the boroughs are elected directly by plurality (they were previously appointed by the head of government of the Federal District).

Since Mexico City is organized entirely as a Federal District, most of the city services are provided by the Government of the Federal District, not by the boroughs themselves. In the constituent states, services would be provided by the municipalities. It should be noted that while other municipalities within the constituent states of the federation exercise their autonomy through the municipal council, some municipalities, like [[Mexicali Municipality|Mexicali]] and [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]], have further subdivided the municipality into ''delegaciones'' (boroughs) for administrative purposes.

==Self-determination of the indigenous peoples==
The second article of the constitution recognizes the multicultural composition of the nation founded upon the [[indigenous peoples of Mexico|indigenous peoples]] to whom the government grants the right of self-(free) determination and autonomy. According to this article the indigenous peoples are granted
* The right to decide the internal forms of social, economic, political and cultural organization;
* The right to apply their own normative systems of regulation as long as human rights and rights of women (gender equality) are granted;
* The right to preserve and enrich their languages and culture;
* The right to elect representatives before the municipal council in which their territories are located; amongst other rights.

The nation commits to and demands the constituent states and municipalities to promote the economic and social development of the indigenous communities as well as an intercultural and bilingual education. According to the Law of Linguistic Rights, the nation recognizes 62 indigenous languages as "[[languages of Mexico|national languages]]" with the same validity as Spanish in the territories in which they are spoken and the indigenous peoples are entitled to request public services in their languages.

==History==

===Constitutional empire===
[[File:Political divisions of Mexico 1821 (location map scheme).svg|thumb|300px|Political divisions of the [[First Mexican Empire]].{{legend|#666666|Treaty of Córdoba}}
{{legend|#4D4D4D|Acquisitions (1821–1822)}}]]
On September 27, 1821, after three centuries of Spanish rule, [[Mexico]] gained independence. The [[Treaty of Córdoba]] recognized part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] as an Independent Empire – "monarchist, constitutional and moderate".<ref>{{cite web |title=24 de agosto de 1821. Se firman los tratados de Córdoba|url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1055:24-de-agosto-de-1821-se-firman-los-tratados-de-cordoba&catid=120:agosto&Itemid=221 |publisher=Gobierno Federal |accessdate= October 5, 2010}}</ref> The new country took the name of [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]]. The morning after the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] entered [[Mexico City]] on September 28, 1821, [[Agustín de Iturbide]] ordered the Supreme Provisional Governmental Junta (September 1821 – February 1822) to meet to elect a president of the Imperial Regency and to issue a declaration of independence for the new nation. Iturbide was elected president of the Regency, and that afternoon the members of the Regency and the Supreme Junta signed the Declaration.

A minority of the Constituent Congress, looking for stability, elected [[Agustín de Iturbide]] as emperor. On July 21, 1822, Iturbide was crowned Emperor of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |title= 21 de julio de 1822. Agustín de Iturbide es coronado emperador de México. |publisher= Gobierno Federal |url = http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1034:21-de-julio-de-1822-agustin-de-iturbide-es-coronado-emperador-de-mexico&catid=119:julio&Itemid=220 |accessdate= October 5, 2010}}</ref> However, the ''Constitutional Empire'' quickly demonstrated the incompatibility of its two main parts: the Emperor and the Constituent Congress. The deputies were imprisoned just for expressing their opinions and finally, Iturbide decided to dissolve the Congress and establish instead a National Board.<ref>{{cite web |title=La Transición del Imperio a la Republica (1821–1823) |url=http://www.iih.unam.mx/moderna/ehmc/ehmc11/136.html#nf41|publisher=Estudios de Historia Moderna y Contemporánea de México|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>

The lack of a legitimate legislature, the illegitimacy of the Emperor and the absence of real solutions to the nation's problems increased revolutionary activity.<ref>{{cite book |last=Suárez y Navarro |first=Juan  |title=Historia de México y del general Antonio López de Santa Anna |year=1850 |location=México |page=23}}</ref> [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] proclaimed the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], to which later joined [[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Nicolás Bravo]]. Iturbide was forced to reestablish the Congress and in a vain attempt to save the order and keep the situation favorable to his supporters, he abdicated the crown of the Empire on March 19, 1823.<ref name=iih>{{cite news | title=La Transicion del Imperio a la Republica o la Participacion Indiscriminada | url=http://www.iih.unam.mx/moderna/ehmc/ehmc11/136.html| language =Spanish}}
</ref>

However, the Congress nullified the designation of Iturbide and therefore the recognition of the abdication and made the coronation of Iturbide seem a logical mistake in consummation of Independence.<ref name=iih/>

The dissolution of the Empire was the first political realignment of independent Mexico.

===Federal republic===

{{legend|#4D4D4D|Federal territory}}
{{legend|#666666|Sovereign state}}]]
After the fall of the Empire a [[triumvirate]] called the [[Supreme Executive Power]] was created. The provisional government would be responsible for the creation of the [[Federal Republic]], and it was in effect from April 1, 1823 to October 10, 1824.<ref>{{cite web |title=El Viajero en México (Pág. 30)|url=http://cdigital.dgb.uanl.mx/la/1020004349/1020004349_004.pdf|publisher=CDigital|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>

Unrest in the provinces was huge. On May 21, 1823, '''The Founding Plan of the Federal Republic''' was enacted. Its sixth article precisely stated, "The component parts of the Republic are free, sovereign and independent States in that which touches internal administration and government".<ref>{{cite web |title=División Territorial de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos (1810–1995) Pag.21|url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/divi_terri/1810-1985/eum/ESTADOS%20UNIDOS%20MEXICANOS.pdf|publisher=INEGI|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref> Most of the ''Free States'' which were invited to form the [[Federal Republic]] joined the Union, except for the former [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] which formed their own Federal Republic.<ref>{{cite web |title=01 de julio de 1823. Las Provincias Unidas del Centro de América se independizan de México |url=http://www.bicentenario.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1017:01-de-julio-de-1823-las-provincias-unidas-del-centro-de-america-se-independizan-de-mexico&catid=119:julio&Itemid=220|publisher=Gobierno Federal|accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>

On January 31, 1824, the decree to create a '''Constitutive Act of the Mexican Federation''' was issued, which incorporated the basic structure of the Federal Republic. It was determined that the criteria for inviting states to the federation should be that they "...not be so few that through expansion and wealth in a few years they be able to aspire to constitute themselves as independent nations, breaking the federal bond, nor so many that through lack of manpower and resources the system should come to be unworkable."<ref>{{cite news | title=Acta constitucional presentada al soberano Congreso Constituyente por su comisión. | url=http://www.biblioteca.tv/artman2/publish/1823_122/Acta_constitucional_presentada_al_soberano_Congres_183.shtml| language =Spanish}}</ref>

Between 1823 and 1824, some of the ''free states'' created their own constitutions and others had already installed a Constituent Congress. Special cases were those of [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], which on December 23, 1823 decided to join the federation but as a Federated Republic, and [[Chiapas]], which decided by referendum to join the federation on September 14, 1824.<ref>{{cite news | title=Aniversario de la Federación de Chiapas a México | url=http://www.blogsentrelagente.com.mx/blog_home.asp?idU=230&idP=5871| language =Spanish}}</ref>

On October 4, 1824, the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1824]] was enacted. The constitution officially created the [[United Mexican States]]. The country was composed of 19 states and 4 federal territories.<ref>{{cite news | title=Decreto.

On October 10, 1824, [[Guadalupe Victoria]] took office as the first [[President of Mexico]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Guadalupe Victoria.| url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/264-guadalupe-victoria-presidente-desconocido}}</ref>

===Centralist republic===

{{legend|#AA0000|Territory claimed by the Republic of the Rio Grande}}
{{legend|#552200|Rebellions}}]]
The political structure of the [[Republic]] was amended by a decree on October 3, 1835, when the [[Centralized government|centralist system]] was established.

The constituent states of the [[Republic]] lost their freedom, autonomy, independence, and sovereignty by being totally subordinated to the central government. However, the territorial division itself was the same; the text of Article 8 of the Law determined: The national territory is divided into [[Department (administrative division)|departments]], on the basis of population, location and other leading circumstances: its number, extension and subdivisions, would be detailed by constitutional law.<ref>"Bases Constitucionales Expedidas por el Congreso Constituyente", en Felipe Tena Ramírez", ''Op.cit.'' p. 203</ref>

The [[Siete Leyes|Seven Constitutional Laws]] ({{lang-es|Siete Leyes Constitucionales}}) were promulgated on December 30, 1836.<ref>{{cite news | title=La Suprema Corte en las Constituciones Centralistas.| url=http://www.bibliojuridica.org/libros/2/721/37.pdf| language =Spanish}}</ref> The 1st article confirmed the decree of the law October 3, 1835; the [[Republic]] would be divided into departments, these in districts and the districts in parties. The 2nd article pointed that the division of the [[Republic]] in departments would be under a special law with constitutional character.<ref>{{cite news | title=Division Territorial de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos de 1810 a 1995 (Page 27).| url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/divi_terri/1810-1985/eum/ESTADOS%20UNIDOS%20MEXICANOS.pdf| language =Spanish}}</ref> On December 30, 1835, a transitory decree was added to the [[Siete Leyes|Seven Laws]]. The decree stated that the territory of Tlaxcala and the Federal District would become a part of the Department of Mexico. The territories of Alta and Baja California would form the department of the Californias. Coahuila y Texas would be divided into two departments. Colima would form part of Michoacán and Aguascalientes would be declared a department.

This period of political instability caused several conflicts between the central government and the entities of the country. There were rebellions in several states such as:<ref>{{cite news | title=Division Territorial de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos de 1810 a 1995 (Page 28)| url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/divi_terri/1810-1985/eum/ESTADOS%20UNIDOS%20MEXICANOS.pdf| language =Spanish}}</ref>
* [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] due its condition of ''Federated Republic'' declared itself independent in 1840 (officially in 1841). The [[Republic of Yucatán|República de Yucatán]] ({{lang-en|Republic of Yucatán}}) rejoined Mexico in 1848.
* [[Texas]] declared its independence and declared war against the central government of [[Mexico]]. The [[Republic of Texas]] was created.  Texas remained independent until 1845, when it joined the United States of America.  From 1861–1865, Texas was part of the [[Confederate States of America]].  After the defeat of the Confederacy in the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65) and [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], Texas rejoined the United States of America in 1870.
* The states of [[Nuevo León]], [[Tamaulipas]] and [[Coahuila]] declared themselves independent from Mexico for just under 250 days; the [[República del Río Grande]] never consolidated because independent forces were defeated by the centralist forces.
* [[Tabasco (state)|Tabasco]] declared its separation from Mexico in February 1841, in protest against centralism and the imposed sanctions by centralist president [[Anastasio Bustamante]]. It rejoined in December 1842.
On September 11, 1842, the region of [[Soconusco]] joined [[Mexico]] as part of the department of [[Chiapas]].

===Restoration of the Republic and Second Empire===
The Federal Republic was restored by the interim president [[José Mariano Salas]] on August 22, 1846. The state of [[Guerrero]] was erected in 1849 (provisionally), conditioned to the acceptance of the legislatures of the states of [[State of México|México]], [[Puebla]] and [[Michoacán]]; which would be affected in their territories.

On February 5, 1857, was enacted the [[1857 Constitution of Mexico|Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857]]. On 1864, however, after the [[French intervention in Mexico|French intervention]], the conservative Mexicans restored the constitutional monarchy, known as the [[Second Mexican Empire]], led by the emperor [[Maximilian of Habsburg]] and supported by the French army of [[Napoleon III]]. The Empire was deposed in 1867 by the republican forces of [[Benito Juarez]] and the Federal Republic was restored again under the Constitution of 1857.

The [[Political Constitution of the United Mexican States]] of 1917 was the result of the [[Mexican Revolution]]. The third Constitution of Mexico confirmed the federal system of government that is currently in force.<ref>{{cite news | title=Division Territorial de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos de 1810 a 1995 (Page 29)| url=http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/integracion/pais/divi_terri/1810-1985/eum/ESTADOS%20UNIDOS%20MEXICANOS.pdf| language =Spanish}}</ref>

==Notes==
* {{note|De Facto Flags|a}}Some of these flags are used in states like Civil or Historic Flags (Yucatán, Hidalgo, Baja California, Michoacán) and are even more recognized by people as the official state flags assigned by President Ernesto Zedillo in 1999 and can be found waving in homes of the people. The others are proposed by citizen or groups to state legislatures, but have not yet been approved. Only two states in Mexico have changed the flags and have formalized their own, Jalisco and Tlaxcala.
