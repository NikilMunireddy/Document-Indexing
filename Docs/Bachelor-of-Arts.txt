A '''Bachelor of Arts''' ('''BA''', '''B.A.''', '''AB''' or '''A.B.''' from the [[Latin]] ''artium baccalaureus'' or ''baccalaureus artium'') is a [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] course or program in either the [[liberal arts]], the sciences, or both. Bachelor of Arts degree programs generally take three to four years depending on the country, academic institution, and specific specializations, majors or minors. The word ''baccalaureus'' or ''baccalarium'' (from the Latin ''bacca'', a berry, and ''laureus'', "of the [[bay laurel]]") should not be confused with ''baccalaureatus'' (translatable as "gold-plated scepter" by using the Latin ''baculum'' and ''aureatus''), which refers to the one- to two-year postgraduate ''Bachelor of Arts [[Honours degree|with Honours]]'' degree (''Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore'') in some countries.

[[Diploma]]s generally give the name of the institution, signatures of officials of the institution (generally the president or rector of the [[university]] as well as the secretary or dean of the component [[college]]), the type of degree conferred, the conferring authority and the location at which the degree is conferred. Degree diplomas generally are printed on high quality [[paper]] or [[parchment]]; individual institutions set the preferred abbreviation for their degrees.<ref>[http://www.harvard.edu/degree-abbreviations An Explanation of Degree Abbreviations - Harvard University Commencement]</ref>

The Bachelor of Arts degree is usually attained in four years in [[Afghanistan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]], [[Greece]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Nigeria]], [[Serbia]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[South Korea]], [[Iraq]], [[Tunisia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Turkey]], the United States of America and most of the [[Americas]].<ref>[http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US5/REF/gpa.html FAST-US-5 United States Education Reference File<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

They generally last three years in nearly all of the [[European Union]], and in [[Albania]], [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[the Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec]].

==Australia, Canada, Nepal, New Zealand, South Africa==
In colleges and universities in Australia, New Zealand, [[Nepal]] and South Africa, the BA degree can be taken over three years of full-time study.<ref>[http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144 Bachelor of Arts degrees], [[Australian National University]]</ref> Students must pursue at least one [[academic major|major]] area of study, and units from that subject are usually studied in each year, though sometimes students may choose to complete upper level classes in the same year and thus can leave space for elective subjects from a different field. At some universities students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects make up the degree.

Unlike in other countries, students do not receive an overall grade for their Bachelor of Arts degree with varying levels of honours ("honours" is a distinction but not part of the degree itself). Qualified students may be admitted, after they have achieved their (general) Bachelor's program with a high overall grade point average, to a further one year Bachelor (with) Honours degree program (''(with) Honours'' is part of the degree itself). Thus, to achieve a Bachelor (with) Honours degree (abbr. e.g. BA (Hons.) or BA hons.), an extra "[[postgraduate]]" year and a high research honour's thesis must be completed; see [[Honours Degree]]s. A student who holds a (with) Honours degree is eligible for direct entry to either a Doctorate (Ph.D.) or a very high research Master´s degree program.

Education in [[Canada]] is controlled by the Provinces, and can be very different depending on the region in Canada.  Canadian colleges and universities typically offer a 4, and to a much lesser extent 3 year Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). In many universities and colleges Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as Bachelors of Arts or as honours Bachelor of Arts degree. The term "Honours" is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs.

The honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of '(Hon(s))'. It should not be confused with the consecutive [[honours degree|Bachelor of Arts degree "with Honours"]], Latin "Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore", abbr. 'BA hon.' ''de jure'' without brackets and with a dot. It is a "postgraduate" degree, which is considered to be the equivalent of a corresponding maîtrise degree under the French influenced system. Going back in history, a three-year Bachelor of Arts degree (also known e.g. in Québec as grade de bachelier ès arts) was also called a ''pass degree'' or ''general degree''.

A student who first achieves a general Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall average may be admitted to a "postgraduate" Baccalaureatus cum Honore degree in the same field; it requires a minimum of one years but may also take longer; it typically does not exceed two years. Students are required to undertake a long high quality research empirical thesis (Honours Seminar Thesis) combined with a selection of courses from the relevant field of studies. The consecutive B. cum Honore degree is essential if students ultimate goal is to study towards a two- or three-year very high research masters´ degree qualification. A student holding a Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree also may choose to complete a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program without the requirement to first complete a master's degree. Over the years, in some universities certain Baccalaureatus cum Honore programs have been changed to corresponding master´s degrees.

In general, in all four countries the B.A. degree is the standard required for entry into  a [[Master of Arts|master's]] programme. In science, a BA hons degree is generally a prerequisite for entrance to a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] programme or a very-high-research-activity master´s programme. As such, for example the UK awarded ''honours'' are designed and should not be confused with Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and South African awarded BA hons/BA (Hons) degree.

For further clarification, in other countries the so-called ''honours'' bachelor may not be an actual degree, but the name of a (vocational) programme which can be completed through specified course work, a high grade average, and the completion of possibly a short paper or project; students who completed such a ''honours'' BA programm sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' after the degree abbreviation without a space, in parentheses and after the 'Hon(s)' without a dot, for example 'B.A.(Hon)'. The 3 and 4 year B.A. degree is also accepted for entry into graduate professional programmes such as [[LLB#Structure of LL.B. programmes|law]] or an [[M.B.A.]] program.

==Netherlands / Europe==
In the [[Netherlands]], the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees were introduced in 2002. Until then there was a single program which led to the [[doctorandus]] degree. This comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs combined. (The title ''doctorandus'' was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (''meester'') and engineering (''[[ingenieur]]'').) Those who had already started the doctorandus program could, on completing it, opt for the doctorandus degree (entitling them to use "Drs." in front of their name), or could use the master's degree (post-nominal letters) in accordance with the new standard.
A similar practice has been introduced in other EU countries, according to the [[Bologna Process]].

==Germany==
In Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a ''Universität'' (plural: ''Universitäten'') or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (plural: ''Fachhochschulen''); both can be referred to as a ''Hochschule'', which is the generic term in Germany for all institutions awarding academic degrees. Fachhochschule is often translated as "University of Applied Sciences". Universitäten place greater emphasis on fundamental science and theoretical background, while Fachhochschulen are generally designed with a focus on teaching professional skills. Degrees earned at Universitäten and Fachhochschulen are legally equivalent.

In Germany, the B.A. normally lasts between 3 and 3 ½ years – 6 or 7 semesters – and is awarded after the student earns between 180 and 210 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
{{Main|British undergraduate degree classification}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] (excluding [[Scotland]]) and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the first degree course normally lasts three years, but nomenclature varies: 19th-century and later universities usually distinguish between arts and sciences subjects by awarding either a B.A. or B.Sc. degree. However, some older or [[ancient universities]], such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] traditionally award B.A.s to undergraduates having completed the final examinations, e.g. Part II [[Tripos]] (Cambridge), Final Honour Schools (Oxford), Moderatorship (Dublin), in most subjects including the sciences. Some new [[plate glass university|plate glass universities]] established in the 1960s, such as [[University of York|York]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] originally followed the practice of Oxford and Cambridge by awarding B.A.s in all subjects, but have since changed to awarding B.Sc. degrees in science subjects. At Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] can be claimed, usually 21 terms after [[matriculation]]. For many centuries, the bachelor's degree was an intermediate step and was awarded for much of the work carried out in later times at secondary schools. The names of the final secondary school exams in France and Spain (and increasingly in the UK—the [[International Baccalaureate]]) come from this: le [[Baccalauréat]] and el ''Bachillerato'', respectively.

The [[Ancient Universities of Scotland]] award a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree to humanities or arts graduates, but a B.Sc. to science graduates. This course takes four years for an honours degree and three for an ordinary (in Scotland it is possible to opt to take an ordinary degree rather than this simply ranking below a third class honours).

A Bachelor of Arts is entitled to the designation B.A. for an ordinary/pass degree and B.A. (Hons) for an honours degree. Students who completed an honours B.A. sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' or '(Hons)' after the degree abbreviation in parenthesizes. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, followed by an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An ordinary or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add '(Hons)') may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Typically these degrees lack the last year requirement of a dissertation.
