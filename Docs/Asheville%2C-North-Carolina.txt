==History==
===Origins===
Before the arrival of the Europeans, the land where Asheville now exists lay within the boundaries of the [[Cherokee]] Nation.<ref>{{cite web

The history of Asheville, as a town, began in 1784. In that year, Colonel Samuel Davidson and his family settled in the [[Swannanoa River|Swannanoa Valley]], redeeming a soldier's [[land grant]] from the state of North Carolina. Soon after building a log cabin at the bank of Christian Creek, Davidson was lured into the woods by a band of Cherokee hunters and killed. Davidson's wife, child and female slave fled on foot overnight to [[Old Fort, North Carolina|Davidson's Fort]] (named after Davidson's father General John Davidson) 16&nbsp;miles away.

In response to the killing, Davidson's twin brother Major William Davidson and brother-in-law Colonel Daniel Smith formed an expedition to retrieve Samuel Davidson's body and avenge his murder. Months after the expedition, Major Davidson and other members of his extended family returned to the area and settled at the mouth of Bee Tree Creek.

The [[United States Census]] of 1790 counted 1,000 residents of the area, excluding the Cherokee Native Americans. [[Buncombe County, North Carolina|Buncombe County]] was officially formed in 1792. The county seat, named "Morristown" in 1793, was established on a plateau where two old Indian trails crossed. In 1797, Morristown was incorporated and renamed "Asheville" after North Carolina Governor [[Samuel Ashe (North Carolina)|Samuel Ashe]].<ref>{{cite web

===The Civil War===
Asheville, with a population of approximately 2,500 by 1861, remained relatively untouched by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], but contributed a number of companies to the [[Confederate States Army]], and a substantially smaller number of soldiers to the [[Union Army|Union]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} For a time, an [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfield rifle]] manufacturing facility was located in the town. The war came to Asheville as an afterthought, when the "Battle of Asheville" was fought in early April 1865 at the present-day site of the [[University of North Carolina at Asheville]], with Union forces withdrawing to [[Tennessee]] after encountering resistance from a small group of Confederate senior and junior reserves and recuperating Confederate soldiers in prepared trench lines across the Buncombe Turnpike; orders had been given to the Union force to take Asheville only if this could be accomplished without significant losses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

An engagement was also fought later that month at Swannanoa Gap as part of the larger Stoneman's Raid, with Union forces retreating in the face of resistance from Brig. Gen. Martin, commander of Confederate troops in western North Carolina, but returning to the area via Howard's Gap and [[Henderson County, North Carolina|Henderson County]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} In late April 1865 troops under the overall command of Union Gen. Stoneman captured Asheville. Hartley, Stoneman's Raid, p.&nbsp;362 (Blair, 2010) After a negotiated departure, the troops nevertheless subsequently returned and plundered and burned a number of Confederate supporters' homes in Asheville.<ref>Hartley, supra, at p.&nbsp;350-358.</ref> The years following the war were a time of economic and social hardship in Buncombe County, as throughout most of the defeated South.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===1880s===
On October 2, 1880, the [[Western North Carolina Railroad]] completed its line from Salisbury to Asheville, the first rail line to reach the city. Almost immediately it was sold and resold to the [[Richmond and Danville Railroad|Richmond and Danville Railroad Company]], becoming part of the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] in 1894.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historync.org/railroad-WNCRR.htm |title=NC Business History - Railroad - Western North Carolina Railroad history & officers |publisher=Historync.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> With the completion of the first railway, Asheville experienced a slow but steady growth as industrial plants increased in number and size, and new residents built homes. [[Textile mill]]s were established and plants were set up for the manufacture of wood and [[mica]] products, foodstuffs, and other commodities.<ref>The Federal Writers' Project of the Federal Works Agency, Works Projects Administration for the State of North Carolina, "North Carolina: A Guide to the Old North State", The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1939, page 139.</ref>

The 21-mile distance between Hendersonville and Asheville of the former Asheville and Spartanburg Railroad was completed in 1886.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0Acnj3ga88C&pg=RA1-PA212&lpg=RA1-PA212&dq=%22Spartanburg+and+Asheville+Railroad%22&source=bl&ots=oJyMnLtw25&sig=rOX5DbWNZvyTQmTkqjZjrkVEa5A&hl=en&ei=qnw8TeK_EIH68AbUldHHCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDAQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=%22Spartanburg%20and%20Asheville%20Railroad%22&f=false/|title=Thomas Lanier Clingman|work=google.com}}</ref> By that point, the line was operated as part of the [[Richmond and Danville Railroad]] until 1894 and controlled by the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]] afterward.<ref name="vtechspeccoll">{{cite web | url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/appal/apunindx-1.htm | title=Appalachian History: Manuscript Resources in Special Collections | at=Asheville and Spartanburg Railroad Company | accessdate=6 January 2015 | website=Special Collections | publisher=University Libraries, [[Virginia Tech]] | date=2 May 2005<!--based on last modified--> }}</ref>  (Asheville's final passenger train, a coach-only remnant of the Southern Railway's ''[[Carolina Special]]'', last ran on December 5, 1968.)

Asheville had the first electric street railway lines in the state of North Carolina, the first of which opened in 1889. These would be replaced by buses in 1934.<ref>The Federal Writers' Project of the Federal Works Agency, Works Projects Administration for the State of North Carolina, "North Carolina: A Guide to the Old North State", The University of North Carolina Press, Chapel Hill, 1939, pages 69, 139.</ref>

Asheville prospered in the decades of the 1910s and 1920s and at one point was the third largest city in the state, behind [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. The [[Great Depression]], the period of Asheville's history made world-famous by the novel ''[[Look Homeward, Angel]]'', hit Asheville quite hard. On November 20, 1930, eight local banks failed.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60912F7355C11738DDDA80A94D9415B808FF1D3 | work=The New York Times | title=8 CAROLINA BANKS FAIL AS BOOM ENDS| date=21 November 1930 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> Only [[Wachovia]] remained open with infusions of cash from [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Because of the explosive growth of the previous decades, the per capita [[debt]] owed by the city (through [[municipal bond]]s) was the highest in the nation.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/asheville/preservation.htm |title=Preservation-Asheville, North Carolina: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary |publisher=Nps.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> By 1929, both the city and Buncombe County had incurred over $56 million in bonded debt to pay for a wide range of municipal and infrastructure improvements, including City Hall, the water system, Beaucatcher Tunnel, and [[Asheville High School]]. Rather than default, the city paid those debts over a period of fifty years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Did Asheville pay off its Depression-era debt?|last=Boyle|first=John|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=6 February 2015|page=A2}}</ref> From the start of the depression through the 1980s, economic growth in Asheville was slow. During this time of financial stagnation, most of the buildings in the downtown district remained unaltered. Therefore, Asheville has one of the most impressive, comprehensive collections of [[Art Deco]] architecture in the United States.<ref name="uncramseyabout">{{cite web | url=http://toto.lib.unca.edu/collaborative_projects/about.htm | title=ABOUT | deadurl=yes | archivedate=16 May 2008 | website=D.

On July 15–16, 1916, the Asheville area was subject to severe flooding from the remnants of a [[tropical storm]] which caused more than $3 million in damage. In September 2004, remnants of [[Hurricane Frances|Hurricanes Frances]] and [[Hurricane Ivan|Ivan]] caused major flooding in Asheville, particularly at [[Biltmore Village]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/20/national/20cove.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=Western%20North%20Carolina%20Flooding%202004&st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Marc | last=Santora | title=Storm's Devastation Is Revealed, and a Mountain Hamlet Mourns | date=20 September 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Postelle |first=Brian |url=http://www.mountainx.com/news/2007/101007flood |title=Sleeping giant &#124; Mountain Xpress &#124; Asheville, NC |publisher=Mountainx.com |date=2004-11-10 |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref>

==Geography==
Asheville is located in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] at the [[confluence]] of the [[Swannanoa River]] and the [[French Broad River]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|117.2|sqkm|disp=flip}}, of which {{convert|116.4|sqkm|disp=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.8|sqkm|disp=flip}}, or 0.66%, is water.<ref name="Census 2010"/>

===Climate===
The climate of Asheville is a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), resembling the rest of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region of the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern U.S.]], but with noticeably cooler temperatures due to the higher altitude; it is part of USDA [[Hardiness zone]] 7a.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/ |title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |website=Planthardiness.ars.usda.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-05-22}}</ref> The area's summers in particular, though warm, are not as hot as summers in cities farther east in the state, as the July daily average temperature is {{convert|73.8|°F|1}} and there is an average of only 9.4 days with {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs annually;{{efn|The record number of annual 90&nbsp;°F readings is 32 in 1952, which would be lower than average in most cities in the southeast U.S.<ref name = NOWData/>}} the last time a calendar year has passed without 90&nbsp;°F readings is 2009. Moreover, warm nights where the low remains at or above {{convert|70|°F|0}} are much more uncommon than 90&nbsp;°F temperatures. Winters are cool, with a January daily average of {{convert|37.1|°F|1}} and highs remaining at or below freezing on 5.5&nbsp;days.<ref name = NOWData/>

Official record temperatures range from {{convert|−16|°F|0}} on [[January 1985 Arctic outbreak|January 21, 1985]] to {{convert|100|°F|0}} on August 21, 1983;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/gsp/climate/ahlaug.htm|title=NOAA records for August – Asheville, NC|work=noaa.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/gsp/climate/ahljan.htm|title=NOAA records for January – Asheville, NC|work=noaa.gov}}</ref> the record cold daily maximum is {{convert|4|°F|0}} on February 4, 1895, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is {{convert|77|°F|0}} on July 17, 1887.<ref name = NOWData/> Readings as low as {{convert|0|°F|0}} or as high as {{convert|95|°F|0}} rarely occur, the last occurrences being January 7, 2014 and [[Summer 2012 North American heat wave|July 1, 2012]], respectively.<ref name = NOWData/> The average window for freezing temperatures is October 17 to April 18, allowing a growing season of 181 days.<ref name = NOWData/>

Precipitation is relatively well spread (though the summer months are slightly wetter), and averages {{convert|45.6|in|mm|sigfig=3}} annually, but has historically ranged from {{convert|22.79|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 1925 to {{convert|75.22|in|mm|abbr=on}} in 2013.<ref name = NOWData/>{{efn|The extremely wet summer that year, including the record wettest July, helped the year beat the old record set in 1973 by about {{convert|10.3|in|mm|abbr=on}}.

===Architecture===
[[File:Biltmore Estate.jpg|thumb|Biltmore Estate in 2006]]
Notable architecture in Asheville includes its [[Art Deco]] [[Asheville City Hall|city hall]], and other unique buildings in the downtown area, such as the Battery Park Hotel, the original of which was 475-feet long with numerous [[dormers]] and chimneys; the Neo-Gothic Jackson Building, the first skyscraper on Pack Square; [[Arcade Building (Asheville, North Carolina)|Grove Arcade]], one of America's first indoor shopping malls;<ref>Chase, Nan K.

Asheville's recovery from the Depression was slow and arduous. Because of the financial stagnation, there was little new construction and much of the downtown district remained unaltered. This however has allowed Asheville to be a great collection of Art Deco and truly a style all its own.

The [[Montford Area Historic District]] and other central areas are considered historic districts and include Victorian houses. On the other hand, [[Biltmore Village]], located at the entrance to the famous estate, showcases unique architectural features that are found only in the Asheville area. It was here that workers stayed during the construction of George Vanderbilt's estate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Today, however, as with many of Asheville's historical districts, it has been transformed into a district home to quaint, trendy shops and interesting boutiques.

==Politics==

===Local government===

The City of Asheville operates under a [[Council–manager government|council-manager form of government]], via its charter. The city council appoints a city manager, a city attorney, and a city clerk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashevillenc.gov/Government/AboutCityGovernment.aspx |title=About City Government |publisher=Ashevillenc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-06-29}}</ref> In the absence or disability of the mayor, the vice-mayor performs the mayoral duties. The vice-mayor is appointed by the members of City Council. City Council determines the needs to be addressed and the degree of service to be provided by the administrative branch of city government.

In 2005 Mayor Charles Worley signed the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement and in 2006 the City Council created the Sustainable Advisory Committee on Energy and the Environment.  In 2007 the Council became the first city on the East Coast to commit to building all municipal buildings to [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Gold Standards and to achieve 80 percent energy reduction of 2001 standards by 2040. Also in 2007 the Council signed an agreement with [[Warren Wilson College]] stating the intent of the city and college to work together toward climate partnership goals.

====Controversy====
In 2009, a group of Asheville citizens challenged the legitimacy of [[Cecil Bothwell]]'s election to the City Council,<ref name="Schrader091209">{{cite news|author1=Jordan Schrader|author2=Dale Neal|title=Critics of Cecil Bothwell cite N.C. bar to atheists|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|date=December 8, 2009|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20091208/NEWS01/912080327|accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref> citing the [[North Carolina Constitution]], which does not permit [[Atheism|atheists]] to hold public office.<ref>{{cite web|title=Article VI: Suffrage and Eligibility to Office - Sec. 8.

While the city council elections are non-partisan, party politics may enter into play with both Republican and Democratic counterparts backing their registered members candidacy. An effort by the council to return to partisan elections was defeated by voters in a referendum held in November 2007.

==Sustainability and environmental initiatives==

The city of Asheville is home to a Duke Energy Progress coal power plant near Lake Julian. This power plant is designated as having Coal Combustion Residue Surface Impoundments with a High Hazard Potential by the EPA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/industrial/special/fossil/ccrs-fs/|title=Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) - Surface Impoundments with High Hazard Potential Ratings}}</ref> In 2012 a Duke University study found high levels of arsenic and other toxins in North Carolina lakes and rivers downstream from the Asheville power plants coal ash ponds. Samples collected from coal ash waste flowing from the ponds at the Duke Energy Progress plant to the French Broad River in Buncombe County contained arsenic levels more than four times higher than the EPA drinking water standard, and levels of selenium 17 times higher than the agency's standard for aquatic life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs2.citizen-times.com/outdoors/2012/10/15/duke-university-progess-energy-plant-polluting-french-broad-river/|title=Duke University: Progress Energy plant polluting French Broad River,October 15, 2012}}</ref> In March 2013 the State of North Carolina sued Duke Energy Progress in order to address similar environmental compliance issues. In July 2013 Duke Energy Corp. and North Carolina environmental regulators proposed a settlement in the lawsuit that stated coal ash threatened Asheville's water supply. The settlement called for Duke to assess the sources and extent of contamination at the Riverbend power plant in Asheville. Duke would be fined $99,100 if the settlement is approved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs2.citizen-times.com/outdoors/2013/08/16/nc-files-new-lawsuits-against-duke-energy-today/ |title=NC files new lawsuits against Duke Energy today, August 16, 2013}}</ref> Following the coal ash spill in Eden, NC resulting in 82,000 tons of coal ash leaking into the Dan River, the North Carolina DENR cancelled all previous settlements with Duke Energy.

Duke Energy faces future legislation by [[Tom Apodaca]], republican NCGA Senate leader forcing them to clean up their south Asheville coal ash ponds. [[Tom Apodaca]] expects the legislation will be filed as soon as the General Assembly returns to session in May 2014. Apodaca expects the ponds will be cleaned up in 5–10 years under his law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/article/20140211/NEWS01/302110043?odyssey=mod%7cmostcom|title=Local News - The Asheville Citizen-Times - citizen-times.com|work=The Asheville Citizen-Times}}</ref>
