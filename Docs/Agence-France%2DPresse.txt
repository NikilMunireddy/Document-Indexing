==History==

===Agence Havas===
The ''Agence Havas'' was founded in 1835 by a Parisian translator and advertising agent, [[Charles-Louis Havas]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Daily Newspapers: First in a Series on the French Media|url=http://www.wikileaks.ch/cable/2006/11/06PARIS7251.html|accessdate=7 February 2015|work=Wikileaks|date=6 November 2006}}</ref> as ''[[Havas|Agence Havas]]''. Two of his employees, [[Paul Reuter]] and [[Bernhard Wolff]], later set up rival news agencies in [[London]] and [[Berlin]] respectively, starting 1848. In order to reduce overhead and develop the lucrative advertising side of the business, Havas's sons, who had succeeded him in 1852, signed agreements with Reuter and Wolff, giving each news agency an exclusive reporting zone in different parts of [[Europe]]. This arrangement lasted until the 1930s, when the invention of [[shortwave radio|short-wave wireless]] improved and cut communications costs. To help Havas extend the scope of its reporting at a time of great international tension, the French government financed up to 47% of its investments.

===Agence France-Presse===
In 1940, when German forces occupied France during the [[World War II]], the news agency was taken over by the authorities and renamed "Office Français d'Information" (French Information Office); only the private advertising company retained the name Havas.<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/25728734 L'Office Français d'Information (1940-1944)] {{fr icon}} Revue d'histoire de la Deuxième Guerre mondiale n°101, January 1976</ref> On August 20, 1944, as [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] moved on Paris, a group of journalists in the [[French Resistance]] seized the offices of the FIO and issued the first news dispatch from the liberated city under the name of Agence France-Presse.

Established as a [[state enterprise]], AFP devoted the post-war years to developing its network of international correspondents. One of them was the first Western journalist to report the death of the Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]] on March 6, 1953.
AFP was keen to shake off its semi-official status, and on January 10, 1957 the [[Parliament of France|French Parliament]] passed a law establishing its independence. Since that date, the proportion of the agency's revenues generated by subscriptions from government departments has steadily declined. Such subscriptions represented 115 million Euros in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/budget/plf2012/a3806-tvii.asp#P115_11426|title=N° 3806 tome VII - Avis de M. Michel Françaix sur le projet de loi de finances  pour 2012 (n°3775)|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>

In 1982, the agency began to decentralize its editorial decision-making by setting up the first of its five autonomous regional centres, in Hong Kong, then a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Crown colony]]. Each region has its own budget, [[Administration (business)|administrative director]] and [[Editor-in-chief|chief editor]]. In September 2007, the AFP Foundation was launched to promote higher standards of journalism worldwide. The mission of the AFP "... is' 'defined by its statutes: to report events, free of « all influences or considerations likely to impair the exactitude » of its news and « under no circumstances to pass under the legal or actual control of an ideological, political or economic group."''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fondation.afp.com/?page_id=263|title=Accueil - Fondation AFP|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref>

In 1991, AFP set up a joint venture with [[Extel]] to create a financial news service, [[AFX News]].<ref>AFP and Financial Wires Encroach on Original Market : Reuters News: Clients Defect

In October 2008, the [[Government of France]] announced moves to change AFP's status, including the involvement of outside investors. On November 27 of that year, the main trade unions represented in the company's home base of France - the [[CGT (France)|CGT]], [[Force Ouvrière]], [[Syndicat national des journalistes]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snj.fr/|title=Bienvenue sur le site du SNJ|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> [[Union syndicale des journalistes CFDT]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalistes-cfdt.fr/|title=Actualités|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> and SUD, launched an online petition to oppose what they saw as an attempt to [[privatise]] the agency.

On December 10, 2009, the French Culture Minister [[Frédéric Mitterrand]] announced that he was setting up a Committee of Experts under former AFP CEO Henri Pigeat to study plans for the agency's future status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos-afp.org/en/experts_committee|title=December 2009: Government Sets up Committee to Study Agency's Future|publisher=|accessdate=19 January 2016}}</ref> On February 24, 2010, Pierre Louette unexpectedly announced his intention to resign as CEO by the end of March, and move to a job with [[France Télécom]].

==Statutes==
[[File:Agence France Presse à Paris.jpg|thumb|275px|AFP headquarters in [[Paris]].]]
AFP is a government-chartered [[Public company|public corporation]] operating under a 1957 law,<ref>Translation of AFP's statutes into English (Sept. 2011): http://www.sos-afp.org/en/statutes</ref> but is officially a commercial business independent of the [[Politics of France|French government]]. AFP is administered by a [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and a board comprising 15 members:
* Eight representatives of the French [[Mass media|press]];
* Two representatives of the AFP personnel;
* Two representatives of the government-owned radio and television;
* Three representatives of the government. One is named by the [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]], another by the [[Minister of Finance (France)|minister of finance]], and a third by the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|minister of foreign affairs]].

The board elects the CEO for a renewable term of three years. The AFP also has a council charged with ensuring that the agency operates according to its statutes, which mandate absolute [[independence]] and neutrality. Editorially, AFP is governed by a network of senior journalists.

The primary client of AFP is the French government, which purchases subscriptions for its various services. In practice, those subscriptions are an indirect [[subsidy]] to AFP. The statutes of the agency prohibit direct government subsidies.
