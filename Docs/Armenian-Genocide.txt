== Background ==
{{Main |Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Armenian population}}

=== Armenians under Ottoman rule ===
Armenia had come largely under Ottoman rule during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The vast majority of Armenians, grouped together under the name Armenian ''[[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]'' (community) and led by their spiritual head, the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]], were concentrated in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire (commonly referred to as Turkish Armenia or [[Western Armenia]]), although large communities were also found in the western provinces, as well as in the capital [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. The Armenian community was made up of three religious denominations: the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] to which the overwhelming majority of Armenians belonged, and the [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] and [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Protestant]] communities. Through the millet system, the Armenian community were allowed to rule themselves under their own system of governance with fairly little interference from the Ottoman government. With the exception of the empire's urban centers and the extremely wealthy, Constantinople-based ''Amira'' class, a social elite whose members included the Duzians (Directors of the Imperial Mint), the [[Balyan family|Balyans]] (Chief Imperial Architects) and the [[Dadian family|Dadians]] (Superintendent of the Gunpowder Mills and manager of industrial factories), most Armenians – approximately 70% of their population – lived in poor and dangerous conditions in the rural countryside.<ref>{{Citation | author-link = Hagop Barsoumian| last = Barsoumian | first = Hagop | year = 1982 | contribution = The Dual Role of the Armenian Amira Class within the Ottoman Government and the Armenian Millet (1750–1850) | title = Christians and Jews in the Ottoman Empire: The Functioning of a Plural Society | volume = I | editor1-first = Benjamin | editor1-last = Braude | editor2-first = Bernard | editor2-last = Lewis | place = New York | publisher = Holmes & Meier}}</ref><ref name = "Barsoumian">{{Citation | last = Barsoumian | first = Hagop | year = 1997 | contribution = The Eastern Question and the Tanzimat Era | title = The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times | volume = II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century | editor-first = Richard G | editor-last = Hovannisian | editor-link = Richard G.

According to the latter, there were almost three million Armenians living in the empire in 1878 (400,000 in Constantinople and the [[Balkans]], 600,000 in Asia Minor and [[Cilicia]], 670,000 in [[Lesser Armenia]] and the area near [[Kayseri]], and 1,300,000 in Western Armenia itself).<ref>{{hy icon}} Hambaryan, Azat S.

In the eastern provinces, the Armenians were subject to the whims of their Turkish and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] neighbors, who would regularly overtax them, subject them to [[brigandage]] and kidnapping, force them to convert to Islam, and otherwise exploit them without interference from central or local authorities.<ref name = "Barsoumian" /> In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the ''[[dhimmi]]'' system implemented in [[Islam|Muslim]] countries, they, like all other Christians and also Jews, were accorded certain freedoms. The dhimmi system in the Ottoman Empire was largely based upon the [[Pact of Umar]]. The client status established the rights of the non-Muslims to property, livelihood and freedom of worship but they were in essence treated as [[second-class citizen]]s in the empire and referred to in Turkish as ''[[Giaour|gavours]]'', a pejorative word meaning "[[infidel]]" or "[[unbeliever]]". While the Pact of Umar prohibited non-Muslims from building new places of worship, it was not enforced in all regions of the Ottoman Empire. Since there were no laws concerning religious ghettos, the prohibition of non-Muslims building new places of worship led to their clustering around existing ones.<ref name="́gostonMasters2010">{{cite book|last1=A ́goston|first1=Ga ́bor|last2=Alan Masters|first2=Bruce|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&pg=PA185|accessdate=15 April 2016|year=2010|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7|pages=185–6}}</ref><ref name = "Balakian">{{Cite book | authorlink = Peter Balakian| last = Balakian | first = Peter | title = The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response | place = New York | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-06-019840-0 | pages = 25, 445}}</ref> Writing in the late 1890s after a visit to the Ottoman Empire, the British ethnographer [[William Mitchell Ramsay|William Ramsay]] described the conditions of Armenian life as follows:

In addition to other legal limitations, Christians were not considered equals to Muslims and several prohibitions were placed on them. Their testimony against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law wherein a Muslim could be punished; this meant that their testimony could only be considered in commercial cases. They were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses and camels. Their houses could not overlook those of Muslims; and their religious practices were severely circumscribed (e.g., the ringing of church bells was strictly forbidden).<ref name="́gostonMasters2010"/><ref name = "Akçam">{{Cite book | first = Taner | last = Akçam | authorlink = Taner Akçam | title = A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility | place = New York | publisher = Metropolitan Books | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-8050-7932-7}}</ref>

=== Reform implementation, 1840s–80s ===
{{Main|Armenian Question}}
[[File:Ethnic map of Asia Minor and Caucasus in 1914.jpg|thumb|German ethnographic map of [[Asia Minor]] and [[Caucasus]] in 1914. Armenians are labeled in blue.]]

In the mid-19th century, the three major European powers, Great Britain, France and Russia, began to question the Empire's treatment of its Christian minorities and pressure it to grant equal rights to all its subjects. From 1839 to the declaration of a constitution in 1876, the Ottoman government instituted the [[Tanzimat]], a series of reforms designed to improve the status of minorities. Nevertheless, most of the reforms were never implemented because the empire's Muslim population rejected the principle of equality for Christians. By the late 1870s, the [[Greeks]], along with several other Christian nations in the [[Balkans]], frustrated with their conditions, had, often with the help of the [[great power]]s, broken free of Ottoman rule. The Armenians remained, by and large, passive during these years, earning them the title of ''millet-i sadika'' or the "loyal millet".<ref name="Dadrian">{{cite book |authorlink=Vahakn Dadrian |last=Dadrian |first=Vahakn N |title=The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus |place=Oxford |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=1995 |isbn=1-57181-666-6}}</ref>

In the mid-1860s and early 1870s this passivity gave way to new currents of thinking in Armenian society. Led by intellectuals educated at European universities or American missionary schools in Turkey, Armenians began to question their second-class status and press for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal Council petitioned the Ottoman government to redress their principal grievances: "the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]], improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial". The Ottoman government considered these grievances and promised to punish those responsible, though no meaningful steps were ever taken.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |36}}

Following the violent suppression of Christians in the uprisings in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] in 1875, the Great Powers invoked the 1856 [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] by claiming that it gave them the right to intervene and protect the Ottoman Empire's Christian minorities.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |35ff}} Under growing pressure, the government of [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] declared itself a constitutional monarchy with a parliament (which was almost immediately [[Legislative session#Common procedure|prorogued]]) and entered into negotiations with the powers. At the same time, the Armenian patriarch of Constantinople, Nerses II, forwarded Armenian complaints of widespread "forced land seizure&nbsp;... forced conversion of women and children, arson, [[Protection racket|protection extortion]], rape, and murder" to the Powers.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |37}}

The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 ended with Russia's decisive victory and its army in occupation of large parts of eastern Turkey, but not before entire Armenian districts had been devastated by massacres carried out with the connivance of Ottoman authorities. In the wake of these events, Patriarch Nerses and his emissaries made repeated approaches to Russian leaders to urge the inclusion of a clause granting local self-government to the Armenians in the forthcoming [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. The Russians were receptive and drew up the clause, but the Ottomans flatly rejected it during negotiations. In its place, the two sides agreed on a clause making the [[Sublime Porte]]'s implementation of reforms in the Armenian provinces a condition of Russia's withdrawal, thus designating Russia the guarantor of the reforms.<ref>{{citation |title=[[Treaty of San Stefano]] |quote=As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia&nbsp;... might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the [[Sublime Porte]] engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from Kurds and [[Circassians]]. |chapter=Article 16}}</ref> The clause entered the treaty as Article 16 and marked the first appearance of what came to be known in European diplomacy as the Armenian question.

On receiving a copy of the treaty, Britain promptly objected to it and particularly Article 16, which it saw as ceding too much influence to Russia. It immediately pushed for a congress of the great powers to be convened to discuss and revise the treaty, leading to the [[Congress of Berlin]] in June–July 1878. Patriarch Nerses sent a delegation led by his distinguished predecessor, Archbishop [[Khrimian Hayrik]], to speak for the Armenians, but it was not admitted into the sessions on the grounds that it did not represent a country. Confined to the periphery, the delegation did its best to contact the representatives of the powers and argue the case for Armenian administrative autonomy within the Ottoman Empire, but to little effect.

Following an understanding reached with Ottoman representatives, Britain drew up an emasculated version of Article 16 to replace the original, a clause that retained the call for reforms but omitted any reference to the Russian occupation, thereby dispensing with the principal guarantee of their implementation. Despite an ambiguous reference to great power supervision, the clause failed to offset the removal of the Russian guarantee with any tangible equivalent, thus leaving the timing and fate of the reforms to the discretion of the Sublime Porte.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp|38,39}} The clause was readily adopted as Article 61 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] on the last day of the Congress, to the deep disappointment of the Armenian delegation.

=== Armenian national liberation movement ===
{{Main |Armenian national liberation movement}}
Prospects for reforms faded rapidly following the signing of the Berlin treaty, as security conditions in the Armenian provinces went from bad to worse and abuses proliferated. Upset with this turn of events, a number of disillusioned Armenian intellectuals living in Europe and Russia decided to form political parties and societies dedicated to the betterment of their compatriots in the Ottoman Empire. In the last quarter of the 19th century, this movement came to be dominated by three parties: the [[Armenakan Party|Armenakan]], whose influence was limited to Van, the [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]], and the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Dashnaktsutiun). Ideological differences aside, all the parties had the common goal of achieving better social conditions for the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire through self-defense<ref>{{Citation | last = Nalbandian | first = Louise | title = The Armenian Revolutionary Movement: The Development of Armenian Political Parties through the Nineteenth Century | place = Berkeley | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1963}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Libaridian | first = Gerard | contribution = What was Revolutionary about Armenian Revolutionary Parties in the Ottoman Empire? | title = A Question of Genocide: Armenians and Turks at the End of the Ottoman Empire | editor-link = Ronald Grigor Suny | editor-first = Ronald | editor-last = Suny | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2011 | pages = 82–112|display-editors=etal}}</ref> and advocating increased European pressure on the Ottoman government to implement the promised reforms.

=== Hamidian massacres, 1894–96 ===
{{Main|Hamidian massacres}}

[[File:1895erzurum-victims.jpg|thumb|Corpses of massacred Armenians in [[Erzurum]] in 1895]]

Since 1876, the Ottoman state had been led by Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. Immediately after the Treaty of Berlin was signed, Abdul Hamid attempted to forestall implementation of its reform provisions by asserting that Armenians did not make up a majority in the provinces and that their reports of abuses were largely exaggerated or false. In 1890, Abdul Hamid created a paramilitary outfit known as the ''[[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]]'' which was mostly made up of Kurdish irregulars who were tasked to "deal with the Armenians as they wished".<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |40}} As Ottoman officials intentionally provoked rebellions (often as a result of over-taxation) in Armenian populated towns, such as in [[1894 Sasun rebellion|Sasun]] in 1894 and [[1894 Sasun rebellion|Zeitun]] in 1895–96, these regiments were increasingly used to deal with the Armenians by way of oppression and massacre. In some instances Armenians successfully fought off the regiments and in 1895 brought the excesses to the attention of the Great Powers, who subsequently condemned the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]].<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |40–2}}

In October 1895, the Powers forced Abdul Hamid to sign a new reform package designed to curtail the powers of the Hamidiye but, like the Berlin Treaty, it was never implemented. On 1 October 1895, 2,000 Armenians assembled in Constantinople to petition for the implementation of the reforms, but Ottoman police units converged on the rally and violently broke it up.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |57–8}} Soon, massacres of Armenians broke out in Constantinople and then engulfed the rest of the Armenian-populated provinces of [[Bitlis]], [[Diyarbekir]], [[Erzurum]], [[Harput]], [[Sivas]], [[Trabzon]], and [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. Estimates differ on how many Armenians were killed but European documentation of the [[pogroms]], which became known as the [[Hamidian massacres]], placed the figures at between 100,000 and 300,000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Armenian Genocide|url=http://www.history.com/topics/armenian-genocide|website=history.com|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]}}</ref><ref>The German Foreign Ministry operative, Ernst Jackh, estimated that 200,000 Armenians were killed and a further 50,000 expelled from the provinces during the Hamidian unrest. French diplomats placed the figures at 250,000 killed. The German pastor [[Johannes Lepsius]] was more meticulous in his calculations, counting the deaths of 88,000&nbsp;Armenians and the destruction of 2,500&nbsp;villages, 645&nbsp;churches and monasteries, and the plundering of hundreds of churches, of which 328 were converted into mosques.</ref>

Although Hamid was never directly implicated in ordering the massacres, it is believed that they had his tacit approval.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |42}} Frustrated with European indifference to the massacres, a group of members of the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] [[1896 Ottoman Bank Takeover|seized]] the European-managed [[Ottoman Bank]] on 26 August 1896. This incident brought further sympathy for Armenians in Europe and was lauded by the European and American press, which vilified Hamid and painted him as the "great assassin", "bloody Sultan", and "[[Abdul the Damned]]".<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |35,115}} While the Great Powers vowed to take action and enforce new reforms, these never came to fruition due to conflicting political and economic interests.

=== The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 ===
{{Main|Young Turk Revolution}}
[[File:Ottoman Armenians 1908.jpg|thumb|Armenians of [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] celebrating the establishment of the [[Committee of Union and Progress|CUP]] government.]]

On 24 July 1908, Armenians' hopes for equality in the empire brightened once more when a [[coup d'état]] staged by officers in the Ottoman [[Third Army (Ottoman Empire)|Third Army]] based in [[Salonika]] removed Abdul Hamid II from power and restored the country to a constitutional monarchy. The officers were part of the [[Young Turks|Young Turk]] movement that wanted to reform administration of the perceived [[Decadence|decadent]] state of the Ottoman Empire and modernize it to European standards.<ref>{{cite web|title = Young Turk Revolution|url = http://matrix.msu.edu/hst/fisher/HST150/unit6/mod/young_turk_revolution.html|website = matrix.msu.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-13}}</ref> The movement was an anti-Hamidian coalition made up of two distinct groups: the liberal [[constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] and the nationalists; the former were more democratic and accepted Armenians into their wing whereas the latter group was more intolerant in regard to Armenian-related issues and their frequent requests for European assistance.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |140–1}} In 1902, during a congress of the Young Turks held in Paris, the heads of the liberal wing, [[Prens Sabahaddin|Sabahaddin]] and [[Ahmed Riza]] Bey, partially persuaded the nationalists to include in their objectives ensuring some rights for all the minorities of the empire.

One of the numerous factions within the Young Turk movement was a secret revolutionary organization called the ''[[Committee of Union and Progress]]'' (CUP). It drew its membership from disaffected army officers based in [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]] and was behind a wave of mutinies against the central government. In 1908, elements of the Third Army and the Second Army Corps declared their opposition to the Sultan and threatened to march on the capital to depose him. Hamid, shaken by the wave of resentment, stepped down from power as [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]], [[Assyrians]], [[Arab]]s, [[Bulgarians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] alike rejoiced in his dethronement.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |143–4}}

=== The Adana massacre of 1909 ===
{{Main|Adana massacre}}
[[File:AdanaChristianQuarter.jpg|thumb|The Armenian quarter after the massacres in [[Adana]] in 1909.]]

A [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909|countercoup took place]] in early 1909, ultimately resulting in the [[31 March Incident]] on 13 April 1909. Some reactionary Ottoman military elements, joined by [[Islamism|Islamic]] [[theological]] students, aimed to return control of the country to the Sultan and the rule of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Riots and fighting broke out between the reactionary forces and CUP forces, until the CUP was able to put down the uprising and [[court-martial]] the opposition leaders.

While the movement initially targeted the Young Turk government, it spilled over into pogroms against Armenians who were perceived as having supported the restoration of the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|constitution]].<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |68–9}} When Ottoman Army troops were called in, many accounts record that instead of trying to quell the violence they actually took part in pillaging Armenian enclaves in [[Adana]] province.<ref name=daysof>{{cite news |title=Days of horror described; American missionary an eyewitness of murder and rapine |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A0CE3D71131E733A2575BC2A9629C946897D6CF |date=28 April 1909 |work=New York Times}}</ref> The number of Armenians killed in the course of the [[Adana massacre]] ranged between 15,000 and 30,000 people.<ref name="Akçam" />{{rp |69}}<ref name= 30t>{{cite news |title=30,000 Killed in massacres; Conservative estimate of victims of Turkish fanaticism in Adana Vilayet |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A06E1D8173EE033A25756C2A9629C946897D6CF |date=25 April 1909 |work=New York Times}}</ref>

=== The Balkan Wars ===
In 1912, the [[First Balkan War]] broke out and ended with the defeat of the Ottoman Empire as well as the loss of 85% of its European territory. Many in the empire saw their defeat as "Allah's divine punishment for a society that did not know how to pull itself together".<ref name = "Akçam"/>{{rp |84}} The Turkish nationalist movement in the country gradually came to view [[Anatolia]] as their last refuge. That the Armenian population formed a significant minority in this region later figured prominently in the calculations of the [[Three Pashas]], who carried out the Armenian Genocide.

An important consequence of the [[Balkan Wars]] was also the mass expulsion of Muslims (known as ''[[muhacir]]s'') from the Balkans. Beginning in the mid-19th century, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Circassians]], and [[Chechens]], were expelled or forced to flee from the Caucasus and the Balkans ([[Rumelia]]) as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars and the conflicts in the Balkans. Muslim society in the empire was incensed by this flood of refugees. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times: "Let this be a warning&nbsp;... O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your blood cool before taking revenge".<ref name = "Akçam"/>{{rp |86}} As many as 850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians were resident from the period of 1878–1904. The ''muhacirs'' resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and, as historian [[Taner Akçam]] and others have noted, the refugees came to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the [[Confiscated Armenian properties in Turkey|confiscation of their properties]] during the genocide.<ref name = "Akçam"/>{{rp |86–87}}

== World War I ==
{{See also|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}
On 2 November 1914, the Ottoman Empire opened the Middle Eastern theater of World War I by entering hostilities on the side of the [[Central Powers]] and against the [[Allies]]. The battles of the [[Caucasus Campaign]], the [[Persian Campaign]] and the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] affected several populous Armenian centers. Before entering the war, the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] had sent representatives to the [[Armenian congress at Erzurum]] to persuade Ottoman Armenians to facilitate its conquest of [[Transcaucasia]] by inciting an insurrection of Russian Armenians against the Russian army in the event a [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]] was opened.<ref name = "Akçam"/>{{rp |136}}<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Walker | first1 = Christopher J | authorlink = Christopher J.

=== Battle of Sarikamish ===
{{Main|Battle of Sarikamish}}
{{See also|Caucasus Campaign}}
On 24 December 1914, Minister of War [[Enver Pasha]] implemented a plan to encircle and destroy the Russian [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Caucasus Army]] at [[Sarikamish]] in order to regain territories lost to Russia after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877–78. Enver Pasha's forces were routed in the battle, and almost completely destroyed. Returning to Constantinople, Enver Pasha publicly blamed his defeat on Armenians in the region having actively sided with the Russians.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |200}}

=== Directive 8682, 25 February ===
{{Further2|[[Ottoman labour battalions]]}}

On 25 February 1915, the Ottoman General Staff released the War Minister Enver Pasha's ''Directive 8682'' on "Increased security and precautions" to all military units calling for the removal of all ethnic Armenians serving in the Ottoman forces from their posts and for their demobilization. They were assigned to the unarmed [[Labour battalion]]s (Turkish: ''amele taburlari''). The directive accused the Armenian Patriarchate of releasing State secrets to the Russians. Enver Pasha explained this decision as "out of fear that they would collaborate with the Russians".<ref>{{harvnb|Suny|2015|pp=244}}</ref> Traditionally, the Ottoman Army only drafted non-Muslim males between the ages of 20 and 45 into the regular army. The younger (15–20) and older (45–60) non-Muslim soldiers had always been used as logistical support through the labour battalions. Before February, some of the Armenian recruits were utilized as labourers (''hamals''), though they would ultimately be executed.<ref>Toynbee, Arnold. ''Armenian Atrocities: The Murder of a Nation''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1915, pp. 181–2.</ref>

Transferring Armenian conscripts from active combat to passive, unarmed logistic sections was an important precursor to the subsequent genocide. As reported in ''[[The Memoirs of Naim Bey]]'', the execution of the Armenians in these battalions was part of a premeditated strategy of the CUP. Many of these Armenian recruits were executed by local Turkish gangs.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |178}}

=== Van, April 1915 ===
{{Further2|[[Defense of Van (1915)|Siege of Van]]}}
[[File:Van Defenders.jpg|thumb|Armed Armenian civilians and self-defense units during the [[Defense of Van (1915)|Siege of Van]] in April–May 1915]]

On 19 April 1915, [[Jevdet Bey]] demanded that the [[city of Van]] immediately furnish him 4,000&nbsp;soldiers under the pretext of [[conscription]]. However, it was clear to the Armenian population that his goal was to massacre the able-bodied men of Van so that there would be no defenders. Jevdet Bey had already used his official writ in nearby villages, ostensibly to search for arms, but in fact to initiate wholesale massacres.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |202}} The Armenians offered five hundred soldiers and exemption money for the rest in order to buy time, but Jevdet Bey accused the Armenians of "rebellion" and asserted his determination to "crush" it at any cost. "If the rebels fire a single shot", he declared, "I shall kill every Christian man, woman, and" (pointing to his knee) "every child, up to here".<ref name="Morgenthau">{{cite book|last=Morgenthau|first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Morgenthau, Sr.|title=Ambassador Morgenthau's Story: A Personal Account of the Armenian Genocide|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NCy21PiWEbIC|accessdate=15 April 2016|year=2010|origyear=First published 1918|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|isbn=978-1-61640-396-6}}</ref>{{rp|205}}

The next day, 20 April 1915, the siege of Van began when an Armenian woman was harassed, and the two Armenian men who came to her aid were killed by Ottoman soldiers. The Armenian defenders protected the 30,000&nbsp;residents and 15,000&nbsp;refugees living in an area of roughly one square kilometer of the Armenian Quarter and suburb of Aigestan with 1,500&nbsp;ablebodied riflemen who were supplied with 300&nbsp;rifles and 1,000&nbsp;pistols and antique weapons. The conflict lasted until [[General Yudenich]] of Russia came to their rescue.<ref>{{cite book |last = Hinterhoff |first = Eugene |title =Persia: The Stepping Stone To India. Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I | volume = iv |pages = 153–57}}</ref>

Reports of the conflict reached then [[United States Ambassador to Turkey|United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire]] [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]] from [[Aleppo]] and Van, prompting him to raise the issue in person with Talaat and Enver. As he quoted to them the testimonies of his consulate officials, they justified the deportations as necessary to the conduct of the war, suggesting that complicity of the Armenians of Van with the Russian forces that had taken the city justified the persecution of all ethnic Armenians.

=== Arrest and deportation of Armenian notables, April 1915 ===
{{Further2|[[Deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915]]}}
[[File:April24Victims.jpg|thumb|Some Armenian intellectuals arrested on April 24, 1915, and following weeks, then deported and killed.]]

By 1914, Ottoman authorities had already begun a propaganda drive to present Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire as a threat to the empire's security. An [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman naval]] officer in the War Office described the planning:

{{quote |In order to justify this enormous crime the requisite propaganda material was thoroughly prepared in Istanbul. [It included such statements as] 'the Armenians are in league with the enemy.

On the night of 23–24 April 1915, known as [[Red Sunday]] ({{lang-hy|Կարմիր Կիրակի}} ''Garmir Giragi''), the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] rounded up and imprisoned an estimated [[Deportation of Armenian notables in 1915|250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders]] of the Ottoman capital, [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], and later those in other centers, who were moved to two holding centers near Ankara.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |211–2}} This date coincided with Allied troop landings at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] after unsuccessful [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|Allied naval attempts to break through the Dardanelles]] to Constantinople in February and March 1915.

In May 1915, [[Mehmet Talaat Pasha]] requested that the cabinet and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Said Halim Pasha]] legalize a measure for the deportation of Armenians to other places due to what Talaat Pasha called "the Armenian riots and massacres, which had arisen in a number of places in the country". However, Talaat Pasha was referring specifically to events in [[Defense of Van (1915)|Van]] and extending the implementation to the regions in which alleged "riots and massacres" would affect the security of the war zone of the [[Caucasus Campaign]]. Later, the scope of the deportation was widened in order to include the Armenians in the other provinces.

On 29 May 1915, the CUP Central Committee passed the [[Tehcir Law|Temporary Law of Deportation]] ("Tehcir Law"), giving the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] and military authorization to deport anyone it "sensed" as a threat to national security.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |186–8}}

Naturally, the death rate from starvation and sickness is very high and is increased by the brutal treatment of the authorities, whose bearing toward the exiles as they are being driven back and forth over the desert is not unlike that of slave drivers.

A network of 25 concentration camps was set up by the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] to dispose of the Armenians who had survived the deportations to their ultimate point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imprescriptible.fr/rhac/tome2/|title=L'extermination des déportés Arméniens ottomans dans les camps de concentration de Syrie-Mésopotamie (1915-1916)|work=imprescriptible.fr|language=French}}</ref> This network, situated in the region of Turkey's present-day borders with Iraq and Syria, was directed by [[Şükrü Kaya]], one of Talaat Pasha's right-hand men.

Bernau, an American citizen of German descent, traveled to the areas where Armenians were incarcerated and wrote a report that was deemed factual by Rössler, the German Consul at Aleppo. He reports mass graves containing over 60,000 people in [[Meskene]] and large numbers of mounds of corpses, as the Armenians died due to hunger and disease. He reported seeing 450 orphans, who received at most 150 grams of bread per day, in a tent of 5–6 square meters. [[Dysentery]] swept through the camp and days passed between the instances of distribution of bread to some. In "Abu Herrera", near Meskene, he described how the guards let 240 Armenians starve, and wrote that they searched "horse droppings" for grains.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gust|first1=Wolfgang|title=The Armenian Genocide: Evidence from the German Foreign Office Archives, 1915-191|date=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9781782381433|pages=653–4}}</ref>

===Confiscation of property===
{{See also|Confiscated Armenian property in Turkey}}
The Tehcir Law brought some measures regarding the property of the deportees, but in September a new law was proposed. By means of the "Abandoned Properties" Law (Law Concerning Property, Dept's and Assets Left Behind Deported Persons, also referred as the "Temporary Law on Expropriation and Confiscation"), the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] took possession of all "abandoned" Armenian goods and properties. Ottoman parliamentary representative [[Ahmed Riza]] protested this legislation:

{{quote|It is unlawful to designate the Armenian assets as "abandoned goods" for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily removed from their domiciles and exiled.

=== Trials ===

==== Turkish courts-martial ====
{{Main|Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–20}}

On the night of 2–3 November 1918 and with the aid of [[Ahmed Izzet Pasha]], the ''[[Three Pashas]]'' (which include Mehmed Talaat Pasha and Ismail Enver, the main perpetrators of the Genocide) fled the Ottoman Empire.

In 1919, after the [[Armistice of Mudros|Mudros Armistice]], Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] was ordered to organise courts-martial by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied administration]] in charge of Constantinople to try members of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) (Turkish: "''Ittihat Terakki''") for taking the Ottoman Empire into World War I. By January 1919, a report to Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] accused over 130 suspects, most of whom were high officials.

Sultan [[Mehmet VI]] and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Damat Ferid Pasha]], as representatives of [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|government]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Second Constitutional Era]], were summoned to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] by [[US Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]]. On 11 July 1919, [[Damat Ferid Pasha]] officially confessed to massacres against the [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]] and was a key figure and initiator of the war crime [[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–20|trials]] held directly after World War I to condemn to death the chief perpetrators of the Genocide.<ref>Gunnar Heinsohn: Lexikon der Völkermorde.

[[United States Government Printing Office]]. Retrieved 21 January 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.qgazette.com/weekinreview/75979 Armenian Genocide Survivors Remember]. Queens Gazette. Retrieved 21 January 2013</ref> The military court found that it was the will of the CUP to eliminate the Armenians physically, via its [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)|Special Organization]]. The 1919 pronouncement reads as follows:

<blockquote>[[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–20|The Court Martial]] taking into consideration the above-named crimes declares, unanimously, the culpability as principal factors of these crimes the fugitives Talaat Pasha, former Grand Vizir, Enver Efendi, former War Minister, struck off the register of the Imperial Army, Cemal Efendi, former Navy Minister, struck off too from the Imperial Army, and Dr. Nazim Efendi, former Minister of Education, members of the General Council of the Union & Progress, representing the moral person of that party;&nbsp;... the Court Martial pronounces, in accordance with said stipulations of the Law the death penalty against Talaat, Enver, Cemal, and Dr. Nazim.</blockquote>

After the pronouncement, the ''[[Three Pashas]]'' were sentenced to death in absentia at the trials in Constantinople. The courts-martial officially disbanded the CUP and confiscated its assets and the assets of those found guilty. The courts-martial were dismissed in August 1920 for their lack of transparency, according to then High Commissioner and Admiral Sir [[John de Robeck]],<ref name="doc136069">Public Record Office, Foreign Office, 371/4174/136069 in {{harvnb|Dadrian|1995|p=342}}</ref> and some of the accused were transported to [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]] for further interrogation, only to be released afterwards in an exchange of [[POW]]s. Two of the three Pashas were later assassinated by Armenian vigilantes during [[Operation Nemesis]].

==== Prosecution in Malta ====
{{Main|Effort to prosecute Ottoman war criminals|Malta exiles}}

Ottoman military members and high-ranking politicians convicted by the [[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–20|Turkish courts-martial]] were transferred from Constantinople prisons to the [[Crown Colony of Malta]] on board of the SS ''Princess Ena'' and the SS HMS ''Benbow'' by the British forces, starting in 1919. Admiral Sir [[Somerset Gough-Calthorpe]] was in charge of the operation, together with Lord Curzon; they did so owing to the lack of transparency of the Turkish courts-martial. They were held there for three years, while searches were made of archives in Constantinople, London, Paris and Washington to find a way to put them in trial.<ref>Türkei By Klaus-Detlev. Grothusen.</ref> However, the war criminals were eventually released without trial and returned to Constantinople in 1921, in exchange for twenty-two British [[POW|prisoners of war]] held by the government in Ankara, including a relative of Lord Curzon. The government in Ankara was opposed to political power of the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|government in Constantinople]]. They are often mentioned as the ''Malta exiles'' in some sources.{{sfn|Bonello|2008}}

Meanwhile, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference in Paris]] established the "''Commission on Responsibilities and Sanctions''" in January 1919, which was commissioned by United States Secretary of State [[Robert Lansing]]. Based on the commission's work, several articles were added to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]]. The Treaty of Sèvres had planned a trial in August 1920 to determine those responsible for the "barbarous and illegitimate methods of warfare&nbsp;... [including] offenses against the laws and customs of war and the principles of humanity".<ref name="nazi" /> Article 230 of the Treaty of Sèvres required the Ottoman Empire "hand over to the Allied Powers the persons whose surrender may be required by the latter as being responsible for the massacres committed during the continuance of the state of war on territory which formed part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] on August 1, 1914".

According to [[European Court of Human Rights]] judge [[Giovanni Bonello]] the suspension of prosecutions, the repatriation and release of Turkish detainees was amongst others a result of the lack of an appropriate legal framework with [[Jurisdiction|supranational jurisdiction]], because following World War I no international norms for regulating war crimes existed, due to a legal vacuum in international law; therefore contrary to Turkish sources, no trials were ever held in Malta. He mentions that the release of the Turkish detainees was accomplished in exchange for twenty-two British prisoners held by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.{{sfn|Bonello|2008}}<ref name=gbonello>[http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2012-04-19/news/turkeys-eu-minister-judge-giovanni-bonello-and-the-armenian-genocide-claim-about-malta-trials-is-nonsense-308828/ Turkey’s EU Minister, Judge Giovanni Bonello And the Armenian Genocide - ‘Claim about Malta Trials is nonsense’].

==== Trial of Soghomon Tehlirian ====

On 15 March 1921, former [[Grand Vizier]] [[Talaat Pasha]] was assassinated in the [[Charlottenburg]] District of Berlin, Germany, in broad daylight and in the presence of many witnesses. Talaat's death was part of "''[[Operation Nemesis]]''", the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]'s codename for their covert operation in the 1920s to kill the [[Young Turks|planners]] of the Armenian Genocide.

The subsequent trial and acquitment of the assassin, [[Soghomon Tehlirian]], had an important influence on [[Raphael Lemkin]], a lawyer of [[Poles|Polish]]–[[Jewish]] descent who campaigned in the [[League of Nations]] to ban what he called "barbarity" and "vandalism".

According to documents that once belonged to Talaat Pasha, more than 970,000 Ottoman Armenians disappeared from official population records from 1915 through 1916. In 1983, Talaat's widow, Hayriye Talaat Bafralı, gave the documents and records to Turkish journalist [[Murat Bardakçı]], who published them in a book titled ''The Remaining Documents of Talat Pasha'' (also known as "Talat Pasha's Black Book"). According to the documents, the number of Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire before 1915 stood at 1,256,000. It was presumed, however, in a footnote by Talaat Pasha himself, that the Armenian population was undercounted by thirty percent. Furthermore, the population of Protestant Armenians was not taken into account. Therefore, according to the historian [[Ara Sarafian]], the population of Armenians should have been approximately 1,700,000 prior to the start of the war.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sarafian|first1=Ara|title=Talaat Pasha’s Black Book documents his campaign of race extermination, 1915–17|url=http://www.armeniancause.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/N1-new.pdf|agency=The Armenian Reporter|publisher=Armenian Cause Foundation|date=13 March 2009}}</ref> However, that number had plunged to 284,157 two years later in 1917.<ref>Tavernise, Sabrina "[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/world/europe/09turkey.html?em Nearly a Million Genocide Victims, Covered in a Cloak of Amnesia]".

[[Justin McCarthy (American historian)|Justin McCarthy]] calculated an estimate of the pre-war Armenian population, then subtracted his estimate of survivors, arriving at a figure of a little less than 600,000 for Armenian casualties for the period 1914 to 1922.<ref>Justin McCarthy, ''The End of Ottoman Anatolia'', in ''Muslims and Minorities: The Population of Ottoman Anatolia and the End of the Empire'', New York Univ. Press, 1983.</ref> In a more recent essay, he projected that if the Armenian records of 1913 were accurate, 250,000 more deaths should be added, for a total of 850,000.<ref>Justin McCarthy, ''The Population of the Ottoman Armenians'', in ''The Armenians in the Late Ottoman Period'', The Turkish Historical Society For The Council Of Culture, Arts And Publications Of The Grand National Assembly Of Turkey, Ankara, 2001, pp.&nbsp;65–86</ref>

However, McCarthy's numbers have been highly contested by many specialists. Some of them, like Frédéric Paulin, have severely criticized McCarthy's [[methodology]] and suggest that it is flawed.<ref>Frédéric Paulin, ''Négationnisme et théorie des populations stables : le cas du génocide arménien'', in Hervé Lebras (dir.), ''L'Invention des populations.

=== The U.S. Mission in the Ottoman Empire ===
[[File:AmbassadorMorgenthautelegram.jpg|thumb|left|Telegram sent by Ambassador [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]] to the [[State Department]] on 16 July 1915]]

The United States had consulates throughout the Ottoman Empire, including locations in [[Edirne]], [[Elâzığ]], [[Samsun]], [[İzmir]], [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], Van, [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], and [[Aleppo]]. It was officially a neutral party until it joined the Allies in April 1917. In addition to the consulates, there were numerous American [[Protestant]] [[missionary]] compounds established in Armenian-populated regions, including Van and Kharput. The atrocities were reported regularly in newspapers and literary journals around the world.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |282–5}}

On his return home in 1924 after thirty years as a U.S. Consul in the Near East, and most of the preceding decade as Consul General at Smyrna, [[George Horton]] wrote his own "account of the Systematic Extermination of Christian Populations by Mohammedans and of the Culpability of Certain Great Powers; with a True Story of the Burning of Smyrna" (1926 subtitle, ''The Blight of Asia'').<ref name="Horton">{{cite book | last = Horton | first = George | title = The Blight of Asia, An Account of the Systematic Extermination of Christian Populations by Mohammedans and of the Culpability of Certain Great Powers; with the True Story of the Burning of Smyrna | publisher = Gomidas Institute (Sterndale Classics) | year = 2008 |origyear=1926 | location = London | isbn = 978-1-903656-79-2 |url = http://lccn.loc.gov/26009178}} Foreword by [[James W.

As the orders for deportations and massacres were enacted, many consular officials reported what they were witnessing to Ambassador [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]], who described the massacres as a "campaign of race extermination" in a telegram sent to the [[State Department]] on July 16, 1915. In memoirs that he completed during 1918, Morgenthau wrote, "When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the fact&nbsp;..."<ref name="Morgenthau"/>{{rp|213}} The memoirs and reports vividly described the methods used by Ottoman forces and documented numerous instances of atrocities committed against the Christian minority.<ref>James L. Barton, ''Turkish Atrocities: Statements of American Missionaries on the Destruction of Christian Communities in Ottoman Turkey, 1915–1917''. Gomidas Institute, 1998, ISBN 1-884630-04-9.</ref>

=== Allied forces in the Middle East ===
On the Middle Eastern front, the British military was engaged fighting the Ottoman forces in southern Syria and [[Mesopotamia]]. British diplomat [[Gertrude Bell]] filed the following report after hearing the account from a captured Ottoman soldier:

{{quote |The battalion left Aleppo on 3 February and reached Ras al-Ain in twelve hours&nbsp;... some 12,000 Armenians were concentrated under the guardianship of some hundred [[Kurds]]&nbsp;... These Kurds were called gendarmes, but in reality mere butchers; bands of them were publicly ordered to take parties of Armenians, of both sexes, to various destinations, but had secret instructions to destroy the males, children and old women&nbsp;... One of these gendarmes confessed to killing 100 Armenian men himself&nbsp;... the empty desert cisterns and caves were also filled with corpses&nbsp;...<ref name="Fisk" />{{rp |327}}}}

[[Winston Churchill]] described the massacres as an "administrative holocaust" and noted that "the clearance of the race from Asia Minor was about as complete as such an act, on a scale so great, could well be.&nbsp;... There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was planned and executed for political reasons. The opportunity presented itself for clearing Turkish soil of a Christian race opposed to all Turkish ambitions, cherishing national ambitions that could only be satisfied at the expense of Turkey, and planted geographically between Turkish and Caucasian Moslems".<ref name="Fisk" />{{rp |329}}

==== Arnold Toynbee: ''The Treatment of Armenians'' ====
{{See also|The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire}}
Historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] published the collection of documents ''[[The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire]]'' in 1916. Together with British politician and historian [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|Viscount James Bryce]], he compiled statements from survivors and eyewitnesses from other countries including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland, who similarly attested to the systematic massacre of innocent Armenians by Ottoman government forces.<ref>''The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915–1916: Documents Presented to Viscount Grey of Falloden by Viscount James Bryce and Arnold Toynbee, Uncensored Edition''. Ara Sarafian (ed.) Princeton, New Jersey: Gomidas Institute, 2000. ISBN 0-9535191-5-5.</ref>

The book has since been criticized as British wartime propaganda to build up sentiment against the Central Powers {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}, but Bryce had submitted the work to scholars for verification before its publication. [[University of Oxford]] Regius Professor [[Gilbert Murray]] stated, "...&nbsp;the evidence of these letters and reports will bear any scrutiny and overpower any skepticism. Their genuineness is established beyond question".<ref name="Dadrian" />{{rp |228}} Other professors, including [[H. A. L. Fisher|Herbert Fisher]] of [[Sheffield University]] and former [[American Bar Association]] president [[Moorfield Storey]], came to the same conclusion.<ref name="Dadrian" />{{rp |228–9}}

=== Austrian and German joint mission ===
As allies during the war, the Imperial German mission in the Ottoman Empire included both military and civilian components. Germany had brokered a deal with the [[Sublime Porte]] to commission the building of a railroad called the [[Baghdad Railway]] that would stretch from Berlin to the Middle East. At the beginning of 1915, Germany's diplomatic mission was led by Ambassador [[Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim]] who, upon his death in 1915, was succeeded by Count [[Paul Wolff Metternich]]. Like Morgenthau, von Wangenheim began receiving many disturbing messages from consular officials around the Ottoman Empire that detailed the massacres of Armenians. From the province of [[Adana]], Consul Eugene Buge reported that the CUP chief had sworn to massacre any Armenians who had survived the deportation marches.<ref name="Balakian" />{{rp |186}} In June 1915, von Wangenheim sent a cable to Berlin reporting that Talaat had admitted that the deportations were not "being carried out because of 'military considerations alone'". One month later, he came to the conclusion that there "no longer was doubt that the Porte was trying to exterminate the Armenian race in the Turkish Empire".<ref name="Fromkin" />{{rp |213}}

When Wolff-Metternich succeeded von Wangenheim, he continued to dispatch similar cables: "The Committee [CUP] demands the extirpation of the last remnants of the Armenians and the government must yield&nbsp;... A Committee representative is assigned to each of the provincial administrations&nbsp;... [[Turkification]] means license to expel, to kill or destroy everything that is not Turkish".<ref>''Auswärtiges Amt'', West German Foreign Office Archives, K170, no. 4674, folio 63, in Balakian, ''The Burning Tigris'', p. 186.</ref>

Another notable figure in the German military camp was [[Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter]], who documented various massacres of Armenians. He sent fifteen reports regarding "deportations and mass killings" to the German chancellery. His final report noted that fewer than 100,000 Armenians were left alive in the Ottoman Empire: the rest having been exterminated ({{lang-de |ausgerottet}}).<ref name="Fisk" />{{rp |329–30}} Scheubner-Richter also detailed the methods of the Ottoman government, noting its use of the Special Organization and other bureaucratized instruments of genocide.

According to Bat Ye'or, an Israeli historian, the Germans also witnessed Armenians being burned to death. She writes: "The Germans, allies of the Turks in the First World War ... saw how civil populations were shut up in churches and burned, or gathered en masse in camps, tortured to death, and reduced to ashes".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ye'or|first1=Bat|title=The Dhimmi: Jews and Christians Under Islam|date=1985|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|isbn=161147079X|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rowxYgEACAAJ}}</ref> German officers stationed in eastern Turkey disputed the government's assertion that Armenian revolts had broken out, suggesting that the areas were "quiet until the deportations began".<ref name="Fromkin" />{{rp |212}} Other Germans openly supported the Ottoman policy against the Armenians. As [[Hans Humann]], the German naval attaché in Constantinople said to US Ambassador [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.|Henry Morgenthau]]:

<blockquote>I have lived in Turkey the larger part of my life&nbsp;... and I know the Armenians. I also know that both Armenians and Turks cannot live together in this country. One of these races has got to go. And I don't blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians. I think that they are entirely justified. The weaker nation must succumb. The Armenians desire to dismember Turkey; they are against the Turks and the Germans in this war, and they therefore have no right to exist here.<ref name="Morgenthau"/>{{rp|257}}</blockquote>

In a genocide conference held in 2001, professor Wolfgang Wipperman of the [[Free University of Berlin]] introduced documents evidencing that the German High Command was aware of the mass killings at the time but chose not to interfere or speak out.<ref name="Fisk" />{{rp |331}} In his reports to Berlin in 1917, General [[Hans von Seeckt]] supported the reforming efforts of the Young Turks, writing that "the inner weakness of Turkey in their entirety, call for the history and custom of the new Turkish empire to be written".<ref name="Dabag pages 113-135">Dabag, Mihran "The Decisive Generation: Self-authorization and delegations in deciding a genocide" pages&nbsp;113–135 from ''Genocide: Approaches, Case Studies, And Responses'' edited by Graham Charles Kinloch, Raj P. Mohan, New York: Algora Publishing, 2005 page 121.</ref> Seeckt added that "Only a few moments of the destruction are still mentioned. The upper levels of society had become unwarlike, the main reason being the increasing mixing with foreign elements of a long standing unculture".<ref name="Dabag pages 113-135" /> Seeckt blamed all of the problems of the Ottoman Empire on the Jews and the Armenians, whom he portrayed as a fifth column working for the Allies.<ref name="Dabag pages 113-135" /> In July 1918, Seeckt sent a message to Berlin stating that "It is an impossible state of affairs to be allied with the Turks and to stand up for the Armenians. In my view any consideration, Christian, sentimental, and political should be eclipsed by a hard, but clear necessity for war".<ref name="Dabag pages 113-135" />

One photograph shows two unidentified German army officers, in company of three Turkish soldiers and a Kurdish man, standing amidst human remains. The discovery of this photograph prompted English journalist [[Robert Fisk]] to draw a direct line from the Armenian Genocide to the Holocaust. Fisk, while acknowledging the role playing by most German diplomats and parliamentaries in the condemnation of the Ottoman Turks, noted that some of the German witnesses to the Armenian holocaust would later go on to play a role in the Nazi regime. For example, [[Konstantin Freiherr von Neurath]], who was attached to the Turkish 4th Army in 1915 with instructions to monitor "operations" against the Armenians, later became Hitler's foreign minister and "Protector of Bohemia and Moravia" during [[Reinhard Heydrich]]'s terror in Czechoslovakia.<ref>{{cite news|author=Robert Fisk |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/photograph-links-germans-to-1915-armenia-genocide-8219537.html |title=Photograph links Germans to 1915 Armenia genocide |publisher=The Independent |date=21 October 2012 |location=London}}</ref>

=== Russian military ===
The Russian Empire's response to the bombardment of its Black Sea naval ports was primarily a land campaign through the Caucasus. Early victories against the Ottoman Empire from the winter of 1914 to the spring 1915 saw significant gains of territory, including relieving the Armenian bastion resisting in the city of Van in May 1915. The Russians also reported encountering the bodies of unarmed civilian Armenians as they advanced.<ref>{{cite news|author=Special Cable to THE NEW YORK TIMES. |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9800EEDD1238E633A25750C2A9649C946496D6CF |title=Massacre By Turks in Caucasus Towns; Armenians Led Out into the Streets and Shot or Drowned – Old Friends Not Spared |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=23 February 1915}}</ref> In March 1916, the scenes they saw in the city of [[Erzurum]] led the Russians to retaliate against the Ottoman III Army whom they held responsible for the massacres, destroying it in its entirety.<ref>New York Times Dispatch.

=== Scandinavian missionaries and diplomats ===
Although a neutral state throughout the war, Sweden had permanent representatives in the Ottoman Empire who closely followed and continuously reported on major developments there.  Its embassy in Constantinople was led by Ambassador [[Cossva Anckarsvärd]], with M. Ahlgren as envoy and Captain Einar af Wirsen as military attaché. On 7 July 1915, Ambassador Anckarsvärd dispatched a two-page report concerning the Armenian massacres to [[Stockholm]]. The report began as follows:
 
{{quote |The persecutions of the Armenians have reached hair-raising proportions and all points to the fact that the Young Turks want to seize the opportunity, since due to different reasons there are no effective external pressure to be feared, to once and for all put an end to the Armenian question.

On 9 August 1915, Anckarsvärd dispatched yet another report, confirming his suspicions regarding the plans of the Turkish government, "It is obvious that the Turks are taking the opportunity to, now during the war, annihilate [utplåna] the Armenian nation so that when the peace comes no Armenian question longer exists".<ref name="Avedian" />{{rp |41}}

Reflecting upon the situation in Turkey during the final stages of the war, Envoy Alhgren presented an analysis of the prevailing situation in Turkey and the hard times which had befallen the population. In explaining the increased living costs he identified a number of reasons: "obstacles for domestic trade, the almost total paralysing of the foreign trade and finally the strong decreasing of labour power, caused partly by the mobilisation but partly also by the extermination of the Armenian race [utrotandet af den armeniska rasen]".<ref name="Avedian" />{{rp |52}}

Wirsén, when writing his memoirs from his mission to the Balkans and Turkey, ''Minnen från fred och krig'' ("Memories from Peace and War"), dedicated an entire chapter to the Armenian genocide, entitled ''Mordet på en nation'' ("The Murder of a Nation"). Commenting on the interpretation that the deportations resulted from the purported collaboration of the Armenians with the Russians, Wirsen states that the deportations were nothing but a cover for their extermination: "Officially, these had the goal to move the entire Armenian population to the steppe regions of Northern Mesopotamia and Syria, but in reality they aimed to exterminate [utrota] the Armenians, whereby the pure Turkish element in Asia Minor would achieve a dominating position".<ref name="Avedian" />{{rp |28}} He concluded: "The annihilation of the Armenian nation in Asia Minor must revolt all human feelings&nbsp;... The way the Armenian problem was solved was hair-raising. I can still see in front of me Talaat's cynical expression, when he emphasized that the Armenian question was solved".<ref name="Avedian" />{{rp |29}}

Norwegian missionary nurse [[Bodil Katharine Biørn|Bodil Biørn]] was based in the town of Mezereh (now Elazig) and later in Mush, where she worked for widows and orphaned children in cooperation with other missionaries. She witnessed the massacres in Mush and saw most of the children in her care murdered along with Armenian priests, teachers, and assistants. She escaped after nine days on horseback but stayed on in the region for another two years under increasingly difficult working conditions. After a period at home she again went to Armenia and, until she retired in 1935, worked for Armenian refugees in Syria and Lebanon. Bodil Biørn was also an able photographer. Many of her photos are now in the National Archives of Norway. In combination with her comments, written in her photo albums or on the back of the prints themselves, these photos bear strong witness of the atrocities that she saw.<ref name=NorwegianStateArchive>{{cite journal | publisher = Norwegian State Archive | url = http://www.arkivverket.no/webfelles/armenia/english.html | title = Armenia}}</ref>

Due to the period of weak central government and [[Tehran]]'s inability to protect its territorial integrity, no resistance was offered by the mostly Islamic Persian troops when, after the withdrawal of Russian troops from the extreme northwest of Persia, Islamic Turks invaded the town of [[Salmas]] in northwestern Persia and tortured and massacred the Christian Armenian inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cilicia.com/armo10c-mr191507a.html |title=The Jihad Rampant in Persia by Rev.

== Studies on the Genocide ==
The Armenian Genocide is widely corroborated by international genocide scholars. The [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] (IAGS), consisting of the world's foremost experts on genocide,<ref>{{cite news|title=International Association of Genocide Scholars Officially Recognizes Ottoman Genocides Against the Armenians, Assyrians, and Hellenics|url=http://www.atour.com/~aahgn/news/20080311a.html|date=11 March 2008}}</ref> unanimously passed a formal resolution affirming the fact of the Armenian Genocide. According to IAGS, "Every book on comparative genocide studies in the English language contains a segment on the Armenian Genocide. Leading texts in the international law of genocide such as [[William Schabas]]'s ''Genocide in International Law'' cite the Armenian Genocide as precursor to the Holocaust and as a precedent for the law on crimes against humanity.

Anderson]] surmises, "we have no reason to doubt the remark is genuine, both attack and defense obscure an obvious reality" that the Armenian Genocide has achieved "iconic status... as the apex of horrors imaginable in 1939," and that Hitler used it to persuade the German military that committing genocide excited a great deal of "talk" but no serious consequences for a nation that perpetrates genocide.

=== Origins of the word ''genocide'' ===
{{further|Genocide}}
[[File:The Genocide Word by Raphael Lemkin.ogv|thumb|330px|Lemkin: the origin of the word "genocide", (CBS News)]]

Law professor [[Raphael Lemkin]], who coined the term "genocide" in 1943, has stated that he did so with the fate of the Armenians in mind, explaining that:

<blockquote>...it happened so many times&nbsp;... It happened to the Armenians, then after the Armenians [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] took action.<ref name="auto1">{{cite news |last=Stanley |first=Alessandra |title=A PBS Documentary Makes Its Case for the Armenian Genocide, With or Without a Debate |work=New York Times |date=17 April 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/17/arts/television/17stan.html}}</ref></blockquote>

[[Hebrew University]] scholar [[Yehuda Bauer]] suggests of the Armenian Genocide, "This is the closest parallel to the [[Holocaust]]".<ref name=bauer_holocaust>{{cite book | first = Yehuda | last = Bauer | chapter = The Place of the Holocaust in Contemporary History | title = Holocaust: Religious & Philosophical Implications |isbn= 978-1-55778-212-0|date=1998|editor-first=John K.|editor-last=Roth|editor2-first=Michael|editor2-last=Berenbaum|publisher=Paragon House}}</ref> He nonetheless distinguishes several key differences between the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide, particularly in regard to motivation:

{{quote |[T]he Nazis saw the Jews as ''the'' central problem of world history. Upon its solution depended the future of mankind. Unless International Jewry was defeated, human civilization would not survive. The attitude towards the Jews had in it important elements of pseudo-religion. There was no such motivation present in the Armenian case; Armenians were to be annihilated for power-political reasons, and in Turkey only&nbsp;... The differences between the holocaust and the Armenian massacres are less important than the similarities—and even if the Armenian case is not seen as a holocaust in the extreme form which it took towards Jews, it is certainly the nearest thing to it.<ref name=bauer_holocaust />}}
[[File:Genocide 2011 1.JPG|thumb|Commemoration of the Armenian Genocide in [[Volgograd]], Russia]]
Bauer has also suggested that the Armenian Genocide is best understood, not as having begun in 1915, but rather as "an ongoing genocide, from 1896, through 1908/9, through World War I and right up to 1923".<ref name="ongoing">{{cite journal|last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |url=http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/conference/yahuda_bauer.pdf |format=PDF |title=Can Genocides be Prevented? |publisher=Armenia Foreign Ministry |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080215072953/http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/conference/yahuda_bauer.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2008 }}</ref>

Several international organizations have conducted studies of the atrocities, each in turn determining that the term "genocide" aptly describes "the Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915–16".<ref name="ictj">{{cite web|title=Turkey Recalls Envoys Over Armenian Genocide |publisher=International Center for Transitional Justice |date=8 May 2006 |url=http://www.ictj.org/en/news/coverage/article/935.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080703184136/http://www.ictj.org/en/news/coverage/article/935.html |archivedate=3 July 2008 }}</ref> Among the organizations affirming this conclusion are the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]], the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]], and the United Nations' [[Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities]].<ref name="ictj" /><ref name=armeniapediaictj>{{cite journal | url = http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=International_Center_for_Transitional_Justice | publisher = Armeniapedia | title = International Center for Transitional Justice}}</ref>

This tradition instills a sense of identity in Turkish nationalists—both from the left and the right, and it is passed on from generation to generation through the school system. This tradition also requires an antipole against which it could define itself.

Efforts by the Turkish government and its agents to quash mention of the genocide have resulted in numerous scholarly, diplomatic, political and legal controversies.

In 1973, Turkey recalled its ambassador to France to protest the Genocide monument erected in [[Marseille]]s "to the memory of the 1.5 million Armenian victims of the genocide ordered by the Turkish rulers in 1915".<ref name="Derogy1990">{{cite book|author=Jacques Derogy|title=Resistance and revenge: the Armenian assassination of the Turkish leaders responsible for the 1915 massacres and deportations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpL9QKCJ2L8C&pg=PA196|date=1 July 1990|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-88738-338-0|pages=196–}}</ref>

In 1973, the [[Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities]], a former UN body, mandated special rapporteur Nicodème Ruhashyankiko to produce a report on the issue of genocide. Early drafts of Ruhashyankiko's report referred to the World War I era Ottoman massacre of Armenians as genocide, but that reference disappeared from his final report (1978) under pressure from Turkey.<ref>Thornberry, Patrick.

The [[Israel]]i Foreign Ministry attempted to prevent any mention of the Armenian Genocide at an international conference on genocide held in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1982. Several reports suggested that Turkey had warned that [[Turkish Jews]] might face "reprisals" if the conference permitted Armenian participation.<ref>"[http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/04/world/genocide-parley-with-armenians-to-proceed.html Genocide Parley with Armenians to Proceed]", ''[[New York Times]]'', 4 June 1982.</ref> This charge was "categorically denied" by Turkey;<ref>Howe, Marvine.

In the same year, the [[Institute of Turkish Studies]] in Washington, D.C. (ITS) was established by a $3 million grant from the Turkish Government. Israel Charny identifies the ITS and some of its foremost deniers of the Armenian genocide, such as [[Stanford J. Shaw|Stanford Shaw]], [[Heath W.

A 1989 U.S. Senate proposal to recognize the Armenian Genocide stoked the ire of Turkey. The proposal occurred in the context of the publication of "The Slaughterhouse Province," the eyewitness report by [[Leslie Davis]], American diplomat and consul in Kharpert from 1914-1917, who reported that "thousands and thousands of Armenians, mostly innocent and helpless women and children, were butchered" in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey responded by blocking [[United States Navy]] visits to Turkey and suspending some US military training facilities on Turkish territory.

[[Armenia]] has been involved in a protracted ethnic-territorial conflict with [[Azerbaijan]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] state, since Azerbaijan became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. The conflict has featured several pogroms, massacres, and waves of [[ethnic cleansing]], by both sides. Some foreign policy observers and historians have suggested that Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have sought to portray the modern conflict as a continuation of the Armenian Genocide, in order to influence modern policy-making in the region.<ref name="Bloxham" /><ref name=ambrosio12>Ambrosio, Thomas.

== Reparations to the victims ==
{{Main|Armenian Genocide reparations}}

=== The grounds of the international law ===
The United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law provide in part, that reparation may be claimed individually and where appropriate collectively, by the direct victims of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, the immediate family, dependants or other persons or groups of persons closely connected with the direct victims.<ref name="UNHCR">"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130523165111/http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/b3111e1e8f4a9278c125660f004e5fcf?Opendocument QUESTION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL PERSONS SUBJECTED TO ANY FORM OF DETENTION OR IMPRISONMENT]". United Nations Commission on Human Rights.</ref>
According to Henry Theriault, while current members of Turkish society cannot be blamed morally for the destruction of Armenians, present-day [[Republic of Turkey]], as [[successor state]] to the Ottoman Empire and as beneficiary of the wealth and land expropriations brought forth through the genocide, is responsible for reparations.<ref name="Theriault">{{cite web | last = Theriault | first = Henry | title = The Global Reparations Movement and Meaningful Resolution of the Armenian Genocide | publisher = Armenian Weekly | date = 6 May 2010 | url = http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/05/06/reparations-2/ | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510063921/http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/05/06/reparations-2/| archivedate= 10 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Particularly important are Principles 9 and 12 that state, that civil claims relating to reparations for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law shall not be subject to statutes of limitations (article 9), and that restitution shall be provided to re-establish the situation that existed prior to the violations of human rights or international humanitarian law. The restitution requires, ''inter alia'' – return to one's place of residence and restoration of property.<ref name="UNHCR"/><ref>Commission on Human Rights, fifty-third session, Doc. E/CN.4/1997/104. Compare with the first report by Professor Theo van Boven C/CH.4/Sub.2/1993/8 of 2 July 1993, section IX, and the second report C/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/7 of 24 May 1996</ref>

Professor of International Law of [[Geneva School of Diplomacy]] (J.D. – Harvard, Dr.phil. – Göttingen), former Secretary of the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] and former Chief of Petitions at the Office of the [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], Dr. Alfred de Zayas stated that, because of the continuing character of the crime of genocide in factual and legal terms, the remedy of restitution has not been foreclosed. Thus the survivors of the genocide against the Armenians, both individually and collectively, have standing to advance a claim for restitution. Whenever possible complete restitution or restoration to the previous condition should be granted. But where it is not possible, relevant compensation may be substituted as a remedy.

In an article published in the [[European Journal of International Law]], Vahagn Avedian, leaving aside the limitations of the UN Genocide Convention, emphasizes the applicability of international laws that prevailed at the time and remain in force up to the present, e.g. the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], more specifically the [[Martens Clause]], pertaining to the protection of civilian population, but also existing international laws on unlawful confiscation, etc. Thus, the actions of the Turkish governments (the Ottoman, the insurgent nationalist movement as well as the succeeding republic), should be viewed from the perspective of Internationally Wrongful Acts. Avedian argues that: {{quote | the Republic not only failed to stop doing the wrongful acts of its predecessor, but it also continued the very internationally wrongful acts committed by the Young Turk government. Thus, the insurgent National Movement, which later became the Republic, made itself responsible for not only its own wrongful acts but also those of its predecessor, including the act of genocide committed in 1915–1916.<ref>{{cite journal | journal = European Journal of International Law | first=Vahagn | last=Avedian | format = PDF | url =http://ejil.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/3/797.full.pdf?keytype=ref&ijkey=4FZRuLROIocgqw8 |title = State Identity, Continuity, and Responsibility: The Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Turkey and the Armenian Genocide | year = 2012 | volume = 23 | issue=3 | pages = 797–820 | doi = 10.1093/ejil/chs056}}</ref>}}

=== Sèvres Treaty ===
Although there are different opinions on the legitimacy of the Treaty of Sèvres and its relativity to reparation claims, there are specialists who claim that some of its elements retain the force of law.<ref>{{cite book|last=Toriguian|first=Shavarsh|title=The Armenian question and international law|year=1988|publisher=ULV Press|location=La Verne, Calif., U.S.A.|isbn=0-911707-13-1|pages=45–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=Ff9dU73UA9e78gXj0YHIAQ|edition=2nd}}</ref> In particular, the fixing of the proper borders of an Armenian state was undertaken pursuant to the treaty and determined by a binding arbitral award, regardless of whether the treaty was ultimately ratified.

=== Lawsuits ===
In July 2004, after the [[California State Legislature]] passed the [[Armenian Genocide Insurance Act]], descendants of Armenian Genocide victims settled a case for about 2,400 life insurance policies from [[New York Life]] written on Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="Reparations">{{cite book | last = Brophy | first = Alfred L. | title = Reparations: Pro & Con | publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 2006 | location = New York | pages = 119–120 | isbn=0-19-530408-X}}</ref> Around 1918, the Turkish government attempted to recover payments for the people it had killed, with the argument that there were no identifiable heirs to the policy holders.

[[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1988 novel ''[[Bluebeard (book)|Bluebeard]]'' features the Armenian Genocide as an underlying theme. Other novels incorporating the Armenian Genocide include [[Louis de Berniéres]]' ''Birds without Wings'', [[Edgar Hilsenrath]]'s German-language ''[[The Story of the Last Thought]]'', and Polish [[Stefan Żeromski]]'s 1925 ''[[The Spring to Come]]''. A story in Edward Saint-Ivan's 2006 anthology "The Black Knight's God" includes a fictional survivor of the Armenian Genocide.

The first film about the Armenian Genocide appeared in 1919, a Hollywood production titled ''[[Ravished Armenia]]''. It was produced by the [[American Committee for Armenian and Syrian Relief]] and was based on the narrative account of survivor [[Aurora Mardiganian]], who played herself. It resonated with acclaimed director [[Atom Egoyan]], influencing his 2002 ''[[Ararat (film)|Ararat]]''. There are also references in [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[America, America]]'' and [[Henri Verneuil]]'s ''[[Mayrig]]''. At the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] of 2007 Italian directors [[Paolo and Vittorio Taviani]] presented another film about the atrocities, based on Antonia Arslan's book, ''[[La Masseria Delle Allodole]]'' (''The Farm of the Larks'').<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/armenian-genocide-at-the-berlin-film-festival-the-lark-farm-wakens-turkish-ghosts-a-466427.html |title = Armenian Genocide at the Berlin Film Festival: "The Lark Farm" Wakens Turkish Ghosts | author = Wolfgang Höbel and Alexander Smoltczyk |publisher = Spiegel Online}}</ref> Richard Kalinoski's play, ''Beast on the Moon'', is about two Armenian Genocide survivors.

The paintings of Armenian-American [[Arshile Gorky]], a seminal figure of [[Abstract Expressionism]], are considered to have been influenced by the suffering and loss of the period.<ref>{{cite book|last=Herrera|first=Hayden|title=Arshile Gorky: His Life and Work|year=2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=1-4668-1708-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbNino3vXMEC}}</ref> In 1915, at age 10, Gorky fled his native [[Van, Turkey|Van]] and escaped to Russian-Armenia with his mother and three sisters, only to have his mother die of starvation in Yerevan in 1919. His two ''The Artist and His Mother'' paintings are based on a photograph with his mother taken in Van.

In 1975, famous French-Armenian singer [[Charles Aznavour]] recorded the song "[[Ils Sont Tombés (Charles Aznavour Song)|Ils sont tombés]]" ("They Fell"), dedicated to the memory of Armenian Genocide victims.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.azad-hye.net/article/article_view.asp?rec=84 |title = The status of Armenian communities living in the United States |author = Mari Terzian |publisher = Azad-Hye | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070928093603/http://www.azad-hye.net/article/article_view.asp?rec=84| archivedate= 28 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The American band [[System of a Down]], composed of four descendants of Armenian Genocide survivors, has promoted awareness of the Armenian Genocide through its lyrics, including [[P.L.U.C.K.]] and in concerts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abrahamian |first=Line |title=Talking With Turks and Armenians About the Genocide |url=http://readersdigest.ca/mag/2006/10/genocide.php |newspaper=[[Reader's Digest]] Canada |date=14 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20061005090545/http://readersdigest.ca:80/mag/2006/10/genocide.php |archivedate=5 October 2006 }}</ref>

In late 2003, [[Diamanda Galás]] released the album ''Defixiones, Will and Testament: Orders from the Dead'', an 80-minute memorial tribute to the Armenian, Assyrian and Greek victims of the genocide in Turkey. "The performance is an angry meditation on genocide and the politically cooperative denial of it, in particular the Turkish and American denial of the Armenian, Assyrian, and Anatolian Greek genocides from 1914 to 1923".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.diamandagalas.com/defixiones/ | title = Defixiones: Orders from the Dead | first = Diamanda | last = Galás | publisher = The San Francisco Chronicle | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011191127/http://diamandagalas.com/defixiones/| archivedate= 11 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 2008, Armenian-American composer [[Andrey Kasparov]] premiered ''Tsitsernakabert'', an original work for modern dance and six musicians: alto flute, bass/ contrabass flute, violin, two percussionists, and mezzo-soprano.<ref>{{cite web|author=Old Dominion University |url=http://ww2.odu.edu/apps/calendar/index.php?todo=details&id=9417 |title=Old Dominion University Calendar &#124; Diehn CREO Concert: The Synergy of Dance, Art and Music |publisher=Ww2.odu.edu |date=18 March 2008}}</ref> The work opens with eight dancers posed in a circle – inclined toward the circle's centre – in a tableau reminiscent of the [[Tsitsernakaberd|eponymous memorial]] to victims of the Armenian Genocide, situated in [[Yerevan]], capital of [[Armenia]].<ref>Rutherford, Laine M.

[[Julian Cope]]'s 2013 album ''[[Revolutionary Suicide (album)|Revolutionary Suicide]]'' includes a song over 15 minutes long, "The Armenian Genocide", memorializing the event.

The 2014 drama film ''[[The Cut (2014 film)|The Cut]]'' is based on the Armenian Genocide.

Argentine composer [[Juan María Solare]] wrote a lyrical [[monodrama]] titled ''Verchin Oror'' (Last Lullaby), with text by [[Ruben Sevak]] (1885-1915), one of the poets arrested on 24 April 1915. This work (symbolically finished on 24 April 2015) was a commission of the Foundation Encuentros Internacionales de Música Contemporánea (Argentina). The piece is scored for mezzosoprano and instrumental quintet (flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano).

On 13 April 2015, [[1915 The Movie]] held its Hollywood premiere at the [[Egyptian Theater]] in Los Angeles. The film was screened across the world, including Canada, Russia, and Armenia. Directed by [[Garin Hovannisian]] and Alec Mouhibian, the film tells the story of a mysterious director (played by [[Simon Abkarian]]), who stages a play and intends to bring the ghosts of the Armenian Genocide back.
