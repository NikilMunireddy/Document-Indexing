'''Darmstadt''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdaʁmʃtat|-|De-Darmstadt.ogg}}) is a city in the [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Hesse]] in [[Germany]], located in the southern part of the [[Frankfurt Rhine Main Area|Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt Metropolitan Region)]]. Darmstadt has a population around 150,000 (2013).<ref>Hessisches Landesamt für Statistik (State of Hessen): Bevölkerung der hessischen Gemeinden [http://www.statistik-hessen.de/themenauswahl/bevoelkerung-gebiet/regionaldaten/bevoelkerung-der-hessischen-gemeinden/index.html] Retrieved 14 October 2014</ref> The Darmstadt [[Larger Urban Zone]] has 430,993 inhabitants.<ref>European Union, City Audits: http://www.urbanaudit.org/CityProfiles.aspx?CityCode=DE025C&CountryCode=DE</ref>

Darmstadt holds the official title "City of Science" ({{lang-de|Wissenschaftsstadt}}) as it is a major centre of scientific institutions, universities, and high-technology companies. The [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC) is located in Darmstadt, as well as [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung|GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research]], where several chemical elements such as [[bohrium]] (1981), [[meitnerium]] (1982), [[hassium]] (1984), [[darmstadtium]] (1994), [[roentgenium]] (1994),  and [[copernicium]] (1996) were discovered.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wanted: Suitable name for unstable, heavyweight element |publisher=The Guardian|year=2009|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2009/jun/11/element-112-name-periodic-table|accessdate=22 December 2014}}</ref> The existence of the following elements were also confirmed at  [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung|GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research]]: [[Ununtrium]] (2012), [[Flerovium]] (2009), [[Ununpentium]] (2012), [[Livermorium]] (2010), [[Ununseptium]] (2012),  and [[Ununoctium]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Discovery of new elements |publisher=GSI Darmstadt|year=2016|url=https://www.gsi.de/en/researchaccelerators/research_an_overview/neue_elemente.htm}}</ref> Darmstadt is also the seat of the world's oldest pharmaceutical company, [[Merck Group|Merck]], which is the city's largest employer.

Darmstadt was formerly the capital of a sovereign country, the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]] and its successor, the [[People's State of Hesse]], a federal state of Germany. As the capital of an increasingly prosperous [[duchy]], the city gained some international prominence and remains one of the wealthiest cities in Europe.<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/jan/30/socialsciences.research City of London richest area in Europe], ''The Guardian'',  30 January 2002</ref> In the 20th century, industry (especially chemicals), as well as large science and electronics (later information technology) sectors became increasingly important, and are still a major part of the city's economy.

=== Origins ===
The name Darmstadt first appears towards the end of the 11th century, then as ''Darmundestat''. Literally translated, ''Darmstadt'' means "Gut City", but this is just a coincidence. Pronounced in the local dialect, the city is called "Dammstad" which means "Embankment City" in English, however, this is also without any relevance. The origins of the name are unknown.<ref name="DARM"/> 'Dar-mund' in Middle Low German is translated as "Boggy Headlands", but it could be a misspelling in local dialect of another name. Even locals often believe, incorrectly, that the name derives from the 'Darmbach' (a small stream formerly running through the city). In fact, the stream received its current name much later, after the city, not vice versa.<ref name="DARM">"[http://www.darmbach.de/Projekt/documents/Wokommterherwowillerhin.pdf Wo kommt er her, wo will er hin?]" – ''Darmstädter Echo'', 2007-12-03, in German. Retrieved 28 July 2015.</ref>

Darmstadt was chartered as a city by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Ludwig the Bavarian]] in 1330, at which time it belonged to the counts of [[County of Katzenelnbogen|Katzenelnbogen]].<ref name="FACTS">{{cite web | url=http://www.darmstadt.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/wirtschaft/4.pdf | title = Essential Facts (brochure from the official city website)| format=PDF | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090319082609/http://www.darmstadt.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/wirtschaft/4.pdf | archivedate=2009-03-19 | year=2005}}</ref> The city, then called ''Darmstait'', became a secondary residence for the counts, with a small castle established at the site of the current, much larger edifice.

When the house of Katzenelnbogen became extinct in 1479, the city was passed to the [[Landgraviate of Hesse]], and was seat of the ruling [[Landgraf|landgraves]] (1567–1806) and thereafter (to 1918) of the grand dukes of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]].<ref name="HISTKatz2">[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.de/geschichtedemandt.html Die Geschichte des Grafenhauses ] (from the 'Graf v.

In the beginning of the 20th century, Darmstadt was an important centre for the art movement of [[Jugendstil]], the German variant of [[Art Nouveau]]. Annual architectural competitions led to the building of many architectural treasures of this period.  Also during this period, in 1912 the chemist [[Anton Kollisch]], working for the pharmaceutical company [[Merck KGaA|Merck]], first synthesised the chemical [[MDMA]] (ecstasy) in Darmstadt. Darmstadt's municipal area was extended in 1937 to include the neighbouring localities of Arheilgen and Eberstadt, and in 1938 the city was separated administratively from the surrounding district (''Kreis'').

=== Nazi Germany ===
Darmstadt was the first city in Germany to force Jewish shops to close in early 1933, shortly after the Nazis took power in Germany. The shops were only closed for one day, for "endangering communal order and tranquility".<ref>''[http://chareidi.shemayisrael.com/archives5761/lechlecha/features.htm Beginning of the End]'' – Musman, Moshe; from ''Borne Aloft On The Wings Of A Dove'' (in-depth feature on [[Dei'ah veDibur]] website)</ref> In 1942, over 3,000 Jews from Darmstadt were first forced into a collection camp located in the Liebigschule, and later deported to [[concentration camp]]s<ref name="HIST">[http://www.darmstadt.de/kultur/geschichte/02648/ Darmstädter Stadtgeschichte 20. Jahrhundert] (from the official city website, in German, less detailed also in English)</ref> where most eventually died.

Several prominent members of the German resistance movement against the Nazis were citizens of Darmstadt, including [[Wilhelm Leuschner]] and [[Theodor Haubach]], both executed for their opposition to Hitler's regime.

Darmstadt was first bombed on 30 July 1940, and 34 other air raids would follow before the war's end. The old city centre was largely destroyed in a [[Bombing of Darmstadt in World War II|British bombing raid]] on 11 September 1944. This attack was an early use of the ''firestorm'' technique, which was subsequently used against the historic city of [[Dresden]] in February 1945. To create a firestorm, a number of incendiary bombs are dropped around the city before the explosive blast bombs are dropped, thus beginning a self-sustaining combustion process in which winds generated by the fire ensure it continues to burn until everything possible has been consumed. Darmstadt was selected as the secondary target for the raid, but was promoted to the primary target after clouds were observed over the primary which would have hindered any reconnaissance of the after-effects. During this fire attack an estimated 11,000 to 12,500 of the inhabitants burned to death, and 66,000 to 70,000 were left homeless.<ref name="HIST"/> Over three quarters of Darmstadt's inner city was destroyed.<ref>[http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/city/hist.html Darmstadt history] (from the website of the [[Technical University of Darmstadt]])</ref> Post-war rebuilding was done in a relatively plain architectural style, although a number of the historic buildings were rebuilt to their original appearance following the city's capture on 20 March 1945 by American [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]].

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Darmstadt became home to many technology companies and research institutes, and has been promoting itself as a "city of science" since 1997. It is well known as a high-tech centre in the vicinity of [[Frankfurt International Airport|Frankfurt Airport]], with important activities in spacecraft operations (the [[European Space Operations Centre]], [[European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites]]), chemistry, pharmacy, information technology, biotechnology, telecommunications (substantial [[Deutsche Telekom]] presence) and mechatronics. In 2000, its region also scored Rank 3 amongst 97 German regions in the ''[[WirtschaftsWoche]]'' test ranking Germany's high-tech regions.<ref name="FACTS"/>

The [[Darmstadt University of Technology|TU Darmstadt]] is one of the important technical institutes in Germany and is well known for its research and teaching in the Electrical, Mechanical and Civil Engineering disciplines. Together with other tertiary institutions, the TU is responsible for the large student population of the city, which stood at 33,547 in 2004.<ref name="FACTS"/>

=== Castles and historical buildings ===
[[File:Residenzschloss Darmstadt 539-Gdh.JPG|thumb|254px|Ducal Palace and Market Square]]<!-- this image is forced to imagebox width -->
Darmstadt was the [[Capital city|capital]] of an independent country (the [[Grand Duchy of Hesse]]) until 1871 and the capital of the German state of [[Hesse]] until 1945. It is due to its past as a capital city that it has many architectural testimonies of this period. Many of its major architectural landmarks were created by [[Georg Moller]] who was appointed the court master builder of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Due to the fact that the last ruling Grand Duke of Hesse, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse|Ernst Ludwig]] was a grandson of [[Queen Victoria]] and brother to [[Alexandra of Hesse|Empress Alexandra]] of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] the architecture of Darmstadt has been influenced by British and Russian imperial architecture with many examples still existing, such as the Luisenplatz with its ducal column, the old Hessian State Theatre (at Karolinenplatz) and the Russian Chapel by [[Leon Benois]]. The Russian church, St. Mary Magdalene Chapel, is named in honor of the patron saint of Tzar Nicholas' mother and was built of Russian stone on Russian soil brought to Darmstadt by train. It was used by the Russian royal family and court during regular visits to the Tsarina's ducal brother and family in Darmstadt.<ref>[http://www.russianorthodoxchurch.ws/synod/engdocuments/enart_churches.html]</ref> The ducal palace of Darmstadt is located in the city centre. It was the residence of the counts of [[County of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]], later as [[Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine|Grand Dukes of Hesse]] by the grace of Napoleon. The rulers of Hesse also owned a hunting lodge in [[Kranichstein]] which is a nowadays used as a five star hotel. The most famous castle in the Darmstadt region is [[Frankenstein Castle]] due to claims that the real castle may have had an influence on Mary Shelley's decision to choose the name [[Frankenstein]] for her monster-creating scientist. This castle dates back to the 13th century, but it was acquired by the counts of Hesse-Darmstadt in 1662.

=== Modern architecture ===
[[File:Darmstadt-Waldspirale-Hundertwasser3.jpg|thumb|left|254px|The Waldspirale]]
Darmstadt has a rich tradition in modern architecture. After 1945 several ''"Meisterbauten"'' (''Masterful Architectonic Creations'') were built that set standards for modern architecture. These buildings still exist and are used for various public and private purposes. In the late 1990s the [[Waldspirale]] ('Forest Spiral') was built, a residential complex by Austrian [[Hundertwasser|Friedensreich Hundertwasser]]. As an almost [[Surrealism|surreal]] building, it is internationally famous for its almost absolute rejection of rectangular forms, down to every window having a different shape, the style being a trademark of Hundertwasser's work. Hundertwasser died before the Waldspirale was finished.

=== Art Nouveau ===
Darmstadt was a centre of the [[Art Nouveau|Art Nouveau movement]]. Surviving examples of the [[Jugendstil]] period include the Rosenhöhe, a landscaped English-style rose garden from the 19th century, recently renovated and replanted,<ref>[http://www.darmstadt.de/en/sights/rosenhoehe/index.html Rosenhöhe – planted with roses] (from the official city website)</ref> the [[Mathildenhöhe]],<ref>[http://www.darmstadt.de/en/sights/mathildenhoehe/index.html Mathildenhöhe (Artists' Colony)] (from the official city website)</ref> with the ''Hochzeitsturm'' ('Wedding tower', also commonly known as the 'Five-Finger-Tower') by [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]], the [[Russian Chapel in Darmstadt]] and large exhibition halls as well as many private villas built by Jugendstil architects who had settled in Darmstadt. German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, Jugendstil. The name is taken from the artistic journal, Die Jugend, which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by Georg Hirth (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: Jugendstil ("young style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts, especially the forms of organic typography and graphic design found in and influenced by German magazines like Jugend, Pan, and Simplicissimus, it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the Netherlands, the Baltic states, and Nordic countries. The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were Munich and Darmstadt.

=== Squares ===
The ''Luisenplatz'', the central square of the city, forms the centre of the city and is the main public transport hub. In 1844 the ''Ludwigsäule'' (called ''Langer Lui'', meaning ''Long Ludwig''), a 33-metre column commemorating [[Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine|Ludwig I]], first Grand Duke of [[Grand Duchy of Hesse|Hesse]], was placed in the middle of the square. While the column still stands, the square is today surrounded by mostly modern buildings. Other important squares are the ''Marktplatz'' (see image) near the old city hall and the ''Sabaisplatz'' at the ''Mathildenhöhe''.

=== Parks ===
[[File:Darmstadt Eingang Rosenhöhe.jpg|thumb|254px|Park Rosenhöhe]]<!-- this image is forced to imagebox width -->
The city has a high density of parks. Among the most important parks are the English style ''Herrngarten'' in central Darmstadt. In former times it was part of the Royal Gardens used exclusively by the duches of Darmstadt. Today it is a public park, heavily used in every season of the year. Other important parks are the French style parks ''Prinz-Georgs-Garten'' and ''Orangerie'', the modern style ''Bürgerpark'' ("People's Park") in northern Darmstadt and the mystical ''Park Rosenhöhe'' ("Rose Heights") which also serves as the cemetery for the [[Duchy|Duches of Darmstadt]] with two impressive mausoleum buildings in its remote parts. The [[Botanischer Garten der TU Darmstadt|Botanischer Garten]] in eastern Darmstadt is a botanical garden maintained by the Darmstadt University of Technology with a fine collection of rare plants and trees.

=== Churches ===
[[File:Russian Chapel in Darmstadt, Germany.jpg|thumb|left|254px|Russian Chapel Darmstadt]]<!-- this image is forced to imagebox width -->
The [[Protestant]] [[Evangelical Church in Germany|''Stadtkirche'' church]],<ref>[[:de:Stadtkirche (Darmstadt)|German wikipedia Protestant ''Stadtkirche'' church]]</ref> built in 1369, is in the pedestrian zone of the downtown city center, next to the historic Hotel Bockshaut.<ref>[http://www.bockshaut.de/EN/ Historic hotel Bockshaut]</ref> The church has [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] elements along with [[renaissance]] and [[baroque]], it houses the [[Royal family|royal]] [[crypt]]. Hotel Bockshaut was built in 1580 for a church presbytery. The most important [[Catholic]] Church is ''St. Ludwig'' in central Darmstadt. The [[Russian Chapel in Darmstadt]] is a [[Russian orthodox church]] which is still in use. It was built and used as a private chapel by the last [[Tsar]] of Russia, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], whose wife [[Alexandra Fyodorovna of Hesse|Alexandra]] was born in Darmstadt. Although Russian orthodox churches also exist in other cities outside Russia, the Russian Chapel in Darmstadt was the only official Russian church used by the Russian Tsar outside the [[Russian Empire]]. It is said that the chapel was built on Russian soil that was brought to Darmstadt exclusively for the purpose of building the Tsar's private chapel on it.

=== Festivals ===
Every year around early July the [[Heinerfest]] festival is held in the streets surrounding the old ducal palace. It is a traditional German festival with music acts, [[beer hall]]s, [[amusement ride]]s and booths selling trinkets and food. The similar 'Schloßgrabenfest', which is more [[live music]]-oriented, is held in the same location every year in May.
These two festivals attract 700,000<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080126230241/http://www.darmstadt.de/infos/heinerfest/ Information about the Heinerfest] (in German)</ref> and 400,000<ref>[http://www.schlossgrabenfest.de/2006/sgf_aktuelles_14.html Schloßgrabenfest 2006] (in German)</ref> visitors respectively.

== Culture ==
[[File:Darmstadt Staatstheater Zuschauerraum vom Rang.jpg|thumb|right|254px|State Theater Darmstadt - Grand Hall]]<!-- this image is forced to imagebox width -->
Darmstadt has a rich cultural heritage. The [[Staatstheater Darmstadt]] (''State Theatre Darmstadt'') dates back to the year 1711. The present building has been in use since 1972 and has three halls which can be used independently.

Darmstadt is located in the [[Upper Rhine Plain]] (German: Oberrheinische Tiefebene), a major rift, about 350&nbsp;km long and on average 50&nbsp;km wide, between the cities of Frankfurt in the north and Basel in the south. Darmstadt's southeastern boroughs are located in the spurs of the [[Odenwald]], a low mountain range in Southern Hesse between the Main and Neckar rivers.

===Climate===
Southern Hesse is well known for its mild climate which allows [[winegrowing]] on a large scale in the region south of Darmstadt. The weather is often volatile with the summers being warm and humid with frequent thunderstorms, the winters mostly relatively mild with frequent periods of [[high fog]]. Snowfall is most likely in January and February, but mild winters without considerable snowfall can occur.

* '''[[Technical University of Darmstadt]]''' (German: ''Technische Universität Darmstadt''), commonly referred to as TU Darmstadt, is a prestigious research university in Germany. It was founded in 1877 and received the right to award doctorates in 1899. In 1882 it was the first university in the world to set up a chair in electrical engineering, in 1883 the first faculty for electrical engineering was founded there. The University is organized in 13 departments and 5 fields of study, which all together offer about 100 courses of studies. The fields of study offer interdisciplinary degree courses in which students take lectures in multiple departments. The University, as its title suggests, offers degree courses in the fields of electrical, mechanical and civil engineering, architecture, computer science, mathematics and the natural sciences. It also offers courses in economics, law, history, politics, sociology, psychology, sport science and linguistics. It also offers degree courses for teaching positions at German vocational schools and Gymnasiums.

* The '''[[Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences]]''' (German: ''Hochschule Darmstadt'') is internationally known for its achievements in the areas of engineering and computer science. The University has the highest number of industrial linkage programs, compared to the rest of the universities of applied sciences. The roots of University of Applied Sciences Darmstadt dates back to 1876. However, it has not emerged as a separate institution before 1971. Today it is the largest University of Applied Sciences in the State of Hesse with about 11,000 students offering courses in architecture, chemical engineering, civil engineering, computer science, design, economics electrical engineering and information technology, mathematics and science, mechanical engineering, media (including information science and engineering), plastics engineering, social and cultural studies, social sciences and sechatronics.

===Technology===
[[File:Views in the Main Control Room (12052189474).jpg|right|thumb|The [[European Space Operations Centre|ESOC]] European Space Operations Command in Darmstadt.]]

Darmstadt is home to many research institutions such as the [[Fraunhofer Society]] (Fraunhofer IGD, Fraunhofer LBF, Fraunhofer SIT) and the [[Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI, "Society for [[heavy ion|Heavy Ion]] Research"), which operates a [[particle accelerator]] in northern Darmstadt. The GSI, amongst other elements, discovered the [[chemical element]] [[darmstadtium]] ([[atomic number]]: 110), named after the city in 2003. This makes Darmstadt one of only eight settlements with elements named after them (the others being [[Ytterby]] in Sweden (four elements); [[Stockholm]] in Sweden ([[holmium]]); [[Strontian]] in Scotland; [[Copenhagen]] in Denmark (whose Latin name gives [[hafnium]]); Paris (whose Latin name gives [[lutetium]]); [[Berkeley, California]]; and [[Dubna]] in Russia). Various other elements, including [[meitnerium]] (atomic number: 109) (1982), [[hassium]] (atomic number: 108) (1984), [[roentgenium]] (atomic number: 111) (1994) and [[copernicium]] (atomic number: 112) (1996) were also synthesized in the Darmstadt facility.

The [[European Space Operations Centre]] (ESOC) of the [[European Space Agency]] is located in Darmstadt. From here, various deep-space exploration spacecraft and Earth-orbiting satellites are operated for the purposes of scientific research, and technology development and demonstration.

[[EUMETSAT]], the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, operates the principal European [[meteorological]] [[satellite]]s from its headquarters, including the first and second generations of [[Meteosat]] geostationary satellites, and the polar-orbiting [[Metop]] series.

Darmstadt is a centre for the pharmaceutical and chemical industry, with Merck, Röhm and [[Carl Schenck|Schenck RoTec]] (part of The Dürr Group) having their main plants and centres here.

===United States military presence===
U.S. forces entered the city of Darmstadt on 25 March 1945. At the end of World War II, Darmstadt was among the 112 communities where U.S. Forces were stationed. Early units stationed here included elements of the U.S. Constabulary, Air Force units and a Quartermaster School.

Over the years, the U.S. military community Darmstadt — under a variety of designations — served as home for thousands of American soldiers and their families. It included six principal installations in Darmstadt and nearby [[Babenhausen]], [[Griesheim (Hesse)|
Griesheim]] and [[Münster]], plus several housing areas, an airfield and a large number of smaller facilities as far away as [[Bensheim]] and [[Aschaffenburg]]. The military newspaper European ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'' also had its headquarters there. As of 1993, the Darmstadt military community also assumed responsibility for the remaining U.S. Army facilities in the [[Frankfurt-am-Main|Frankfurt]] area.

As part of the U.S. Army's ongoing transformation in Germany, the Darmstadt military community, by then designated [[U.S. Army Garrison Darmstadt]], inactivated on 30 September 2008. Even after the garrison inactivation, however, there is still one unit active in Darmstadt: The [[66th Military Intelligence Brigade (United States)|66th Military Intelligence Group]] at the Dagger Complex on Eberstädter Weg,.<ref>{{coord|49.843786|8.584211}}</ref> It draws its support from the nearby [http://www.wiesbaden.army.mil/ U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden]. The website of the 66th Military Intelligence Brigade claims they moved out in 2008, but Google Maps and Bing satellite imagery still show a respectively full and quarter-full parking lot, and the U.S. Army Garrison Wiesbaden's website mentions the unit still being active in Darmstadt, and a Marine Corps company being stationed there as well. With the exception of Dagger Complex, all remaining US installations are now empty and closed to the public, pending property disposal by the German authorities.
