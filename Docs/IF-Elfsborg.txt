'''Idrottsföreningen Elfsborg''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈɛlfsbɔrj}}), also known as '''IF Elfsborg''',  is a professional [[football club]] based in [[Borås]], Sweden, and is affiliated to the [[Västergötlands Fotbollförbund]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://svenskfotboll.se/svensk-fotboll/om-svff/distrikten/?ffid=21 |title= Kontaktuppgifter och tävlingar&nbsp;– Västergötlands Fotbollförbund&nbsp;– Svenskfotboll.se |format= |work= |accessdate=2011-01-13}}</ref> They play in the [[Allsvenskan]] and have spent most of their history in the top tier of [[Swedish football]].

The club was founded in 1904 by a group of 19<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elfsborg.se/nyheter/oevrigt/91/2758|title= 108 års firande till minne av grundarna av Elfsborg|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref> youngsters which all were 14–15 years old. ''Borås Fotbollslag''<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.d7kf.se/2SaRaPrk.htm |title= Borås Fotbollslag blir IF Elfsborg 1904 |work= |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref> was formed in Ordenshuset at [[Landala]] (today [[Knalleland]]) on 26 June 1904. The main protagonist in the formation, Carl Larson, who in addition to football also  practiced [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]] and [[wrestling]]. Claimed the reason was that the main sports club in the city, Borås Athletic and Sports Society, would not exert football in their program.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.svenskafans.com/fotboll/18728.aspx|title= 100 års firande|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref>

The name is derived from [[Älvsborg County]] where instead of making use of the modern spelling Älvsborg, they used out of the older spelling with an ''E''. The same goes for the club colours, reflected in their crest and kit, [[yellow]] and [[black]]. Colors that are taken from [[Älvsborgs regemente]], Elfsborg would not only represent a city but a whole region. A recurring motto of the club is ''"Vi Tillsammans''" (We together).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guliganerna.se/v5/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EL-bladet-Nummer-1-2012.pdf|title= Början av Elfsborgs historia|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.dagensmedia.se/nyheter/kampanjer/article128857.ece|title= Vi Tillsammans mer än fotboll&nbsp;– ett socialt projekt|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref>

Borås Fotbollslag was formed on 26 June 1904, by a group of youngsters. In 1906 the name was changed to IF Elfsborg, because the founders felt there were too many teams with 'Borås' in their name. In 1926 Elfsborg won [[1925-26 in Swedish football#Division 2 V.C3.A4stsvenska Serien 1925.E2.80.9326|Västsvenska Serien]], and defeated [[Halmstad BK]] in the play off, and was promoted to [[Allsvenskan]] for the first time. During the 1930s Elfsborg managed to build a very strong team led by striker [[Sven Jonasson]], who appeared in both the [[1934 FIFA World Cup|1934]] and [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938]] World Cup. In [[Allsvenskan 1935-36|1936]] Elfsborg won Allsvenskan for the first time, and two more titles followed soon after ([[Allsvenskan 1938-39|1939]] and [[Allsvenskan 1939-40|1940]]). During this period Elfsborg had as many as seven players in the [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national team]].

In 1941 Elfsborg left [[Ramnavallen]] to play their home games at the newly constructed [[Ryavallen]]. The first game at the new ground was supposed to be a friendly between [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and [[Finland national football team|Finland]], but Finland's involvement in the Second World War prevented them from playing, so they were replaced by Elfsborg, who beat the Swedish national team 2–1.

In the mid-1940s Elfsborg came close to winning Allsvenskan again, but finished second three years in a row. By the late 1940s Elfsborg's glory days were over, and the club was eventually relegated in 1954.

In 1960 Elfsborg won promotion after an impressive season with 20 wins in 22 games, and the club managed to win Allsvenskan for the fourth time in [[Allsvenskan 1961|1961]], becoming the first Swedish team to go straight from the second level to becoming champions. This was under the leadership of the legendary Sven Andreasson as chairman.

In [[Allsvenskan 1977|1977]] Elfsborg reached second place, but the following years proved difficult for the club. In [[Allsvenskan 1987|1987]] Elfsborg finished last in Allsvenskan, and did not return to the top flight until [[Allsvenskan 1997|1997]]. The team that won promotion contained several future Swedish internationals including [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders Svensson]] and [[Tobias Linderoth]]. Even though Elfsborg won their first two cup titles (in 2001 and 2003), the club struggled to stay in Allsvenskan in the following years.
[[File:Elfsborg 1961.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Elfsborg squad who won the [[List of Swedish football champions|national championship]] 1961.]]
In 2005 Elfsborg spent a lot of money on building Borås Arena, and bringing back former players. The investments paid off and the fifth Championship was won in [[Allsvenskan 2006|2006]]&nbsp;– the club's first Allsvenskan title for 41 years. The year after Elfsborg appeared in the [[UEFA Champions League 2007–08|Champions League qualifying stage]] for the first time, and subsequently reached the group stage in the [[UEFA Cup 2009–10|UEFA Cup]] for the first time. On the way there they knocked out [[Linfield FC]] (Northern Ireland) and [[Debreceni VSC]] (Hungary) in the qualification stage of the Champions League before eventually being eliminated themselves by the hands of [[Valencia CF]] (Spain) in the last round. The club won the last round of qualifications for the Uefa Cup against [[FC Dinamo Bucureşti]] (Romania).

In the group stage IF Elfsborg faced [[AC Fiorentina]] and [[Villarreal]] away and [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[FK Mladá Boleslav]] at Borås Arena and was knocked out.

In the following years, IF Elfsborg under the guidance of coach Magnus Haglund and his 4-2-3-1-formation have established themselves as a top club in Swedish football. The clearly stated ambition to finish top 4, qualifying for European football every year. In 2007, the club finished 4th securing a place in the last edition of the Intertoto-cup, from which they advanced but was surprisingly knocked out by [[St Patrick's Athletic F.C.]] in the second qualifying round of the [[UEFA Cup]] after conceding late goals in both legs.

The team bounced back though, competing for the title again until the very last round of [[Allsvenskan 2008|2008]]. In the end, injuries to key players like [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders Svensson]] and [[Stefan Ishizaki]] proved to costly, eventually having to settle for second place behind [[Kalmar FF]].
[[File:Borasarena.JPG|right|thumb|240px||[[Borås Arena]] opened a new era for Elfsborg.]]
The following year, IF Elfsborg once again challenged for a place in European football, brushing aside Hungarian side [[Szombathelyi Haladás]] and Portuguese [[S.C. Braga]] before eventually falling in the last qualifying round against [[S.S. Lazio]].

IF Elfsborg were big favourites for winning the [[Allsvenskan 2009|2009]] but had problem capitalizing on their high possession and many chances and eventually ended up third behind [[AIK Fotboll|AIK]] and rivals [[IFK Göteborg]].

The following year expectations were still high, but due to a mediocre start (only nine points in the first 9 rounds), IF Elfsborgs [[Allsvenskan 2010|2010]] campaign increasingly became an uphill struggle trying, but in the end failing to catch up to [[Helsingborgs IF]] and [[Malmö FF]]. [[Malmö FF]] eventually ended up champions with IF Elfsborg in fourth place.

2010 marked IF Elfsborg's fourth consecutive season in continental football. The team entered the [[Europa League]] second qualifying round in the seeded pot having no real difficulties eliminating Moldovan side [[FC Iskra-Stal]] (on an aggregate score of 3–1). The Macedonian side [[FK Teteks]] proved to be no real challenge in the following round with IF Elfsborg effectively seeing of their opponents in an emphatic 5–0 win first leg win.

The team seemed in good shape to make a serious challenge for reaching the Europa League group stage even though they would be unseeded in the last qualifying round. Unfortunately the draw was once again one of the worst possible. [[SSC Napoli]] was held to a 1–0 win away at [[Stadio San Paolo]] following a stellar effort by new Danish signing [[Jesper Christiansen]], but the Italians proved too strong in the second leg where they cruised to a 2–0 victory, both goals scored by Uruguay international [[Edinson Cavani]].

The 2010 season was a busy year for transfers, both in and out. Sweden international [[Emir Bajrami]] making his way to [[FC Twente]] during the summer and top goalscorer [[Denni Avdic]] moving to [[Werder Bremen]] during the January transfer window. Three players were signed from Danish clubs. Former hero [[Jon Jönsson]] was brought in from [[Brøndby IF]] during the summer to bolster the defense, goalkeeper [[Jesper Christiansen]] from [[FC København]] and right back [[Andreas Klarström]] from [[Esbjerg fB]] making a comeback to the club.

The club made some more signings during the 2010–2011 winter. Most notable were forward [[Lasse Nilsson]] from [[Vitesse Arnhem]], central defender [[Andreas Augustsson]] from [[Randers FC]] and target man [[David Elm (footballer)|David Elm]] from [[Fulham F.C.]]. Once again, many of the media pundits were thinking that IF Elfsborg were firm favourites to win the [[2011 Allsvenskan|2011]].

In early spring former [[allsvenskan]] top goalscorer [[Fredrik Berglund]] decided to hang up his boots.

The [[2011 Allsvenskan|2011]] campaign showed an IF Elfsborg seemingly set on playing a more straightforward counter-attacking game, at least away. This seemed to be a recipe for success since the team started grabbing a few more away wins here and there. after the first half of the season the team was trailing [[Helsingborgs IF]] at the top of the table. Young left winger [[Niklas Hult]] was the standout player during the first half of the season, quickly establishing himself in the team and being touted by some members of the press as "the new [[Fredrik Ljungberg]]".

In continental football, IF Elfsborg entered the fray in the first qualifying round of the Europa League. [[CS Fola Esch]] were brushed aside after winning 4–0 in the first leg at home and drawing (1–1) away.

==Colours and crest==
[[File:I15 fana 1849.JPG|thumb|210px|left|The colors yellow and black in Elfsborg derived from Royal [[Älvsborgs regemente]].]]
Ever since [[Elfsborg]] was established they wore the main colour yellow with some strikes of black. The yellow and black color originates in [[Älvsborg County|Älvsborg]], and it was [[Älvsborgs regemente]]<ref name="Elfsborgs färger">{{cite web |url=http://www.guliganerna.se/v5/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EL-bladet-Nummer-1-2012.pdf|title=Elfsborgs färger|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> that had yellow and black color on their flag, which meant that Elfsborg of course would play in these colors. So it became yellow shirts and black shorts. The costumes remained pure in the colors yellow and black with no club text scrolling on the chest or back. They were simply pure in their colors, and it remained so until the 1940s when trends over Sweden was to adorn their badge on the shirt. In this manner, they could strengthen their brand even more. For Elfsborgs part it was the classic black text [[Elfsborg]] in italics placed on the chest at the heart. From 1940 until 2007, almost 50 years, the classic text Elfsborg decorated chest. From 2007 there was a change to what is now the official club emblem there, an emblem derived from the 1970s and has appeared in several versions at most of Elfsborg sections. It is a crown of yellow and black with Elfsborg engraved in it and a football at the top. The reason for the change was mainly to promote the club brand. They wanted a brand that people and companies could associate themselves with&nbsp;– instead of a text as before.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elfsborgslaktaren.blogspot.se/2007/10/vad-betyder-emblemet-p-brstet.html|title=Emblemets historia|work= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svenskafans.com/fotboll/103123.aspx|title=Helgult?

[[File:Old crest of football team IF Elfsborg.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Old crest used before the 1970s.]]
Elfsborgs reserve kit is red, and become so during a match against the [[Swedish national football team]] in 1941. In the beginning it was planned to be a match between the [[Finland national football team]] and the [[Swedish national football team]] in a celebration to Elfsborgs new arena [[Ryavallen]]. But Elfsborg had to replace a war-torn Finland due to the [[second world war]] in a match against the Swedish national team. Amazingly enough, Elfsborg won with 2–1 and the story behind the red kit was that Sweden played in yellow which also Elfsborg did, so they had to change colors and red was the only one available on short notice, it was borrowed from Borås Wäferi who had a red and white kit. This eventually became a symbolic color due the victory for Elfsborg and so it remained as a reserve kit. The colours red and white is also the symbol of the city [[Borås]], their coat of arms is in the colours of [[red]] and [[white]] with the two sciccors. Elfsborg became with this victory the only team in [[Allsvenskan]]s history to ever beat the [[Swedish national football team]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elfsborg.se/1940|title=Elfsborg besegrade det svenska landslaget|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref>

===Sponsorship===
The shirts remained long without a major sponsor, which would obviously affect the economy. When [[Elfsborg|IFE]] harrowed in Division 1 South in
the early 1990s, Olle Blomqvist CEO of [[Ellos]] went in with large sums of money and saved the association by becoming the major sponsor, not because he is particularly interested in football. But above all because he knows the importance Elfsborg had to [[Borås]] and Sjuhärad. Ellos became such a strong sponsor that people "named" Elfsborg teasingly to ellos due text adorned the shirts so clearly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sportnik.com/group/27414/sponsor/247009|title= Ellos storsponsor|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}</ref> In 2010 a survey showed that Elfsborg was second best in [[Allsvenskan]] in getting sponsorship money and to establish and maintain contact with their [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fotbollskanalen.se/allsvenskan/malmo-basta-idrottsklubb-pa-sponsorer---elfsborg-nast-bast-pa-attonde-plats/|title= Elfsborg näst bäst i allsvenskan inom sponsorsektorn|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref> The same year beat Elfsborg a record in local sponsorships around Sjuhärad when it increased from 28 to 33 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bt.se/sport/elfsborg_i_allsvenskan/elfsborg-slar-rekord-i-lokal-sponsring(1231988).gm|title=  Elfsborg ökade sin sponsring under 2010|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}</ref>

Elfsborg have significantly signed a contract with [[Umbro]] up to this date to use their collection of both soccer shoes and clothes. Umbro has such a strong sponsorship, enough to be mentioned on a department of [[Borås Arena]] to "umbrocorner". But it was not until recently that they signed contract with major sportbrands. Earlier teams always sewed their own shirts, but with a contract from a major label it gave the teams new models every year of the shirts&nbsp;– which gives economically a supplement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.joyfulgiftcard.com/index.php?id=11&ce=77&no_cache=1|title=Umbro tröjsponsor|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

==Stadiums==
{{See also|Ramnavallen|Ryavallen|Borås Arena}}

===Ramnavallen===
One of the first homegrounds to Elfsborg was a small pitch of grass in Folkparken (Ramnaparken today). However Elfsborg noticed quickly that it required more space to be on, both for training and matches. They went to [[Fristad]] and Fristads hed where they practiced and played, due to the more space. Next ground that was in [[Borås]] was Apotekarnas Mosse who would later become today's [[Ramnavallen]].<ref name="Elfsborgs färger"/>

Ramnavallen was completed in [[1922–23 in Swedish football|1922]] and then got Elfsborg finally run out on his long awaited stadium, Ramnavallen. At its time, this was a very modern stadium even though it initially took only 2.700 spectators. [[Borås Tidning]] was lyrical about the contribution and described the stadium as impressive from the provincial point of view and because it had high international standards. Elfsborg first [[Allsvenskan]] league match on Ramnavallen was played in 1926 and guests were [[Örgryte IS]]. 3887 spectators came and saw Evert Lundqvist make the only goal for the guests. The next season became the first yellow and black premiere triumph on the new stadium. [[AIK]] came to Ramnavallen and were defeated with 2–1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elfsborg.se/nyheter/a-laget/38-infoer/2594-seriepremiaer-oemsom-vin-oemsom-vatten|title=Ramnavallen seriepremiär|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

Elfsborg kept ramnavallen as a homeground until 1941 and during this time managed to win three league titles. Attendance record of ramnavallen was against AIK [[1935–36 in Swedish football|7 June 1936]], the end game before the league gold, 16.348 spectators came to see Elfsborg win their first league title in history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svenskafans.com/fotboll/127375.aspx|title=Elfsborgs första guld|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

===Ryavallen===
[[File:Play order for the FIFA World Cup 1958.jpg|thumb||right|180px|Play order for the FIFA World Cup 1958, [[Borås]] and [[Ryavallen]] are number 22.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=15/results/matches/match=1332/report.html|title=Ryavallen VM 1958 Soviet-Österrike|work= |accessdate=2012-07-19}}</ref> ]]
[[Ryavallen]] was completed in 1941 and became first of all the new homeground of IF [[Elfsborg]]. But it was also [[Borås]] first major sports [[stadium]], where the usual track and field could be exercised. Hence the athletics track along the pitch. Before one grandstand was demolished in 2005 the capacity was 19.400, to today's approximately 7,000. The old Ryavallen in Borås will get a facelift in 2012. Prior to Swedish [[Athletics (sport)|Athletics]] [[Championship]] 2013, the current six running tracks widened to eight, and both seat grandstand and the earthworks plan is stripped to make room. The old legendary dikes on Ryavallen gets a proper scratch when Ryavallen upgraded for 13 million [[Swedish krona|SEK]]. After the renovation, Ryavallen will not be approved to play football on by [[Swedish Football Association]] nor [[UEFA]], it will in the future only be used for the purpose of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=95&artikel=4973293|title=Ryavallen renoveras|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://elfsborgslaktaren.blogspot.se/2008/03/bevara-vr-stplatskultur-del-ii.html|title=Ryavallen kultur|work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

At one point came ryavallen to be used for a [[championship]]. During the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted the matches between USSR and Austria, and between England and Austria. The Soviet Union won their match against [[Austria]] with 2–0, and England had a draw against Austria, 2–2. A championship where Sweden came as a surprise to the finals where they faced Brazil. It ended with a 5–2 loss, but an honorable second place which is the best Sweden performed in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vm-fotboll.se/vm-historia-sverige.html|title=VM 1958|work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>
[[File:Ryavallen in the 60s.jpg|thumb||left|250px|Youth team of IF Elfsborg, standing in front of Ryavallen during early 60s.]]
The most memorable event in Ryavallen was the gold game against [[Örgryte IS]]&nbsp;– 1961. Elfsborg faced [[Örgryte]] on Ryavallen and plays 1–1. When the final whistle sounded, it was clear that Elfsborg as first team come up from Division 2 and immediately won [[Allsvenskan]] gold. This made them historic. This was the fourth league gold for Elfsborg. Another very memorable moment of the more terrible degree was when the grandstand collapsed against [[IFK Göteborg]]&nbsp;– 1979. The reason was because of the high spectator pressure (19,170) the grandstand collapsed and 10 people had to get to hospital. A memorable moment of the weirder degree was an own goal by [[Husqvarna IF]] in the final minutes&nbsp;– 1958. Elfsborg played against [[Husqvarna IF]] and it is 0–1 with ten minutes left. A Husqvarna player receives the ball just outside his own penalty area. He then shoots, hard and accurate an untakeable shot into his own goal. No one understands why, and the match ends 1–1. In the newspaper the day after he explains that he was so tired that he did not know which side of the pitch he had found himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bornyellow.com/html/ovrigt/tidernasogonblick.htm|title=Ryavallens största ögonblick|work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

25 October 2004 would be a historic game before kickoff. Elfsborg met [[Hammarby IF|Hammarby]] and that was the last game ever at Ryavallen. The arena had become too old after 63 years of service. In 2005 Elfsborg moved to its new modern arena, [[Borås Arena]], and ryavallen was converted completely to only fit for [[athletics (sport)|athletics]].

===Borås Arena===
[[File:Algardslaktaren Borås Arena.jpg|thumb||Right|250px|Ålgårdsläktaren, in a derby against [[IFK Göteborg]].]]
[[Borås Arena]] is a football stadium in [[Borås]], Sweden. It is the home ground of IF Elfsborg and [[Norrby IF]] and was opened on 17 April 2005. Borås Arena has an [[artificial turf]] pitch, and was changed to the most modern synthetic turf on the market during the [[UEFA Euro 2012]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elfsborg.se/nyheter/oevrigt/91-oevrigt/2724-ut-med-det-gamla-in-med-det-nya|title=Borås Arena byter konstgräs|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> at a cost of £500 000. The capacity of the arena is 14,500–17,800 depending on usage, 14,800 is mostly the capacity during international matches, due the fact that [[Uefa]] would not approve the installation of seats on the standing because of fire risk which means a lower capacity is needed to be approved by Uefa. Borås Arena is located next to Elfsborgs old homeground [[Ryavallen]], both of the stadiums are built together at the roofs, which means that the new stadium is still attached to the old historical Ryavallen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elfsborg.se/biljetter/boras-arena|title=Borås Arena Fakta|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

The first construction started on 31 December 2003 and was inaugurated 17 April 2005 at a cost of 1,120 000 £. Which was very cheap at this time considering to be Sweden's most modern stadium at that time. It was an effort by [[Borås Municipality]] that went out as a lender to Elfsborg. A necessary investment for the club and the city, Elfsborg would own their own stadium by the company [[Borås]] Arena AB and would receive all revenues without any intermediaries from matches. Borås Arena didn't only open a new era for IF Elfsborg but also for other clubs in [[Allsvenskan]], Elfsborg was the first club to build a new arena owned by their own [[investment company]]. Many other clubs have built new arenas copying the model Elfsborg set up, trying to own their arena which gives big economic resources. Borås Arena consists of four main grandstands; Knallelandsläktaren, Ålgårdsläktaren, Sjuhäradsläktaren and Elfsborgsläktaren.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svenskelitfotboll.se/sefaktuellt/borasarena_juni.htm|title=Borås Arena Kostnader|work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>
[[File:Ålgårdsläktaren070705.jpg|thumb||left|250px|Ålgårdsläktaren, in a [[Tifo]] arrangement.]]
The first game at Borås Arena was between IF Elfsborg vs [[Örgryte IS]] on 17 April 2005 in the top Swedish league, [[Allsvenskan]]. The game ended in a 1–0 victory for Elfsborg, [[Daniel Mobaeck]] scoring the only and first goal in history on Borås Arena. The current record attendance is 17,070 and was set 4 July 2005 in a game between IF Elfsborg and [[Kalmar FF]] which marked the return of both [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders Svensson]] and [[Mathias Svensson]]. Anders Svensson also became the first on Borås Arena to score a hat-trick in the derby against rivals [[IFK Göteborg]], Elfsborg won with Anders 3 goals, 3–1. The highest attendance on an international tournament was during the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] play-off against [[Valencia CF]] where 13,148 spectators came to see Elfsborg deal with the [[Spaniards]]. Elfsborg lost with 2–1, after a goal by [[Daniel Alexandersson]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bornyellow.com/html/historia_statistik/hogstapubliksiffror.htm|title=Borås Arena Publiksiffror|work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

The stadium was originally scheduled to be a tournament site for the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]], but a [[sponsorship]] conflict with [[Max Hamburgers|Max]] fast food chain's location at the stadium and official UEFA sponsor [[McDonalds]], plus a contractual requirement for official sponsors to have a monopoly over the stadium's area, and a refusal to close the restaurant led to it losing its status as a site for the tournament. A strange conflict that led to Elfsborg and Borås Arena lost the championship as an arranger.<ref>{{cite news |title=Borås loses out in Uefa burger battle |url=http://www.thelocal.se/13182/20080721/ |work=The Local |publisher=The Local Europe |date=24 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elfsborg.se/2000|title=Elfsborg historia 2000-talet|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref> was the highlight in Borås Arenas young history. The year when Elfsborg received dividends on their great effort by salvaging the club's 5th [[List of Swedish football champions|SM-Gold]]. An explicit goal from the club was to win [[List of Swedish football champions|SM-Gold]] by 2007 and this was accomplished a year in advance, 5 November 2006. The association was strengthened at all levels for a couple of years, not least organizationally and financially, with new sports director "Mr. [[Elfsborg]]" Stefan Andreasson, President-elect Bosse "[[Bank]]" Johansson and two billionaires as external funders. The new highly skilled (and young)  manager couple [[Magnus Haglund]] and Peter Wettergren, who was employed before the 2004 season, was also of course in the club's big bet. The following year (2005) was also "[[Borås Arena|Elfsborg Fortress]]", Borås Arena, completed while enlisted old heroes in the form of [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders]] and [[Mathias Svensson]] came back. Memorable matches this season on Borås Arena was at home the victory against [[Malmö FF]] (4–2), which many described as the best in the season and where [[Anders Svensson (footballer, born 1976)|Anders Svensson]] made the teams single best effort during the season. Another memorable match was the last and crucial one. Gold match at a packed Borås Arena against [[Djurgårdens IF Fotboll|Djurgårdens IF]] where [[Joakim Sjöhage]] became gold shooter with the only goal which meant that over 40 years of waiting was over for the Elfsborgs fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bornyellow.com/html/historia_statistik/guldaren2006.htm|title=Guldåret 2006|work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=2561&artikel=1019813|title=Sverigesradio Elfsborg tar guld|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-06-24}}</ref>

[[File:Guliganer.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Guliganerna during a game against [[FK Riga]].]]
Already in the 1940s<ref>{{cite web |url= http://elfsborgslaktaren.blogspot.se/2007/05/vlkommen-till-en-ny-blogg.html|title= Supporterkulturen börjar|work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> there was the legendary [[Elfsborg]] chant ''"heja di våra, inte di dära, trampa di främmatta pöjka på tära"'' on [[Ryavallen]], at the time, including of a certain young [[Ingvar Carlsson]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.svenskafans.com/fotboll/1337.aspx|title= Ingvar Carlsson en riktig elfsborgssupporter|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> who later became [[prime minister]]. For a few years in the 1970s ''"Di Gule"'' played fantastic football and was in top contest of the Swedish [[Allsvenskan]]. At this time the British supporter culture retrieved from "Tipsextra" began to interfere and influence in Swedish [[association football|football]] culture, with an impact even on [[Ryavallen]] in [[Borås]], where the seating stand for many years was the busiest around Ryavallen and Elfsborg. A young [[supporter]] section was formed later on within Elfsborgs fanclub and the culture of being on the standing ground began to arise all along with the contemporary characteristic hat and striped scarf in Elfsborgs colours [[yellow]] and [[black]]. In the coming years, there was a small and disorganized supporter group who failed to make a big fuss.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://elfsborgslaktaren.blogspot.se/2007/05/vlkommen-till-en-ny-blogg.html|title= Influenser från engelsk läktarkultur|work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref>

===Guliganerna===
1991<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guliganerna.se/v5/?page_id=67|title= Under tyngsta period växer Guliganerna fram|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> underwent IF Elfsborg the club's probably heaviest period ever, the economy and the results weighted during the period in [[2012 Swedish football Division 1|Söderettan]]. 21 November 1991, however, formed a collection of young men, a supporter compound that would become a familiar concept not only in [[Borås]], but throughout Sweden, [[Guliganerna]]. Despite continued play in [[2012 Swedish football Division 1|Söderettan]] and low public interest in all of Sweden the supporter group, [[Guliganerna]], continued to grow. 1990s guliganer became not known for their quantity but for their faithfulness, to always be there wherever IF Elfsborg played.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.elfsborg.se/arenan/guliganerna|title= Elfsborgs största supporterförening|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> After the fan bus arrived late for an away game at some point in the mid-1990s, the players looked nervous on the stand and was worried that something happened, after this incident the players had the supporters promise to not be late for the games so as not to disturb the players focus.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://elfsborgslaktaren.blogspot.se/2007/05/vlkommen-till-en-ny-blogg.html|title= Elfsborgsspelarna märkte av Guliganernas frånvaro|work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref>
[[File:Ålgårdsläktaren och Elfsborgsläktaren Borås Arena.jpg|left|thumb|250px|IF Elfsborg supporters '''Guliganerna''', ''founded 1991'', arranging a [[tifo]].]]
In 1997, was IF Elfsborg back in the top tier of [[Swedish football]] and that also meant an upturn for [[Guliganerna]], in −97 was the first Elfsborg [[Tifo]] group founded, ''TGD (Tifosi Guligan Divisione)'',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guliganerna.se/v2/gts.php|title= Elfsborgs första tifogrupp|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> who had a few tifos before the members quit for various reasons in 1999, mainly because they had no financial backing. Year 2000 became the starting year of the great generation change that occurred in Elfsborgs supporterlines until now, a group of young boys founded the current tifo group, ''GTS (Guligan Tifo Support)'',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guliganerna.se/v5/?p=14741|title= Guligan Tifo Support bildas år 2000|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> and a more youthful profile became clear among Elfsborgs supporter sections.

2006 was 45-years of waiting over. The club had won [[List of Swedish football champions|national championship]] which also meant an increased interest around [[Elfsborg]]. In 2011 Guliganerna had their 20th anniversary celebrated, the tribute was made in connection with the game against [[Kalmar FF]], the players wore specially made anniversary T-shirts and GTS arranged the most expensive [[tifo]] ever in the history of the club.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bt.se/sport/elfsborg_i_allsvenskan/guliganerna-star-for-stamningen(3192497).gm|title= Guliganerna firar storartat 20-års jubileum|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> Guliganerna also broke during the same year, a new member record of 1155 people, making Guliganerna Sweden fifth largest fan base in the 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guliganerna.se/v5/?p=20330|title= Guliganerna är femte största supporterförening i Sverige 2011|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref>

Elfsborgs main antagonist and rivalry is pointed against [[IFK Göteborg]] and has been so since all the way back in the 1920s. The geographical position between the cities makes it Elfsborgs only and closest [[Local derby|derby]] also called ''"El Västico"'',<ref>{{cite web |url= http://blogg.gp.se/balkander/2012/05/04/6139/comment-page-1/|title= Västderby eller El Västico|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> which also reflects the attendance figures since it is almost always sold out in these games. Guliganerna and Peking Fanz (supporters of [[IFK Norrköping]]) however has a completely own history among Swedish supporters, a history that stands as a thorn in the eyes of other supporter organizations in Sweden. This friendship is based on that Guliganerna in the 1990s invited visiting supporters before the match, Peking Fanz invited back several times and the friendship was born.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guliganerna.se/v5/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/el-bladet-nummer-2.pdf|title= Peking och Elfsborg är in som dom andra!|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref> Since this friendship was born, both supporter bases now often follow each other's games, which makes Guliganerna and Peking Fanz unique. Especially between Elfsborgs only [[ultras]] group ''Yellow Fanatics'', there are strong links with the [[IFK Norrköping]], Peking ultras.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.guliganerna.se/v2/yf.php|title= Yellow Fanatics|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-07-03}}</ref>

==Records==
{{Main|IF Elfsborg records and statistics}}
In the 2013 [[Elfsborg]] played their 70th season in [[Allsvenskan]] from its inception in 1924 up to and including the 2013 season. This placing them on a 5th place of those teams who have participated in total seasons. They have also played top-flight football continually in Sweden since 1997, which currently is the 3rd longest top-flight tenure of any club in Sweden—the longest one is [[IFK Göteborg]], since 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bornyellow.com/html/historia_statistik/allmanstatistik/allmantife.htm|title=Elfsborgs säsonger totalt och i sträck|work= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref>

The club is currently placed 5th in the [[Allsvenskan#All-time Allsvenskan table|all-time Allsvenskan table]], "maratontabellen" in Swedish, which is a cumulative record of all match results, points, and goals of every team that has played in Allsvenskan since its inception in 1924–25.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/historik/maratontabell/|title=Elfsborg 5:a på maratontabellen|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref> Furthermore, Elfsborg is placed 6th in the all-time medal table, with a total of 24 medals of different value&nbsp;– the most recent was received in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svd.se/sport/vilt-firande-av-elfsborgs-guld_7641682.svd|title=Elfsborg vinner guld och sin 24:e medallj|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref>

The player in IF Elfsborg who holds most club and national records is [[Sven Jonasson]]. In 409 games, most appearances ever in Elfsborg, he scored a total of 252 goals in Allsvenskan, which makes it an all-time record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bornyellow.com/html/historia_statistik/allmanstatistik/seriemalife.htm|title=Sven Jonasson allsvenska rekord|work= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref> He played in Elfsborg throughout his career, which started in 1927 and ended 1947, a total of 20 years. What's more, the most remarkable achievement is his unbreakable record of 344 games in consecutive. A record that was broken in a most unfortunate way, he missed his first game in 14 years because of failure to receive furlough during his military service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://svenskfotboll.se/landslag/hall-of-fame/sfs-hall-of-fame/?profile=16740|title=Sven Jonasson svit avbröts|format= |work= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref> He was also the first goalscorer ever for the [[Sweden national football team]] in a [[FIFA World Cup|worldcup]]. It was in the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], where he scored two goals in Sweden's 3–2 victory against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.se/fotboll/world-cup/1934/sverige-argentina_mtc315566/live.shtml|title=Sven Jonasson första svenska målskytt i VM någonsin|work= |accessdate=2012-12-06}}</ref>
