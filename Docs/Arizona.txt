'''Arizona''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Arizona.ogg|ɛr|ɪ|ˈ|z|oʊ|n|ə|}}; {{IPAc-en|ær|ɪ|ˈ|z|oʊ|n|ə}}) ({{lang-nv|''Hoozdo Hahoodzo''}}; [[O'odham language|O'odham]]: ''Alĭ ṣonak'') is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southwestern United States|southwestern region of the United States]]. It is also part of the [[Western United States]] and of the [[Mountain States|Mountain West]] states. It is the [[list of U.S. states and territories by area|sixth largest]] and the [[list of U.S. states and territories by population|14th most populous]] of the 50 states. Its [[capital city|capital]] and largest city is [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. Arizona is one of the [[Four Corners]] states. It has borders with [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], [[California]], and [[Mexico]], and one point in common with the southwestern corner of [[Colorado]]. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626&nbsp;km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of [[Sonora]] and [[Baja California]].

Arizona is the 48th state and last of the [[contiguous United States|contiguous states]] to be admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. It was previously part of the territory of ''[[Alta California]]'' in [[New Spain]] before being passed down to independent Mexico and later ceded to the United States after the [[Mexican–American War]]. The southernmost portion of the state was acquired in 1853 through the [[Gadsden Purchase]].

[[Southern Arizona]] is known for its [[desert]] climate, with very hot summers and mild winters. [[Northern Arizona]] features forests of pine, [[Douglas fir]], and [[spruce]] trees; the [[Colorado Plateau]]; some mountain ranges (such as the [[San Francisco Peaks|San Francisco Mountains]]); as well as large, deep [[canyon]]s, with much more moderate summer temperatures and significant winter snowfalls. There are [[skiing|ski resorts]] in the areas of [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], [[Alpine, Arizona|Alpine]], and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. In addition to the [[Grand Canyon National Park]], there are several [[U.S. National Forest|national forests]], [[National parks (United States)|national parks]], and [[National parks (United States)|national monuments]]. About one-quarter of the state<ref>[http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/usaweb/snapshot/Arizona.htm All about Arizona]. sheppardsoftware.com. Retrieved September 21, 2010.</ref> is made up of [[List of Indian reservations in Arizona|Indian reservations]] that serve as the home of [[Indigenous peoples of Arizona#Tribal entities in Arizona|a number of Native American tribes]].

==Etymology==
The name of the state appears to originate from an earlier Spanish name, ''Arizonac'', derived from the [[O'odham language|O'odham]] name ''alĭ ṣonak'', meaning "small spring", which initially applied only to an area near the Mexican silver mining camp of [[Planchas de Plata, Sonora]].<ref>Bright, William (2004).

(1983). ''Dictionary: Tohono O'odham/Pima to English, English to Tohono O'odham/Pima''.

There is a misconception that the state's name originated from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term for "Arid Zone". The Spanish phrase for "arid zone" would be ''zona árida'' in Spanish.<ref name=AZC070211>{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/columns/articles/0211clay0211.html|title=No, 'arid zone' not the basis of state's name |publisher=''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' |accessdate=December 29, 2014 |author=Thompson, Clay |date=February 11, 2007| deadurl=no}}</ref>

Arizona is located in the Southwestern United States as one of the [[Four Corners]] states. Arizona is the sixth [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|largest state by area]], after [[New Mexico]] and before [[Nevada]]. Of the state's {{convert|113998|sqmi|km2|-3}}, approximately 15% is privately owned. The remaining area is public forest and park land, state trust land and Native American reservations.

Arizona is well known for its [[desert]] [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] region in the southern portions of the state, which is rich in a [[landscape]] of [[xerophyte]] plants such as the [[cactus]] and its climate with exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. The state is less well known for its pine-covered north-central portion of the state's high country of the [[Colorado Plateau]] (see [[Arizona Mountains forests]]).

Like other states of the [[Southwestern U.S.|Southwest]] United States, Arizona has an abundance of mountains and plateaus in addition to its desert climate. Despite the state's aridity, 27% of Arizona is forest,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://azsf.az.gov/forestry-community-forestry/urban-community-forestry |title=Urban and Community Forestry Division |publisher=Arizona State Forestry Division |accessdate=July 6, 2014}}</ref> a percentage comparable to modern-day France or Germany. The largest stand of [[ponderosa pine]] trees in the world is contained in Arizona.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/project/wildfire/Arizona/prescott/prescott.html |title=Prescott Overview |publisher=Ncsu.edu |date=May 15, 2002 |accessdate=July 25, 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr4yfCYq | archivedate = January 17, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref>

The [[Mogollon Rim]], a {{convert|1998|ft|adj=on}} [[escarpment]], cuts across the central section of the state and marks the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau, where the state experienced its [[Rodeo–Chediski Fire|second worst forest fire ever]] in 2002.

Arizona belongs firmly within the Basin and Range region of North America. The region was shaped by prehistoric [[volcanism]], followed by the cooling-off and related [[subsidence]].

The [[Grand Canyon]] is a colorful, steep-sided gorge, carved by the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]], in northern Arizona. The canyon is one of the [[Seven Natural Wonders of the World|seven natural wonders of the world]] and is largely contained in the [[Grand Canyon National Park]]—one of the first national parks in the United States. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a major proponent of designating the Grand Canyon area as a National Park, visiting on numerous occasions to hunt [[cougar|mountain lion]] and enjoy the scenery. The canyon was created by the Colorado River cutting a channel over millions of years, and is about {{convert|277|mi}} long, ranges in width from {{convert|4|to|18|mi|0}} and attains a depth of more than {{convert|1|mi}}. Nearly two billion years of the [[Earth]]'s history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut through layer after layer of sediment as the Colorado Plateau uplifted.

Arizona is home to one of the most well-preserved meteorite impact sites in the world. Created around 50,000 years ago, the Barringer Meteorite Crater (better known simply as "[[Meteor Crater]]") is a gigantic hole in the middle of the high plains of the Colorado Plateau, about {{convert|25|mi|km}} west of [[Winslow, Arizona|Winslow]].  A rim of smashed and jumbled boulders, some of them the size of small houses, rises {{convert|150|ft|m}} above the level of the surrounding plain. The crater itself is nearly 1&nbsp;mile (1.6&nbsp;km) wide, and {{convert|570|ft|m}} deep.

Arizona is one of two U.S. states that does not observe [[Daylight Saving Time]] (the other being [[Hawaii]]), except in the [[Navajo Nation]] (which does observe Daylight Saving Time), located in the northeastern region of the state.

===Earthquakes===
Generally, Arizona is at low risk of earthquakes, except for the southwestern portion which is at moderate risk due to its proximity to Southern California. On the other hand, Northern Arizona is at moderate risk due to numerous faults in the area. The regions that are at lowest risk in the state are near and west of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/arizona/hazards.php|title= Arizona|publisher=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program Earthquake.Usgs.Gov|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}</ref>

The earliest Arizona earthquakes were recorded at [[Fort Yuma]], on the [[California]] side of the [[Colorado River]]. They were centered near the Imperial Valley, or [[Mexico]], back in the 1800s. In 1887, [[Douglas, Arizona|Douglas]] felt the shock of a magnitude 7.2 earthquake with an epicenter 40 miles to the south in the Mexican state of [[Sonora]].<ref name="earthquake.usgs">{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/states/arizona/history.php|title= Arizona|publisher=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program Earthquake.Usgs.Gov|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}</ref>  The first damaging earthquake known to be centered within Arizona's borders occurred on January 25, 1906, also including a series of other earthquakes centered near [[Socorro, New Mexico]]. The shock was violent in Flagstaff.

In September 1910, a series of fifty-two earthquakes caused a construction crew near Flagstaff to leave the area. In 1912, the year Arizona achieved statehood, on August 18, an earthquake caused a 50-mile crack in the [[San Francisco Peaks|San Francisco Range]]. In early January 1935, the state experienced a series of earthquakes, in the [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma area]] and near the [[Grand Canyon]]. Arizona experienced its largest earthquake in 1959, with a tremor of a magnitude 5.6. It was centered near [[Fredonia, Arizona|Fredonia]], in the northwestern part of the state near the border with [[Utah]]. The tremor was felt across the border in the neighboring states of [[Nevada]] and Utah.<ref name="earthquake.usgs" />

==Climate==
Due to its large area and variations in elevation, the state has a wide variety of localized climate conditions. In the lower elevations, the climate is primarily desert, with mild winters and extremely hot summers. Typically, from late fall to early spring, the weather is mild, averaging a minimum of 60&nbsp;°F (16&nbsp;°C). November through February are the coldest months, with temperatures typically ranging from 40 to 75&nbsp;°F (4 to 24&nbsp;°C), with occasional frosts.<ref name="wrcc">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/ARIZONA.htm |title=Arizona Climate |date=December 7, 2001 |accessdate=December 28, 2011 |publisher=Desert Research Institute, Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, Nevada }}</ref>

About midway through February, the temperatures start to rise again, with warm days, and cool, breezy nights. The summer months of June through September bring a dry heat ranging from 90–120&nbsp;°F (32–49&nbsp;°C), with occasional high temperatures exceeding 125&nbsp;°F having been observed in the desert area.<ref name="wrcc" /> Arizona's all-time record high is 128&nbsp;°F (53&nbsp;°C) recorded at [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona|Lake Havasu City]] on June 29, 1994, and July 5, 2007; the all-time record low of -40° was recorded at [[Hawley Lake, Arizona|Hawley Lake]] on January 7, 1971.

Due to the primarily dry climate, large diurnal temperature variations occur in less-developed areas of the desert above 2,500 feet. The swings can be as large as 50&nbsp;°F (28&nbsp;°C) in the summer months. In the state's urban centers, the effects of [[urban heat island|local warming]] result in much higher measured night-time lows than in the recent past.

This hot moisture brings [[lightning]], [[thunderstorm]]s, wind, and torrential, if usually brief, downpours. These downpours often cause [[flash flood]]s, which can turn deadly. In an attempt to deter drivers from crossing flooding streams, the [[Arizona Legislature]] enacted the [[Stupid Motorist Law]]. It is rare for [[tornado]]es or [[List of Arizona hurricanes|hurricanes]] to occur in Arizona.

The northern third of Arizona is a [[plateau]] at significantly higher altitudes than the lower desert, and has an appreciably cooler climate, with cold winters and mild summers, though the climate remains semiarid to arid. Extremely cold temperatures are not unknown; cold air systems from the northern states and Canada occasionally push into the state, bringing temperatures below {{convert|0|°F}} to the northern parts of the state.

Indicative of the variation in climate, Arizona is the state which has both the metropolitan area with the most days over 100&nbsp;°F ([[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]), and the metropolitan area in the lower 48 states with the most days with a low temperature below freezing ([[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/min32temp.html |title=''Mean number of Days with Minimum Temperature Below 32F'' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Retrieved March 24, 2007 |publisher=Lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov |date=August 20, 2008 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Arizona}}
[[File:North Rim of Grand Canyon, Arizona 2005.jpg|thumb|The North Rim of the [[Grand Canyon]].]]

Before the modern era, Arizona was home to numerous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] Tribes. [[Hohokam]], [[Mogollon culture|Mogollon]] and [[Ancestral Puebloans|Ancestral Puebloan]] cultures were among the many that flourished throughout the entire state before the arrival of [[Marcos de Niza]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]], in 1539. He explored parts of the state and made contact with [[Native Americans in the United States|native]] inhabitants, probably the [[Sobaipuri]]. The expedition of Spanish explorer [[Francisco Vásquez de Coronado|Coronado]] entered the area in 1540–1542 during its search for [[Quivira and Cíbola|Cíbola]]. [[Eusebio Kino|Father Kino]] was the next European in the region. A member of the [[Society of Jesus]], he led the development of a chain of missions and converted many of the Indians to Christianity in the [[Pimería Alta]] (now southern Arizona and northern [[Sonora]]) in the 1690s and early 18th century. Spain founded ''presidios'' ("fortified towns") at Tubac in 1752 and Tucson in 1775. When Mexico achieved its independence from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1821, what is now Arizona became part of the Territory of ''Nueva California'', also known as ''[[Alta California]]''.<ref>Timothy Anna et al., Historia de México.

In the [[Mexican–American War]] (1847), the US occupied Mexico City and pursued its claim to much of northern Mexico, including what later became Arizona. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (1848) specified that, in addition to language and cultural rights of the existing inhabitants being considered as inviolable, the sum of [[US$]]15&nbsp;million in compensation (equivalent to about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|15000000|1848|r=-6}}}} today{{inflation-fn|US}}) be paid to the Republic of Mexico.<ref>[[Mexican-American War]] as accessed on March 16, 2007 at 7:33 MST AM</ref> In 1853, the land below the [[Gila River]] was acquired from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]].

Arizona was recognized as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Territory by presidential proclamation of [[Jefferson Davis]] on February 14, 1862. This is the first official use of the name. Arizona supported the Confederate cause with men, horses, and supplies. Formed in 1862, [[Company A, Arizona Rangers|Arizona Scout Companies]] fought with the Confederate Army throughout the war. Arizona has the farthest recorded Western engagement of the war, the [[Battle of Picacho Pass]]. A new [[Arizona Territory]] consisting of the western half of New Mexico Territory was declared in Washington, D.C., on February 24, 1863. The new boundaries would later form the basis of the state.

Although names including "Gadsonia", "Pimeria", "Montezuma", and "Arizuma" had been considered for the territory,<ref>http://www.pima.gov/cmo/sdcp/Archives/reports/Cult.html {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5mr4ydaSD|date =January 17, 2010}}</ref> when [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] signed the final bill, it read "Arizona", and the name became permanent. ([[Montezuma (mythology)|Montezuma]] was not the [[Aztec]] emperor, but the sacred name of a divine hero to the [[Pima people]] of the [[Gila River Valley]], and was probably considered—and rejected—for its sentimental value before the name "Arizona" was settled upon.)

[[Brigham Young]] sent [[Mormons]] to Arizona in the mid- to late 19th century. They founded [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Snowflake, Arizona|Snowflake]], [[Heber-Overgaard, Arizona|Heber]], [[Safford, Arizona|Safford]], and other towns. They also settled in the [[Phoenix Valley]] (or "Valley of the Sun"), [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], and other areas. The Mormons settled what became [[northern Arizona]] and northern New Mexico, but these areas were located in a part of the former [[New Mexico Territory]].

During the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920, several battles were fought in the Mexican towns just across the border from Arizonan border settlements. Throughout the revolution, Arizonans were enlisting in one of the several armies fighting in Mexico. The Battle of Ambos Nogales in 1918, other than Pancho Villa's 1916 Columbus Raid in New Mexico, was the only significant engagement on US soil between American and Mexican forces. The battle resulted in an American victory.

After US soldiers were fired on by Mexican federal troops, the American garrison then launched an assault into Nogales, Mexico. The Mexicans eventually surrendered after both sides sustained heavy casualties. A few months earlier, just west of Nogales, an Indian War battle occurred, thus being the last engagement in the American Indian Wars which lasted from 1775 to 1918. The participants in the fight were US soldiers stationed on the border and Yaqui Indians who were using Arizona as a base to raid the nearby Mexican settlements, as part of their wars against Mexico.

Arizona became a US state on February 14, 1912. Arizona was the 48th state admitted to the US and the last of the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] to be admitted.

Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the [[Great Depression]], but during the 1920s and 1930s, tourism began to be the important Arizonan industry it is today. Dude ranches, such as the K L Bar and Remuda in Wickenburg, along with the Flying V and Tanque Verde in Tucson, gave tourists the chance to experience the flavor and life of the "Old West". Several upscale hotels and resorts opened during this period, some of which are still top tourist draws; they include the [[Arizona Biltmore Hotel]] in central Phoenix (opened 1929) and the Wigwam Resort on the west side of the Phoenix area (opened 1936).

Arizona was the site of German [[POW]] camps during World War II and [[Japanese American|Japanese-American]] internment camps. The camps were abolished after World War II. The Phoenix area German POW site was purchased after the war by the [[Maytag]] family (of major [[home appliance]] fame), and is currently the site of the [[Phoenix Zoo]]. A [[Japanese American internment|Japanese-American internment]] camp was located on [[Mount Lemmon]], just outside the state's southeastern city of Tucson. Another [[POW camp]] was located near the [[Gila River]] in eastern [[Yuma County, Arizona|Yuma County]]. Because of wartime fears of Japanese invasion of the west coast, from 1942 to 1945 all Japanese-American residents in western Washington, western Oregon, all of California, and western Arizona were required to reside in the war camps.

Arizona was also home to the [[Steele Indian School Park|Phoenix Indian School]], one of several federal institutions designed to forcibly assimilate Native American children into Anglo-American culture. Children were often enrolled into these schools against the wishes of their parents and families. Attempts to suppress native identities included forcing the children to cut their hair and take on English names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/phoenix/ |title=Archaeology of the Phoenix Indian School |publisher=Archaeology.org |date=March 27, 1998 |accessdate=July 25, 2010| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr4ydwoV | archivedate = January 17, 2010| deadurl=no}}</ref>

Arizona's population grew tremendously after World War II, in part because of the development of [[air conditioning]], which made the intense summers more comfortable. According to the ''Arizona Blue Book'' (published by the [[Arizona Secretary of State]]'s office each year), the state population in 1910 was 294,353. By 1970, it was 1,752,122. The percentage growth each decade averaged about 20% in the earlier decades and about 60% each decade thereafter.

In the 1960s, the establishment of [[retirement communities]], special age-restricted subdivisions catering exclusively to the needs of senior citizens who wanted to escape the harsh winters of the [[Midwest]] and the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] began. [[Sun City, Arizona|Sun City]], established by developer [[Del Webb]] and opened in 1960, was one of the first such communities. [[Green Valley, Arizona|Green Valley]], south of Tucson, was another such community and was designed to be a retirement subdivision for Arizona's teachers. Many senior citizens across the U.S. and [[Canada]] arrive in Arizona each winter and stay only during the winter months; they are referred to as [[Snowbird (people)|snowbirds]].

In March 2000, Arizona was the site of the first legally binding election to nominate a candidate for public office ever held over the internet.<ref>[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/News/19991003-0.html Arizona Democrats authorize Internet Voting for March 11 Advisory Primary]</ref> In the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary, under worldwide attention, Al Gore defeated Bill Bradley, and voter turnout increased more than 500% over the 1996 primary.

Three ships named [[USS Arizona|USS ''Arizona'']] have been christened in honor of the state, although only [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'' (BB-39)]] was so named after statehood was achieved.

==Economy==
[[File:Barringer Crater aerial photo by USGS.jpg|thumb|Arizona's [[Meteor Crater]] is a tourist attraction.]]
{{See also|Arizona locations by per capita income}}
The 2011 total [[gross state product]] was $259&nbsp;billion. This figure gives Arizona a larger economy than such countries as [[Ireland]], [[Finland]], and [[New Zealand]].  The composition of the state's economy is moderately diverse; although health care, transportation and the government remain the largest sectors.

The state's per capita income is $40,828, ranking 39th in the U.S. The state had a [[median household income]] of $50,448, making it 22nd in the country and just below the U.S. national mean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/2010/pdf/spi0310.pdf |title=News Release|accessdate=December 28, 2011}}</ref> Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the "five C's": copper (see ''[[Copper mining in Arizona]]''), cotton, cattle, [[citrus]], and [[climate]] (tourism). Copper is still extensively mined from many expansive open-pit and underground mines, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's output.

===Employment===
The state government is Arizona's largest employer, while [[Banner Health]] is the state's largest private employer, with over 39,000 employees (2016). As of March 2016, the state's unemployment rate was 5.4%.<ref>http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.az.htm</ref>

The top employment sectors in Arizona are (August 2014, excludes agriculture):

===Taxation===
Arizona collects personal [[income tax]]es in five brackets: 2.87%, 3.20%, 3.74%, 4.72% and 5.04%. The state [[transaction privilege tax]] is 5.6%; however, county and municipal sales taxes generally add an additional 2%.

The state rate on transient lodging (hotel/[[motel]]) is 7.27%. The state of Arizona does not levy a state tax on food for home consumption or on drugs prescribed by a licensed physician or dentist. However, some cities in Arizona, including Phoenix at 2%, do levy a tax on food for home consumption.

All fifteen Arizona counties levy a tax. Incorporated municipalities also levy transaction privilege taxes which, with the exception of their hotel/motel tax, are generally in the range of 1-to-3%. These added assessments could push the combined sales [[tax rate]] to as high as 10.7%.

Main interstate routes include I-17, and I-19 traveling north-south, I-8, I-10, and I-40, traveling east-west, and a short stretch of I-15 traveling northeast–southwest through the extreme northwestern corner of the state. In addition, the various urban areas are served by complex networks of [[List of Arizona State Routes|state routes]] and highways, such as the [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]], which is part of Phoenix's vast [[Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways|freeway system]].

===Public transportation, Amtrak, and intercity bus===
The Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas are served by public bus transit systems. Yuma and Flagstaff also have public bus systems. [[Greyhound Lines]] serves Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, Yuma, and several smaller communities statewide.

[[File:Navajo Cowboy-1.jpg|thumb|right|A Navajo man on horseback in [[Monument Valley]]]]
A [[light rail]] system, called [[Valley Metro Rail]], has recently been completed in Phoenix; it connects Central Phoenix with the nearby cities of Mesa and Tempe. The system officially opened for service in December 2008.

In Tucson, the [[Sun Link]] streetcar system travels through the downtown area, connecting the main [[University of Arizona]] campus with Mercado San Agustin on the western edge of downtown Tucson.  Sun Link, loosely based on the [[Portland Streetcar]], launched in July 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lightrailnow.org/news/n_tuc_2006-05b.htm |title=Tucson: Streetcar Plan Wins With 60% of Vote |publisher=Lightrailnow.org |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}</ref>

[[Amtrak]] ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' route serves the northern part of the state, stopping at [[Winslow (Amtrak station)|Winslow]], [[Flagstaff (Amtrak station)|Flagstaff]], [[Williams Junction (Amtrak station)|Williams]] and [[Kingman (Amtrak station)|Kingman]]. The ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' and ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' routes serve South-Central Arizona, stopping at [[Tucson (Amtrak station)|Tucson]], [[Maricopa (Amtrak station)|Maricopa]], [[Yuma (Amtrak station)|Yuma]] and [[Benson (Amtrak station)|Benson]]. Phoenix's Amtrak service was canceled in 1996, and now an Amtrak bus runs between Phoenix and the station in Maricopa.

===Aviation===
{{See also|List of airports in Arizona}}
Airports with regularly scheduled commercial flights include: [[Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport]] (IATA: PHX, ICAO: KPHX) in Phoenix (the largest airport and the major international airport in the state); [[Tucson International Airport]] (IATA: TUS, ICAO: KTUS) in Tucson; [[Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport]] (IATA: AZA, ICAO: KIWA) in Mesa; [[Yuma International Airport]] (IATA: NYL, ICAO: KNYL) in Yuma; [[Prescott Municipal Airport]] (PRC) in Prescott; [[Flagstaff Pulliam Airport]] (IATA: FLG, ICAO: KFLG) in Flagstaff, and [[Grand Canyon National Park Airport]] (IATA: GCN, ICAO: KGCN, FAA: GCN), a small, but busy, single-runway facility providing tourist flights, mostly from Las Vegas. Phoenix Sky Harbor is currently 7th busiest airport in the world in terms of aircraft movements, and 17th for passenger traffic.<ref>World's busiest airports by traffic movements</ref><ref>World's busiest airports by passenger traffic</ref>

Other significant airports without regularly scheduled commercial flights include [[Scottsdale Municipal Airport]] (IATA: SCF, ICAO: KSDL) in Scottsdale, and [[Deer Valley Airport]] (IATA: DVT, ICAO: KDVT, FAA: DVT) home to two flight training academies and the Nation's busiest general aviation airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deervalleyairport.com/index.shtml |title=Deer Valley Airport |publisher=Phoenix.gov |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref>

===Capitol complex===
[[File:Azcap.jpg|thumb||The [[Arizona State Capitol]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]]]

The state capital of Arizona is [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The original Capitol building, with its distinctive copper dome, was dedicated in 1901 (construction was completed for $136,000 in 1900), when the area was still a territory. Phoenix became the official state capital with Arizona's admission to the union in 1912.

The [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] buildings were dedicated in 1960, and an Executive Office Building was dedicated in 1974 (the ninth floor of this building is where the Office of the Governor is located). The original Capitol building was converted into a museum.

The Capitol complex is fronted and highlighted by the richly landscaped [[Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza]], named after [[Wesley Bolin]], a governor who died in office in the 1970s. Numerous monuments and memorials are on the site, including the anchor and signal mast from the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'']] (one of the U.S. Navy ships [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|sunk in Pearl Harbor]]) and a granite version of the [[Ten Commandments]].

===State legislative branch===
The [[Arizona Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] (like the legislature of every other state except [[Nebraska]]) and consists of a thirty-member [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] and a 60-member [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Each of the thirty legislative districts has one senator and two representatives. Legislators are elected for two-year terms.

Each Legislature covers a two-year period. The first session following the general election is known as the first regular session, and the session convening in the second year is known as the second regular session. Each regular session begins on the second Monday in January and adjourns ''sine die'' (terminates for the year) no later than Saturday of the week in which the 100th day from the beginning of the regular session falls. The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, by rule, may extend the session up to seven additional days. Thereafter, the session can only be extended by a majority vote of members present of each house.

The current majority party is the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], which has held power in both houses since 1993.

Arizona state senators and representatives are elected for two-year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms in a chamber, though there is no limit on the total number of terms. When a lawmaker is term-limited from office, it is not uncommon for him or her to run for election in the other chamber.

The fiscal year 2006–07 general fund budget, approved by the Arizona Legislature in June 2006, is slightly less than $10&nbsp;billion. Besides the money spent on state agencies, it also includes more than $500&nbsp;million in income- and property tax cuts, pay raises for government employees, and additional funding for the K–12 education system.

Arizona's executive branch is headed by a [[Governor of Arizona|governor]], who is elected to a four-year term. The governor may serve any number of terms, though no more than two in a row. Arizona is one of the few states that does not maintain a governor's mansion. During office the governors reside within their private residence, and all executive offices are housed in the executive tower at the state capitol. The current governor of Arizona is [[Doug Ducey]] (R).

Former Governor Jan Brewer assumed office after [[Janet Napolitano]] had her nomination by [[Barack Obama]] for [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] confirmed by the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ariz. GOP would gain if Napolitano gets Obama post |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[KTAR-FM|KTAR]] |date=November 20, 2008 |url=http://ktar.com/?nid=6&sid=994469 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}</ref> Arizona has had four female governors, more than any other state.

Other elected executive officials include the [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]], [[State Treasurer]], [[Arizona Attorney General|State Attorney General]], [[state education agency|Superintendent of Public Instruction]], [[Mine Inspector|State Mine Inspector]] and a five-member [[Arizona Corporation Commission|Corporation Commission]]. All elected officials hold a term of four years, and are limited to two consecutive terms (except the office of the state mine inspector, which is exempt from term limits).

Arizona is one of seven states that do not have a specified [[Lieutenant governor (United States)#Arizona|lieutenant governor]]. The secretary of state is the first in line to succeed the governor in the event of death, disability, resignation, or removal from office. The line of succession also includes the attorney general, state treasurer and superintendent of public instruction. Since 1977, four secretaries of state and one attorney general have risen to Arizona's governorship through these means.

===State judicial branch===
The [[Arizona Supreme Court]] is the highest court in Arizona. The court currently consists of one chief justice, a vice chief justice, and three associate justices. Justices are appointed by the governor from a list recommended by a bipartisan commission, and are re-elected after the initial two years following their appointment. Subsequent re-elections occur every six years. The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases, but almost all other appellate cases go through the [[Arizona Court of Appeals]] beforehand. The court has original jurisdiction in a few other circumstances, as outlined in the state constitution. The court may also declare laws unconstitutional, but only while seated ''[[en banc]]''. The court meets in the Arizona Supreme Court Building at the capitol complex (at the southern end of Wesley Bolin Plaza).

The Arizona Court of Appeals, further divided into two divisions, is the intermediate court in the state. Division One is based in Phoenix, consists of sixteen judges, and has jurisdiction in the Western and Northern regions of the state, along with the greater Phoenix area. Division Two is based in Tucson, consists of six judges, and has jurisdiction over the Southern regions of the state, including the Tucson area. Judges are selected in a method similar to the one used for state supreme court justices.

Each county of Arizona has a [[Arizona Superior Court|superior court]], the size and organization of which are varied and generally depend on the size of the particular county.

===Counties===
Arizona is divided into political jurisdictions designated as ''[[County (United States)|counties]]''. As of 1983 there were 15 counties in the state, ranging in size from {{convert|1238|sqmi|km2|sigfig=3}} to {{convert|18661|sqmi|km2|sigfig=4}}.

From statehood through the late 1940s, Arizona was primarily dominated by the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. During this time period, the Democratic candidate for the presidency carried the state each election, with the only exceptions being the elections of [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]], [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]] and [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]]—all three of which were national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] landslides.

Since the [[United States presidential election, 1952|election]] of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1952, however, the state has voted consistently Republican in presidential elections. Arizona voted Republican in every presidential election from 1952 to 1992, with [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] winning the state by particularly large margins. During this forty-year span, it was also the only state not to be carried by a Democrat at least once.

The closest that a Democrat came to carrying the state during this time was [[Lyndon Johnson]] in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], who lost the state by less than 5,000 votes to Arizona Senator and native [[Barry Goldwater]] (This was the most closely contested state in what was otherwise a landslide victory for Johnson that year). Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] ended this streak in [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]] when he won Arizona by a little over two percentage points (Clinton had previously come within less than two percent of winning Arizona's electoral votes in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]). However, Clinton's victory has proven to be an exception, as the state has continued to support Republican presidential candidates by solid margins in every election since.

In recent years, the Republican Party has also dominated Arizona politics in general. The fast-growing Phoenix and Tucson suburbs became increasingly friendly to Republicans from the 1950s onward. During this time, many "Pinto Democrats", or conservative Democrats from rural areas, became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and national level. While the state normally supports Republicans at the federal level, Democrats are often competitive in statewide elections; two of the last five governors have been Democrats.

On March 4, 2008, [[John McCain]] effectively clinched the Republican nomination for 2008, becoming the first presidential nominee from the state since Barry Goldwater in 1964.

Arizona politics are dominated by a longstanding rivalry between its two largest counties, [[Maricopa County]] and [[Pima County]]—home to Phoenix and Tucson, respectively. The two counties have almost 75 percent of the state's population and cast almost 80 percent of the state's vote. They also elect a substantial majority of the state legislature.

Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, and most of the state's elected officials live there. It has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1948. This includes the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]] run of native son Barry Goldwater; he would not have carried his home state had it not been for a 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County. Similarly, while McCain won Arizona by eight percentage points in 2008, the margin would have likely been far closer if not for a 130,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.

In contrast, Pima County, home to Tucson, and most of southern Arizona have historically been more Democratic. While Tucson's suburbs lean Republican, they hold to a somewhat more moderate brand of Republicanism than is common in the Phoenix area.

Arizona rejected a [[Arizona Proposition 107 (2006)|same-sex marriage ban]] in a referendum as part of the 2006 elections. Arizona was the first state in the nation to do so. [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Arizona|Same-sex marriage]] was already not recognized in Arizona, but this amendment would have denied any legal or financial benefits to unmarried homosexual or heterosexual couples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2006/11/07/2 |title=Arizona stands alone against marriage ban – Queer Lesbian Gay News |publisher=Gay.com |accessdate=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080919203109/http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2006/11/07/2 |archivedate=September 19, 2008 }}</ref> In 2008, Arizona voters passed [[Arizona Proposition 102 (2008)|Proposition 102]], an amendment to the state constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman, though by a narrower majority than similar votes in a number of other states.<ref>[http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/265756 Ban on gay unions solidly supported in most of Arizona] {{wayback|url=http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/265756 |date=20081108015350 }}</ref>

In 2010, Arizona passed [[Arizona SB 1070|SB 1070]], called the toughest [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]] legislation in the nation, igniting a fierce debate between supporters and detractors of the law.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html|work=The New York Times|title=Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration | accessdate=December 28, 2011 | first=Randal C. | last=Archibold | date=April 23, 2010}}</ref>

The [[United States Supreme Court]] heard arguments March 18, 2013, regarding the validity of the Arizona law that tries to keep illegal immigrants from voting by demanding all state residents show documents proving their U.S. citizenship before registering to vote in national elections.<ref>{{cite news|title=High court to weigh Arizona voter registration case|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/15/us-usa-court-voting-idUSBRE92E0EN20130315|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=March 17, 2013|date=March 15, 2013}}</ref>

===Same-sex marriage===
A November 2011 [[Public Policy Polling]] survey found that 44% of Arizona voters supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, while 45% opposed it and 12% were not sure. A separate question on the same survey found that 72% of respondents supported legal recognition of same-sex couples, with 40% supporting same-sex marriage, 32% supporting civil unions, 27% opposing all legal recognition and 1% not sure. Arizona Proposition 102, known by its supporters as the Marriage Protection Amendment, appeared as a legislatively referred constitutional amendment on the November 4, 2008 ballot in Arizona, where it was approved: 56.2%-43%. It amended the Arizona Constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.<ref>[http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2011/PPP_Release_AZ_1130424.pdf AZ pro-civil unions, remembers Goldwater fondly]</ref>

On October 17, 2014, Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne announced that his office would no longer object to same-sex marriage, in response to a U.S. District Court Ruling on Arizona Proposition 102.  On that day, each county's Clerk of the Superior Court began to issue same-sex marriage licenses, and Arizona became the 31st state to legalize same-sex marriage.

==Education==

===Elementary and secondary education===
Public schools in Arizona are separated into about 220 local school districts which operate independently, but are governed in most cases by elected county school superintendents; these are in turn overseen by the [[Arizona State Board of Education]] (a division of the [[Arizona Department of Education]]) and the state Superintendent of Public Instruction (elected in partisan elections every even-numbered year when there is not a presidential election, for a four-year term). In 2005, a School District Redistricting Commission was established with the goal of combining and consolidating many of these districts.

===Higher education===
[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Arizona]] located in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]].]]
[[File:Asubiodesign.jpg|thumb|[[Arizona State University]] located in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]].]][[File:Sechrist_Hall.jpg|thumb|[[Northern Arizona University]] located in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]].]]

Arizona is served by three public universities: The [[University of Arizona]], [[Arizona State University]], and [[Northern Arizona University]]. These schools are governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]].

Private higher education in Arizona is dominated by a large number of for-profit and "chain" (multi-site) universities.<ref>[http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&ct=2+3&ic=1 College Navigator – Arizona] National Center for Education Statistics, [[U.S. Department of Education]]</ref>

[[Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University, Prescott]] and [[Prescott College]] are Arizona's only non-profit four-year private colleges.<ref>[http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&ct=2+3&ic=1&pg=2&id=105589 College Navigator – Four-Year Schools in Arizona] National Center for Education Statistics, [[U.S. Department of Education]]</ref>

Arizona has a wide network of two-year vocational schools and [[community colleges]]. These colleges were governed historically by a separate statewide Board of Directors but, in 2002, the state legislature transferred almost all oversight authority to individual community college districts.<ref>2002 Legislature – HB 2710, which later became ARS 15-1444</ref> The Maricopa County Community College District includes 11 community colleges throughout Maricopa County and is one of the largest in the nation.

===Baseball===
Arizona is a popular location for [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]], as it is the site of the [[Cactus League]]. Spring training has been somewhat of a tradition{{vague|date=March 2015}} in Arizona since 1947,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} (i.e. the Cleveland Indians in [[Tucson]] until 1991, and the San Diego Padres in [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] until 1992) despite the fact that the state did not have its own major league team until the state was awarded the [[Arizona Diamondbacks|Diamondbacks]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] as an expansion team.

==Art and culture==

===Visual arts and museums===
{{See also|List of museums in Arizona}}
[[Phoenix Art Museum]], located on the historic [[Central Avenue Corridor|Central Avenue corridor]] in Phoenix, is the Southwest's largest collection of visual art from across the world. The museum displays international exhibitions alongside the museum's collection of more than 18,000 works of American, Asian, European, Latin American, Western American, modern and contemporary art, and fashion design.

The museum also has PhxArtKids, an interactive space for children; photography exhibitions through the museum's partnership with the [[Center for Creative Photography]]; the landscaped Sculpture Garden and dining at Arcadia Farms.

Arizona is a recognized center of Native American art, with a number of galleries showcasing historical and contemporary works. The [[Heard Museum]], also located in Phoenix, is a major repository of Native American art. Some of the signature exhibits include a full Navajo hogan, the Mareen Allen Nichols Collection containing 260 pieces of contemporary jewelry, the [[Barry Goldwater]] Collection of 437 historic [[Hopi kachina dolls]], and an exhibit on the 19th century boarding school experiences of Native Americans. The Heard Museum has about 250,000 visitors a year.

[[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], [[Jerome, Arizona|Jerome]], and [[Tubac, Arizona|Tubac]] are known as a budding artist colonies, and small arts scenes exist in the larger cities and near the state universities.

===Film===
{{See also|List of films shot in Arizona}}
[[File:Monument Valley 15.jpg|thumb|View of Monument Valley from [[John Ford]]'s Point]]
Several major Hollywood films, such as ''[[Billy Jack]]'', ''[[U Turn (1997 film)|U Turn]]'', ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'', ''[[Just One of the Guys]]'', ''[[Can't Buy Me Love (film)|Can't Buy Me Love]]'', ''[[Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', ''[[The Scorpion King]]'', ''[[The Banger Sisters]]'', ''[[Used Cars]]'', and ''[[Raising Arizona]]'' have been made there (as indeed have many [[Western (genre)|Westerns]]). The 1993 science fiction movie ''[[Fire in the Sky]]'', which was actually based on a reported alien abduction in the town of [[Snowflake, Arizona|Snowflake]], was set in Snowflake, but filmed in the Oregon towns of [[Oakland, Oregon|Oakland]], [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], and [[Sutherlin, Oregon|Sutherlin]].

The climax of the 1977 [[Clint Eastwood]] film ''[[The Gauntlet (film)|The Gauntlet]]'' takes place in downtown Phoenix. The final segments of the 1984 film ''[[Starman (film)|Starman]]'' take place at [[Meteor Crater]] outside [[Winslow, Arizona|Winslow]]. The [[Jeff Foxworthy]] comedy documentary movie ''[[Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie|Blue Collar Comedy Tour]]'' was filmed almost entirely at the [[Dodge Theatre]]. One of the most famous examples is [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s classic film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. Not only was some of the film shot in Phoenix, but the main character is from there, as well.

Some of the television shows filmed or set in Arizona include ''[[The New Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[Medium (TV Series)|Medium]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[The First 48]]'', ''[[Insomniac with Dave Attell]]'', ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]'', and ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''. The 1974 film ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'', for which [[Ellen Burstyn]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and also starred [[Kris Kristofferson]], was set in Tucson, the TV sitcom ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', which was based on the movie was set in Phoenix. ''[[Twilight (2008 film)|Twilight]]'' was also set in Phoenix at the beginning and the end of the film.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Arizona}}
Arizona is prominently featured in the lyrics of many [[Country and Western]] songs, such as [[Jamie O'Neal]]'s hit ballad "[[There Is No Arizona]]". [[George Strait]]'s "Oceanfront Property" uses "ocean front property in Arizona" as a metaphor for a sucker proposition. The line "see you down in Arizona Bay" is used in a [[Tool (band)|Tool]] song in reference to the possibility (expressed as a ''hope'' by comedian [[Bill Hicks]]) that Southern California will one day fall into the ocean.  [[Glen Campbell]], a notable resident, popularized the song "[[By The Time I Get To Phoenix]]".

[[File:TakeItEasy WinslowAZ.jpg|thumb|[[Standin' on the Corner Park]] and mural in [[Winslow, Arizona]]]]
"Arizona" was the title of a popular song recorded by [[Mark Lindsay]]. Arizona is mentioned by the hit song "[[Take It Easy]]", written by [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Glenn Frey]] and performed by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Arizona is also mentioned in the Beatles' song "Get Back", credited to John Lennon and Paul McCartney; McCartney sings: "JoJo left his home in Tucson, Arizona, for some California grass." "[[Carefree Highway (song)|Carefree Highway]]", released in 1974 by [[Gordon Lightfoot]], takes its name from [[Arizona State Route 74]] north of Phoenix.<ref name="Crawdaddy">{{cite journal|journal=Crawdaddy|issue=April 1975|accessdate=March 27, 2014}}</ref>
