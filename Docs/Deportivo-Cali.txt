==History==

===Amateur era===
Cali Foot-ball Club was formed in 1908, by students who came back from Europe bringing football to the city of Cali, but in 1912 the students organized the team and renamed it as Deportivo Cali beginning practice under their first coach, [[Catalan people|Catalan]] born [[Francisco Villa Bisa]]. Their first match was between CFC "A" and CFC "B" in the [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] pitch, the attendance was 300 spectators. By 1928 the name was changed to "Deportivo Cali A" and the club represented the [[Valle del Cauca]] [[Department (country subdivision)|Department]] in the National Olympics, earning the titles between 1928–30.

In 1945 several clubs decided to become part of the club adding new sports to the institution like [[athletics (track and field)|athletics]], basketball and swimming. During the next several years the club played against different teams from the country and by 1948 the team was ready to play its first professional season in the first division (Division Mayor de Football: Primera A). The first game was a defeat against [[Junior Barranquilla|Junior]] 2–0. Their first victory was against [[Atletico Nacional]] (then Atletico Municipal) 4–1. They would end the season in 8th place with a record of 6 victories, 4 draws and 8 defeats.<ref name="season">{{cite web |title=RSSSF statistics |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/col48.html |accessdate=19 August 2008 }}</ref><ref name="Historia">{{cite web |title=Historia del Deportivo Cali |url=http://www.deporcali.com/deporcali/notas/Julio162003/resena.php |accessdate=20 August 2008 }}</ref>

===Golden years===
Between 1965–74 Deportivo Cali saw its golden age era. During this period, Deportivo Cali achieved 11 finals, from which they won 5 of their 9 Colombian championship titles in the [[Copa Mustang]]. It was then that Deportivo Cali was one of the top teams from the national league in Colombia. In 1978 Deportivo Cali reached the [[Copa Libertadores de America]] final losing against Boca Juniors from Argentina. During the 1980s Deportivo Cali began to fall behind in championship titles and lost three finals against its home rival América de Cali. Among the key players in Deportivo Cali were [[Carlos Valderrama (footballer)|Carlos "El Pibe" Valderrama]] and [[Bernardo Redín]]. In 1996, twenty two years after Deportivo Cali won its last championship title (1974), The Green Ones raised another star under the guidance of coach [[Fernando "El Pecoso" Castro]], and famous goal keeper [[Miguel Calero|Miguel "El Show" Calero]]. Two years later, during the 1998–99 season Deportivo Cali won Copa Mustang in 1998 and reached the 1999 [[Copa Toyota Libertadores]] final for the second time in its history. Unfortunately, luck wasn't on their side and they lost to [[Palmeiras]] of Brazil during PK's (Deportivo Cali Shot Takers: [[Rafael Dudamel]], [[Hernan Gaviria]], [[Mario Yepes]], [[Gerardo Bedoya]] (missed), [[Martín Zapata]] (Missed). Palmeiras 4, Dep. Cali 3, 4–3 Final Penalty Score, over a 2–2 aggregate score. It was during this time period that Deportivo Cali had many of the best players to come across the Colombian soccer league. This team included: [[Jose Rosendo Toledo]], "El Moño" Muñoz, [[Miguel Escobar]], [[Oscar Lopez]], [[Mario Sanclemente]], [[German "El Burrito" Gonzalez]], [[Jose Yudica]], [[Miguel Angel "El Mago" Loayza]], [[Jairo "El Maestrico" Arboleda]], [[Oscar Mario "Tranvia" Desiderio]], [[Diego Edison Umaña]], [[Henry "La Mosca" Caicedo]], [[Iroldo Rodriguez de Oliveira]], [[Jorge Ramirez Gallego]], [[Roberto Alvarez]], [[Quarentinha]], [[Bernardo "El Cunda" Valencia]], and [[Ricardo Pegnoty]]. Unfortunately, most of these players did not receive international fame, yet [[Jairo Arboleda]] could have been one of the best players Colombia has had in midfield along with [[Carlos Valderrama]]. Similar to Valderrama, Arboleda used a variety of skill and "magic" that left opponents lost and beaten, which gave rise to his nickname "El Maestrico". He is mostly recognized in Cali as one of Colombia's best players ever. This is true in most parts of Colombia except for Antioquia, where their pride dominates and mislead people to believe the best players come from Antioquia, especially Medellín. [[Jairo Arboleda]] was unfortunate to be called to the Colombian National team at a time when the team was not fully developed and organized, fading away his skill at an international level.

===Recent years===
In recent years (2000–07), the club has seen a major downfall in quality of players, quality of team and general managers, and overall result in both [[Copa Mustang]], and [[Copa Toyota Libertadores]]. During this time frame, Cali won 1 more championships (2005), but lost finals to the underdog teams such as [[Deportes Tolima]], and [[Deportivo Pasto]]. Not only this, but during this time, Deportivo Cali, for the first time in Copa Mustang history, did not make it to what the [[DIMAYOR]] calls the "Cuadrangulares", or the "semi-finals" of the cup. In the recent 2007 Finalization season, Deportivo for the second time in club history, failed to make it to the cuadrangulares. Spectators say that the down fall of the 2007 season way a result of the major injury of [[Sergio Herrera]], and the departure of [[Martin Cardetti]]. During the time frame of 2006–07, the club from [[Santiago de Cali]] have seen over 3 different coaches, and 2 different ones in the 2007 Finalization season alone. Some of the coaches which served Deportivo Cali during this time are:  Omar Labruna, Nestor Otero, and Pedro Sarmiento. Deportivo Cali fans and the board of directors of Club Asociación Deportivo Cali hoped that the newly elected coach, Uruguayan Jose Daniel Carreño, would have changed the face of the club, and re-enter them back to their glory days, he failed and was replaced by Ricardo Martinez before the end of the "Cuadrangulares" during the Copa Mustang I 2008. With new a stadium and having [[Adidas]] as a sponsor, Deportivo Cali made it to the 2010–11 quarter-finals even when people were saying that they were already eliminated since they had the worst start in Deportivo Cali's history by losing the first 4 games. In the quarter-finals they were eliminated in a penalty shoot-out by [[Atlético Nacional]], in a match that could've gone either way. Deportivo Cali is also going to be present in the [[2011 Copa Sudamericana]] which is holding the draw on 28 June 2011.

===Daniel Carreño era===
Deportivo Cali, during the management of Daniel Jose Carreño, had an above average Apertura season in the [[Copa Mustang]], coming in 6th place which qualified them for the semi-finals of the Copa Mustang. In the [[Copa Colombia]], they finished 3rd place, not qualifying for further play, which was a real embarrassment, as Deportivo Cali was the favorite to win the group. During the semi-finals of the Copa Mustang, Cali failed to win the first 4 matches, losing 2, and drawing 2, and winning the fifth one, 2–1 against [[Independiente Medellín]]. After the failing to win the fourth game, it was ultimately decided by the official council of Deportivo Cali for him to be sacked, and be replaced. The successor of Daniel Carreño is [[Ricardo Martínez]].

===Start of the Ricardo Martínez era===
On 10 July 2008, the successor of Daniel Carreño was ultimately decided to be [[Ricardo Martínez]]. He was the assistant manager of the club under the management of Daniel Carreño. His first game with the club will be on 28 July, when the [[Copa Mustang]] begins. His main focus right now is to bring in players from both the national squads, and other foreign players. The other candidate for the position, Santiago Escobar, was chosen as the new manager for [[Independiente Medellín]]. On December 2009, the executives decided to re-hire José Eugenio "Cheché" Hernández as the new coach. This is the second time "Cheché" takes the team, last time he guided the team to the Championship of 1998 and to the runners-up of the Copa Toyota Libertadores of 1999 that lost against Palmeiras from Brazil after penalty kicks shoot-out.

===The Beginning of a New Era===
After the disappointing close to the season, Deportivo Cali decided to look for a new coach. On December 13, 2012, they signed a new head coach named Leonel Alvarez. Over the past few years this man has led his past teams to victories, and World Cup appearances. He was the Colombian coach from 1985–95, taking them to the United States World Cup. In addition, he has led Deportivo Cali to the play-offs for the last 2 years. In fact, this year he helped us reach the final, but it ended in disappointment. The first game was played in our home field resulting in a draw. But, the second game we lost 2–0. After this loss he knew that he was on the hot spot for losing his job. After a week of long discussion, the team finally offered him a new contract of 1,600,000 U.S dollars, which led him to stay.

In addition, he helped them build a new defense and acquire the new offseason acquisitions such as Mauricio Cassiera, Cristian Marrugo, Gustavo Bolivar, and Robin Ramirez.

===International competitions===
Deportivo Cali was the first Colombian side to dispute a [[Copa Libertadores]] final in 1978. Under coach [[Carlos Bilardo]] Deportivo Cali played against [[Boca Juniors]]. The first match in Cali ended 0–0. The second match in [[Buenos Aires]] resulted in a 4–0 victory for the Argentines.
In 1999 they also disputed the final, this time it was against Brazilian side [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]]. The first match in Cali was a victory for the home side 1–0. The second match was a 2–1 defeat. The cup was decided on penalty kicks where Deportivo Cali lost 4–3. Beside [[Copa Libertadores]] the club has also disputed the [[Copa Merconorte]] final and participated in the [[Copa Sudamericana]]. Deportivo Cali is currently ranked 3rd on the Colombian club ranking by the [[CONMEBOL]][http://www.conmebol.com/ranking_pais_index.jsp?pais=col&slangab=S].

==Super Classic==
Deportivo Cali's longtime rival is [[América de Cali|América]]. The derby is known either as the "Clásico Vallecaucano" ([[Valle del Cauca]] Derby) or the "Clásico de San Fernando" because of the location of the [[Pascual Guerrero]] stadium. The first derby was played in 1931 when the final of the Valle del Cauca league was disputed by the two teams. The result was a victory for América de Cali 1–0.<ref name="Historia2">{{cite web |title=Primer Clasico (Español) |url=http://www.nuevoestadio.com/docu/equipos1.htm |accessdate=20 August 2008 }}</ref> The first derby in the professional era was played in 1948. The first leg was a victory for América 1–0 while on the second leg of the tournament it was a Cali victory 4–3. On 10 October 2010 Deportivo Cali, for the first time in the history of its new stadium, won against América de Cali, with a final score of 6–3 which including a hat trick from Argentine player [[Martin Morel|Martin Gerardo Morel]], and three of the most highlighted goals of the tournament.<ref name="season"/> The "Super Classic" is not longer played because its rival went to the second division due to bad performance, and has been in that division since 2011.
