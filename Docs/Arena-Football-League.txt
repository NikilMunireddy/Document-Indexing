The '''Arena Football League''' ('''AFL''') is the highest level of professional [[arena football|indoor]] [[American football]] in the United States. It was founded in [[1987 in sports|1987]] by [[Jim Foster (football)|Jim Foster]], making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the [[Canadian Football League]] and the [[National Football League]]. It is played indoors on a 68-yard field (about half the distance of an NFL field), resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the [[United States Football League]] and the National Football League.

For its 2015 season, the league consisted of 12 teams, all from the United States; however, upon the completion of the regular season, the league announced that the two teams it had assumed operation of during the season would cease all operations effective immediately; a regular season game slated between the two had previously been canceled and declared a tie.  Subsequently, one of the remaining teams, the [[Spokane Shock]], severed its ties with the league to join the competing [[Indoor Football League|IFL]]. The AFL is divided into two conferences {{spaced ndash}} the American Conference and National Conference. At least for 2016, each conference will have only four teams as the champion [[San Jose SaberCats]] announced in November 2015 that they were ceasing activity for "reasons not associated with League operations."

The 2016 regular season, which began 1 April, consists of an 18-week schedule during which each team plays 16 games and has two bye weeks. Each team plays two or three games against the teams within its own conference, and two games (home/road) against each team in the other conference. The 2015 season started during the last week of March and ran weekly into late August. At the end of the regular season, all teams from each conference (the conference winner and three wild card teams) will play in the AFL playoffs, an eight-team [[single-elimination tournament]] that culminates with the championship game, known as the [[ArenaBowl]]. From 1987 to 2004, 2010 to 2011 and since 2014, the game was played at the site of the higher seeded team. From 2005 to 2008, the games were at neutral sites, [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[New Orleans]]. In 2012, the league championship returned to a neutral site and [[ArenaBowl XXV]] was held at the [[Smoothie King Center|New Orleans Arena]]; [[ArenaBowl XXVI]] was held in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].

From 2000 to 2009, the AFL had its own [[minor league|developmental league]], the [[af2]]. The AFL played 22 seasons from 1987 to 2008; internal issues caused the league to cancel its 2009 season, though the af2 did play. Later that year both the AFL and af2 were dissolved and reorganized as a new corporation comprising teams from both leagues, and the AFL returned in 2010. The Arena Football League has its headquarters in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arenafootball.com/about/contact-the-afl.html |title=Contact Us |publisher=www.arenafootball.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-13}}</ref>

The league's average game attendance since returning in 2010 has been approximately 9,500.

Jim Foster, a promotions manager with the National Football League, conceived of indoor football while watching an [[indoor soccer]] match at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1981. While at the game, he wrote his idea on a 9x12 envelope, with sketches of the field and notes on gameplay. He presented the idea to a few friends at the NFL offices, where he received praise and encouragement for his concept. After solidifying the rules and a business plan, and supplemented with sketches by a professional artist, Foster presented his idea to various television networks. He reached an agreement with [[NBC]] for a "test game".<ref name=idea>{{cite news |title=A good idea...on paper |publisher=The Florida Times-Union |date=May 12, 2001 |url=http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/051201/spo_6156030.html |accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref>

Plans for arena football were put on hold in 1982 as the [[United States Football League]] was launched. Foster left the NFL to accept a position in the USFL. He eventually became executive vice-president with the [[Chicago Blitz]], where he returned to his concept of arena football. In 1983, he began organizing the test game in his spare time from his job with the Blitz. By 1985, the USFL had ceased football operations and he began devoting all his time to arena football, and on April 27, 1986, his concept was realized when the test game was played.<ref name=idea /><ref>[http://www.arenafan.com/news/?page=origcol&writer=23&article=3254 ArenaFan Rewriting The History Books: Test Game Date Revealed To Be Wrong] (30 April 2012). ArenaFan.com quoting [[Chicago Sun-Times]] and other sources.</ref>

====Test game====
The test game was played in [[Rockford, Illinois]], at the [[Rockford MetroCentre]].<ref name=rough>{{cite news |title=Arena Football League: A history of playing rough indoors |publisher=Sports Business Journal |date=January 23, 2006 |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/49001 |accessdate=2009-08-06}}</ref> Sponsors were secured, and players and coaches from local colleges were recruited to volunteer to play for the teams, the [[Chicago Politicians]] and [[Rockford Metros]], with the guarantee of a tryout should the league take off. Interest was high enough following the initial test game that Foster decided to put on a second, "showcase", game. The second game was held on February 26, 1987 at the [[Rosemont Horizon]] in Chicago with a budget of $20,000, up from $4,000 in the test game. Foster also invited [[ESPN]] to send a film crew to the game; a highlights package aired on ''[[SportsCenter]]''.<ref name=idea />

====Inaugural season====
Following the successes of his trial-run games, Foster moved ahead with his idea for arena football. He founded the Arena Football League with four teams: the [[Tampa Bay Storm|Pittsburgh Gladiators]], [[Denver Dynamite (Arena Football)|Denver Dynamite]], [[Washington Commandos]], and [[Chicago Bruisers]].<ref name=rough /> Foster appointed legendary [[Mouse Davis|Darrel "Mouse" Davis]], godfather of the "run and shoot" and modern pro offenses, as executive director of football operations. Davis hired the original coaches and was the architect of the league's original wide-open offensive playbooks.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-03/sports/sp-834_1_arena-football-teams | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Bruce | last=Pascoe | title=Arena Football's Growing Pains : Rash of Injuries Prompts Fledgling League to Study Safety | date=July 3, 1987}}</ref>

The first game in Arena Football League history was played on June 19, 1987, between the Gladiators and Commandos at [[Mellon Arena|Pittsburgh Civic Arena]] in front of 12,117 fans.<ref>{{cite news|title=It was 21 years ago today... |publisher=ArenaFootball.com |date=June 19, 2008 |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&ATCLID=1481665&DB_OEM_ID=3500 |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100208205109/http://www.arenafootball.com:80/ViewArticle.dbml? |archivedate=February 8, 2010 }}</ref>  The game was deliberately not televised so that it could be analyzed and any follies and failures would not be subject to national public scrutiny. Following the inaugural game, tweaks and adjustments were made, and the first season continued.<ref name=idea />  The Dynamite and Bruisers played in the first-ever televised AFL game the next night, on June 20, 1987, at the [[Rosemont Horizon]] in suburban Chicago on ESPN with Bob Rathbun and [[Lee Corso]] calling the play. The broadcast showed a short clip of the Commandos-Gladiators game.<ref>{{YouTube|hzBobvynM74|Arena Football – 1987 Season – Denver Dynamite vs. Chicago Bruisers}}</ref>  Each team played six games, two against each other team. The top two teams, Denver and Pittsburgh, then competed in the first-ever AFL championship game, [[ArenaBowl I]].

On September 30, 1987, Foster filed an application with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to patent his invented sport. The patent application covered the rules of the game, specifically detailing the goalposts and rebound netting and their impact on gameplay. Foster's application was granted on March 27, 1990.<ref>{{Cite patent

===Early years (1987–1999)===
From its inception, the AFL operated in a state of semi-obscurity; many Americans had heard the term "arena football" but knew little to nothing about the league itself.

From the 1987 season until the late 1990s, the most exposure the league would receive was on ESPN, which aired tape-delayed games, often well after midnight, and often edited to match the allotted time slot. The league received its first taste of wide exposure in 1998, when [[Arena Bowl|Arena Bowl XII]] was televised nationally as part of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s old [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|''Wide World of Sports'']].

On Saturday, July 23, 1989, much of America learned of the AFL for an unintended reason, when the Pittsburgh Gladiators' head coach, Joe Haering, made football history by punching commissioner Jim Foster during a game with the Chicago Bruisers.<ref name="Chicago Tribune">{{cite news| url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-07-28/sports/8902210657_1_ray-jauch-joe-haering-league-operations-manager | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Gladiators' Coach Asks For A Thumbs Up | date=July 28, 1989}}</ref> The national media ran with the story, including a photo in ''[[USA Today]]''. The game was played between the two teams in Sacramento's [[Sleep Train Arena|Arco Arena]], as part of the AFL's 'Barnstorming America' tour. Foster had walked onto the field of play to mediate an altercation between the two teams when Haering, a former NFL assistant, punched him in the jaw. Haering was suspended without pay.<ref name="Chicago Tribune"/>

One of the league's early success stories was the [[Detroit Drive]]. A primary team for some of the AFL's most highly regarded players, including [[George LaFrance]] and Gary and Alvin Rettig, as well as being a second career chance for quarterback [[Art Schlichter]], the Drive regularly played before sold out crowds at [[Joe Louis Arena]], and went to the [[ArenaBowl]] every year of their existence (1988–1993). The AFL's first dynasty came to an end when their owner, [[Mike Ilitch]] (who also owned [[Little Caesars]] Pizza and the [[Detroit Red Wings]]) bought the [[Detroit Tigers]] baseball team and sold the AFL team.

Although the Drive moved to Massachusetts for the 1994 season, the AFL had a number of other teams which it considered "[[Dynasty (sports)|dynasties]]", including the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] (the only team that has existed in some form for all contested seasons since 1987), their arch-rival the [[Orlando Predators]], the now-defunct [[San Jose SaberCats]] of the present decade, and their rivals the [[Arizona Rattlers]].

In 1993, the league staged its first [[All-star|All-Star]] Game in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], the future home of the long-running [[New York Dragons|Iowa Barnstormers]], as a fundraiser for [[Great Flood of 1993|flood victims in the area]]. The National Conference defeated the American Conference 64–40 in front of a crowd of 7,189. The second All-Star event was in October 2013, with two games, the first in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawai'i]], the second being in [[Beijing]], China.

While some teams have enjoyed considerable on-field and even financial success, many teams in the history of the league have enjoyed little success either on or off of the field of play. There were a number of franchises which existed in the form of a series of largely-unrelated teams with little to no continuity of either coaching staffs or players under numerous management groups until they folded. One example of several which could be cited is the [[New York CityHawks]], whose owners transferred the team from New York City to [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] to become the [[New England Sea Wolves]] after two seasons, then after another two seasons were sold and became the [[Toronto Phantoms]], which lasted another two seasons until folding). There are a number of reasons why these teams failed, including financially weak ownership groups, lack of deep financial support from some owners otherwise capable of providing it, lack of media exposure, and the host city's evident lack of interest in its team or the sport as a whole.

===The new millennium (2000–2008)===
The year 2000 brought heightened interest in the AFL. Then-[[Los Angeles Rams|St. Louis Rams]] [[quarterback]] [[Kurt Warner]], who was [[Most Valuable Player|MVP]] of [[Super Bowl XXXIV]], was first noticed because he played quarterback for the AFL's Iowa Barnstormers. While many sports commentators and fans continued to ridicule the league, Warner's story gave the league positive exposure, and it brought the league a new television deal with [[Spike TV|TNN]], which, unlike ESPN, televised regular season games live. While it was not financially lucrative, it helped set the stage for what the league would become in the new millennium. Also, the year also brought a spin-off league, the [[AF2|af2]], intended to be a developmental league, comparable to the [[National Football League]]'s [[NFL Europe]]. There was a lot of expansion in the 2000s. Expansion teams included the [[Austin Wranglers]], [[Carolina Cobras]], [[Los Angeles Avengers]], [[Chicago Rush]], [[Detroit Fury]], [[Dallas Desperados]], [[Colorado Crush]], [[New Orleans VooDoo]], [[Philadelphia Soul]], [[Nashville Kats]], [[Kansas City Command|Kansas City Brigade]], [[New York Dragons]] and [[Utah Blaze]].  Some of these teams, including the Crush, Desperados, Kats, and VooDoo, were owned for at least part of their existence by the same group which owned the NFL teams in their host cities.  The NFL purchased, but never exercised, an option to buy a major interest the AFL. Of all of these teams, only the Soul still compete in the AFL as of 2016.

In 2003, the season expanded to 16 games. There were also several rule changes in this period. In 2005, players were no longer allowed to run out of bounds. The only way for a player to go out of bounds presently is if he is tackled into or deliberately contacts the side boards. This was also the first year the ArenaBowl was played at a neutral site. In 2007, [[free substitution]] was allowed, ending the "iron man" era of [[one-platoon system|one-platoon football]]. And in 2008, the "jack" [[linebacker]] was allowed to go sideboard to sideboard without being penalized for "illegal defense".<ref>{{cite web | title=ESPN – New rules make big impact – AFL | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3278531 | date=2008-03-05 | accessdate=2008-12-29 }}</ref>

===Decline (2008–2009)===
After 12 years as commissioner of the AFL, David Baker retired unexpectedly on July 25, 2008, just two days before [[ArenaBowl XXII]]; deputy commissioner Ed Policy was named interim commissioner until Baker's replacement was found. Baker explained, "When I took over as commissioner, I thought it would be for one year. It turned into 12. But now it's time."<ref>{{cite news |title=Baker resigns as AFL commissioner after successful 12 years |publisher=ESPN |date=July 26, 2008 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=3505580 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>

In October 2008, [[Tom Benson]] announced that the New Orleans VooDoo were ceasing operations and folding "based on circumstances currently affecting the league and the team".<ref>{{cite news |title=VooDoo terminates operations |publisher=New Orleans Times-Picayune |date=October 14, 2008 |url=http://www.nola.com/voodoo/t-p/?/base/sports-0/1223961679147170.xml&coll=1 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>  Shortly thereafter, an article in ''[[Sports Business Journal]]'' announced that the AFL had a tentative agreement to sell a $100 million stake in the league to [[Platinum Equity]]; in exchange, Platinum Equity would create a centralized, single-entity business model that would streamline league and team operations and allow the league to be more profitable. Benson's move to shut down the VooDoo came during the Platinum Equity conference call, leading to speculation that he had folded because of the deal.<ref>{{cite news |title=AFL owners OK sale of $100 million stake |publisher=Sports Business Journal |date=October 22, 2008 |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/60311 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>

Because of the sudden loss of the New Orleans franchise, the league announced in October that the beginning of the free agency period would be delayed in order to accommodate a [[dispersal draft]]. Dates were eventually announced as December 2 for the dispersal draft and December 4 for free agency, but shortly before the draft the league issued a press release announcing the draft had been postponed one day to December 3. Shortly thereafter, another press release announced that the draft would be held on December 9 and free agency would commence on December 11.<ref>{{cite news |title=AFL dispersal draft and free agency dates set (UPDATED 12/3) |publisher=ArenaFan Online |date=December 3, 2008 |url=http://www.arenafan.com/news/?page=pressrel&article=9493 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>  However, the draft still never took place, and instead another press release was issued stating that both the draft and free agency had been postponed indefinitely.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dispersal draft and free agency dates postponed |publisher=ArenaFan Online |date=December 9, 2008 |url=http://www.arenafan.com/news/?page=pressrel&article=9495 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>  Rumors began circulating that the league was in trouble and on the verge of folding, but owners denied those claims. It was soon revealed the players' union had agreed to cut the [[salary cap]] for the 2009 season to prevent a total cessation of operations.<ref>{{cite news |title=AFL players agree to salary cut to help league |publisher=The Grand Rapids Press |date=December 10, 2008 |url=http://www.mlive.com/rampage/index.ssf/2008/12/afl_players_agree_to_salary_cu.html |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref>  However, the announced Platinum Equity investment never materialized.

====Canceling the 2009 season====
Although the Arenafootball2 league played its tenth season in 2009, a conference call in December 2008 resulted in enough votes from owners and cooperation from the AFLPA for the AFL to suspend the entire 2009 season in order to create "a long-term plan to improve its economic model".<ref>{{cite news |title=AFL suspends 2009 season |publisher=ArenaFan Online |date=December 15, 2008 |url=http://www.arenafan.com/news/?page=pressrel&article=9497 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}</ref> In doing so, the AFL became the second sports league to cancel an entire season, after the [[National Hockey League]] cancelled the [[2004–05 NHL season|2004&ndash;05 season]] because of a [[2004–05 NHL lockout|lockout]]. The AFL also became the third sports league to lose its postseason (the first being [[Major League Baseball]], which lost its [[1994 MLB season|postseason]] in 1994 because of a [[1994 baseball strike|strike]]). Efforts to reformat the league's business model were placed under the leadership of Columbus Destroyers owner [[Jim Renacci]] and interim commissioner Policy.<ref>{{cite news |title=AFL extends health insurance of Rampage, others |publisher=The Grand Rapids Press |date=March 2, 2009 |url=http://www.mlive.com/rampage/index.ssf/2009/03/arena_football_league_extends.html |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref>

High hopes for the AFL waned when interim commissioner Ed Policy announced his resignation, citing the obsolescence of his position in the reformatted league.<ref>{{cite news |title=Acting head Policy steps aside at AFL |publisher=Sports Business Journal |date=April 6, 2009 |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/62184 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> Two weeks later, the Los Angeles Avengers announced that they were formally folding the franchise. One month later, the league missed the deadline to formally ratify the new [[collective bargaining agreement]] and announced that it was eliminating health insurance for the players.<ref>{{cite news |title=AFL axing players' health insurance; Rampage's Gowins 'less optimistic' about league's return |publisher=The Grand Rapids Press |date=May 28, 2009 |url=http://www.mlive.com/rampage/index.ssf/2009/05/afl_axing_players_health_insur.html |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> Progress on the return stalled, and no announcements were made regarding the future of the league.

On July 20, 2009, ''Sports Business Journal'' reported that the AFL owed approximately $14 million to its creditors and were considering filing for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection.<ref>{{cite news |title=Chapter 11 a possibility as AFL tries to keep hopes alive for 2010 season |publisher=Sports Business Journal |date=July 20, 2009 |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/63039 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref> In early August 2009, numerous media outlets began reporting that the AFL was folding permanently and would file for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy. The league released a statement on August 4 to the effect that while the league was not folding, it was suspending league operations indefinitely. Despite this, several of the league's creditors filed papers to force a Chapter 7 liquidation if the league did not do so voluntarily.<ref>Yerak, Becky (2009-08-11).

Following the suspension of the AFL's 2009 season, league officials and owners of af2 (which had played its season as scheduled) began discussing the future of arena football and the two leagues. With its 50.1 percent ownership of af2, the AFL's bankruptcy and dissolution prompted the dissolution of af2 as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montereyherald.com/sports/ci_13413142?nclick_check=1 |title=New arena football league in the works |last=Latzke |first=Jeff |work=Monterey Herald |date=September 24, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20141129002946/http://www.montereyherald.com/sports/ci_13413142?nclick_check=1 |archivedate=November 29, 2014 }}</ref> That league was formally considered disbanded on September 8, 2009, when no owner committed his or her team to the league's eleventh season by that deadline.<ref name=barnstormers>{{cite web |url=http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20090909/SPORTS01/90909049/1023/SPORTS |title=Barnstormers hope to land in top tier of redefined league |last=Johnson |first=Dan |work=Des Moines Register |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  For legal reasons, af2 league officials and owners agreed to form a new legal entity, '''Arena Football 1''' ('''AF1'''), with former AFL teams the [[Arizona Rattlers]] and [[Orlando Predators]] joining the former af2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=407&articleid=20090930_223_B8_Cmltnh762219 |title=League targets 24 teams |publisher=Tulsa World |date=2009-09-30 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/extra/afl/news/story?id=4512394&campaign=rss&source=ESPNHeadlines |title=New arena football league launching, will include 16 teams – ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-12-10 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref>

On February 17, 2010, AF1 announced it would use the "Arena Football League" name. The league announced plans for the upcoming season and details of its contract with [[NFL Network]] to broadcast AFL games in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |title=Arena Football League Relaunches |publisher=Arena Football League |date=February 17, 2010 |url=http://www.arenafootballmedia.com/omk.php?pid=1614&sid=S201002171952389HSP3D&pr=1769 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> AF1 teams were given the option of restoring historical names to their teams. In addition to the historical teams, the league added two new expansion franchises, the [[Dallas Vigilantes]] and the [[Jacksonville Sharks]].

For the 2011 season, the [[Philadelphia Soul]], [[Kansas City Brigade]], San Jose SaberCats, New Orleans VooDoo, and the [[Georgia Force]] returned to the AFL after having last played in 2008.  However, the Grand Rapids Rampage, Colorado Crush, Columbus Destroyers, Los Angeles Avengers, and the New York Dragons did not return. The league added one expansion team, the [[Pittsburgh Power]]. Former [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]] was one of the team's owners. It was the first time the AFL returned to Pittsburgh since the [[Pittsburgh Gladiators]] were an original franchise in 1987 before becoming the [[Tampa Bay Storm]]. The Brigade changed its name to the Command, becoming the Kansas City Command.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jqNLvPZko4I2-40y-GAj4yg0TJPAD9GBR5AG0 |title=Philadelphia Soul return to AFL |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/06/ex-champion-philadelphia-soul-returning-to-arena-football-league/1 |title=Ex-champion Philadelphia Soul returning to Arena Football League |date=June 15, 2010 |accessdate=June 15, 2010 | work=USA Today}}</ref> Even though they were returning teams, the [[Bossier–Shreveport Battle Wings]] moved to New Orleans as the Voodoo, the identity formerly owned by New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson. The [[Alabama Vipers]] moved to [[Duluth, Georgia]] to become the new [[Georgia Force]] (the earlier franchise of that name being a continuation of the first [[Nashville Kats]] franchise).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arenafootball.com/news/index.html?article_id=369 |title=News |publisher=www.arenafootball.com |date=2012-07-17 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> On October 25, 2010 the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz did not return.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.okcyarddawgz.com/news/?=139 |title=Yard Dawgz will not play in AFL in 2011 |date=October 25, 2010 |accessdate=October 25, 2010 |publisher=OKCYardDawgz.com}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The [[Milwaukee Mustangs (2009–12)|Milwaukee Iron]] also changed names to the [[Milwaukee Mustangs (1994–2001)|Milwaukee Mustangs]], the name of Milwaukee's original AFL team that had existed from 1994 to 2001.
 
In 2012, the AFL celebrated its silver anniversary for its 25th season of operations. The season kicked off on March 9, 2012. The [[Tulsa Talons]] moved to [[San Antonio, Texas]] and [[Jeffrey Vinik]] became owner of the Tampa Bay Storm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabaystorm.com/team/front-office|title=Tampa Bay Storm – The Official Web Site :: Front Office|author=Tampa Bay Storm – The Official Web Site|work=tampabaystorm.com}}</ref> The [[Dallas Vigilantes]] were left off the schedule for the 2012 season with no announcement from the management, raising speculations that either the team had suspended operations for the season or was ceasing operations altogether.  (Apparently the latter was the case as the organization did not field a team for the 2013 season or any subsequent one either.) Like the National Football League, the AFL postponed the free agency period to October 31 due to [[Hurricane Sandy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arenafootball.com/news/free-agency-period-delayed-due-severe-weather|title=Free Agency Period Delayed Due To Severe Weather|work=Arena Football League|date=2012-10-29|accessdate=2012-10-29}}</ref>

[[File:NET 10 Wireless AFL Logo.png|150px|thumb|right|The NET 10 Wireless AFL logo (2012–2014)]]
It was announced on December 12, 2012, that the AFL reached a partnership agreement with [[NET10 Wireless]] to be the first non-motorsports-related professional sports league in the United States to have a title sponsor, renaming it the NET10 Wireless Arena Football League.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/blog/2012/12/arena-football-league-to-incorporate.html Arena Football League to incorporate NET10 in its name], W. Scott Bailey, ''San Antonio Business Journal'', December 12, 2012</ref>  The redesigned website showed the new logo which incorporated the current AFL logo with the one from NET10 Wireless. The title sponsorship agreement ended in 2014 after a two-year partnership.

In 2013, the league expanded with the addition of two new franchises to play in 2014, the [[Los Angeles Kiss]] (owned by [[Gene Simmons]] and [[Paul Stanley]] of the legendary rock band [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]) and the Portland Thunder (now known as [[Portland Steel]]).

In 2014, the league announced the granting of a new franchise to former [[Mötley Crüe]] frontman [[Vince Neil]], previously part-owner of the Jacksonville Sharks. That franchise, the [[Las Vegas Outlaws (arena football)|Las Vegas Outlaws]], were originally to play in Las Vegas at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in 2015, but instead played their home games at the [[Thomas & Mack Center]], previous home to the [[Las Vegas Sting]] and [[Las Vegas Gladiators]]. After 20 years as a familiar name to the league, an AFL mainstay, the Iowa Barnstormers, departed the league to join the [[Indoor Football League]]. The [[San Antonio Talons]] folded on October 13, 2014, after the league (which owned the team) failed to find a new owner.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/sanantonio/news/2014/10/13/afl-talons-won-t-play-in-san-antonio-next-season.html AFL Talons won't play in San Antonio next season, former team executive says], W. Scott Bailey, ''San Antonio Business Journal'', October 13, 2014</ref>  On November 16, 2014, despite a successful season record-wise, the [[Pittsburgh Power]] became the second team to cease operations after the 2014 season. This resulted from poor attendance.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-sports/2014/11/17/Power-out-Arena-football-franchise-folds/stories/201411170178 Power out: Pittsburgh's Arena Football League team folds], Craig Meyer, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'', November 17, 2014</ref>  It was later announced by the league that the Power would go dormant for 2015 and were looking for new ownership.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/121514aaa.html Pittsburgh Franchise to Go Dormant for 2015], AFL website, December 15, 2014</ref>

===New executives, contraction and further expansion (2015–present)===
Jerry Kurz also stepped down as commissioner of the AFL as he was promoted to be the AFL's first president. Former [[Foxwoods]] CEO [[Scott Butera]] was hired as his successor as commissioner.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/092214aaa.html Arena Football League Names Scott Butera Commissioner], ArenaFootball.com, September 22, 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.arenafan.com/news/?page=pressrel&article=12093 Arena Football League Names Scott Butera Commissioner], ArenaFan.com, September 22, 2014</ref>

On August 9, 2015, ESPN reported that the [[New Orleans VooDoo]] and [[Las Vegas Outlaws (arena football)|Las Vegas Outlaws]] had ceased operations, effective immediately,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/080915aad.html |title=VooDoo, Outlaws Cease Operations  |publisher=Arena Football League |work=www.arenafootballleague.com |date=August 9, 2015 |accessdate=August 9, 2015}}</ref> a claim which was subsequently validated on the AFL website.  On September 1, 2015, the [[Spokane Shock]] officially left the AFL and joined the [[Indoor Football League|IFL]] under the new name [[Spokane Empire]], becoming the fifth active AFL/af2 franchise to leave for the IFL since bankruptcy ([[Iowa Barnstormers]], [[Tri-Cities Fever]], [[Green Bay Blizzard]] and [[Arkansas Twisters]]—now the [[Texas Revolution (indoor football)|Texas Revolution]]—left previously).<ref>[http://goifl.com/sports/fball/2014-15/releases/20150901oku66u IFL Announces Addition of Spokane Shock], IFL website, September 1, 2015</ref>

Rumors began swirling with regards to bringing the AFL back to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]].  Both cities have hosted franchises in the past ([[Austin Wranglers]], [[San Antonio Force]] and [[San Antonio Talons]]), but an AFL spokesman, BJ Pickard, was quoted as saying, "News to me."  Announcements have yet to be made on any sort of expansion plans.<ref name="thecapitalsportsreport.com">[http://thecapitalsportsreport.com/2015/08/06/sources-afl-to-return-to-austin-and-san-antonio-next-season Sources: AFL to return to Austin and San Antonio next season], Anthony Caruso III, ''The Capital Sports Report'', August 6, 2015</ref>  An expected "big announcement" on Friday, October 30 at a [[San Antonio Spurs]] game never came to fruition.

On November 12, the league announced the defending champion [[San Jose SaberCats]] would be ceasing operations due to "reasons unrelated to League operations". A statement from the league indicated that the AFL is working to secure new, long-term owners for the franchise. This leaves the AFL with eight teams for [[2016 Arena Football League season|2016]].<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/111215aae.html AFL Issues Statment on San Jose SaberCats], ArenaFootball.com, November 12, 2015</ref>

On January 6, 2016, the league took over "ownership and operational control" of the [[Portland Thunder]] from its previous owners.<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/010616aab.html League Takes Over Operations of Portland Thunder], ArenaFootball.com, January 6, 2016</ref> The AFL stated this move was made after months of trying work out an arrangement "to provide financial and operational support."  On February 3, 2016, it was announced that the franchise will start from scratch and no longer be called the "Thunder" as the name and trademarks belong to former franchise owner [[Terry Emmert]] (similar to the [[Jerry Jones]] move with the Desperados). AFL commissioner [[Scott Butera]] announced that a new identity will be announced at a later date.<ref>[http://portlandtribune.com/pt/12-sports/291814-169191-afl-commissioner-butera-promises-outstanding-team-for-portland-in-2016 AFL Commissioner Butera promises 'outstanding team' for Portland in 2016], Steve Brandon, ''Portland Tribune'', February 3, 2016</ref>  On February 24, 2016, the Thunder were rebranded as the [[Portland Steel]].<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/022416aae.html Portland AFL Organization Rebrands to Steel], ArenaFootball.com, February 24, 2016</ref>

The league's [[2016 Arena Football League season|2016 schedule]], announced on the league's website on December 10, 2015, shows an eight-team league playing a 16-game regular season over 18 weeks, with two bye weeks for each team, one on a rotational basis and the other a "universal bye" for all teams during the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] weekend, the first weekend in July.  All teams will qualify for the postseason, meaning that the regular season will serve only to establish [[seed (sports)|seeding]].<ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-football/spec-rel/121015aaa.html]</ref>

On February 10, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and radio station [[WTOP-FM]] first broke the story that Monument Sports and Entertainment ([[Ted Leonsis]], chairman), which also owns the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Washington Wizards]], [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]'s [[Washington Mystics]], and [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Washington Capitals]] were "close to a deal" in bring a new expansion franchise to the [[Verizon Center]].<ref name="washingtonpost.com">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/digger/wp/2016/02/10/ted-leonsis-close-to-securing-arena-football-league-team-to-play-at-verizon-center/ Ted Leonsis close to securing Arena Football League team to play at Verizon Center], Jonathan O'Connell and Dan Steinberg, ''Washington Post'', February 10, 2016</ref><ref name="ReferenceA">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/dc-sports-bog/wp/2016/03/10/ted-leonsis-to-announce-d-c-is-getting-an-arena-football-league-team/?platform=hootsuite Ted Leonsis to announce D.C. is getting an Arena Football League team], Scott Allen, ''The Washington Post'', March 10, 2016</ref>  On March 10, 2016, AFL commissioner [[Scott Butera]] announced that the deal was finalized and that the new Washington, D.C., team would begin play in 2017.<ref name="arenafootball.com">[http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/031016aaa.html AFL Lands New Team in Nation's Capital], ArenaFootball.com, March 10, 2016</ref>

==Postseason==
{{See also|ArenaBowl}}
From the league's inception through [[ArenaBowl XVIII]], the championship game was played at the home of the highest-seeded remaining team. The AFL then switched to a neutral-site championship, with [[ArenaBowl XIX|ArenaBowls XIX]] and [[ArenaBowl XX|XX]] in [[Las Vegas]]. [[Smoothie King Center|New Orleans Arena]], home of the [[New Orleans VooDoo]], served as the site of [[ArenaBowl XXI]] on July 29, 2007. This was the first professional sports championship to be staged in the city since [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck in August 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arenabowl.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=3550&ATCLID=698707 |title=ArenaBowl XXI – New Orleans |date=2006-11-30}}</ref> The [[San Jose SaberCats]] earned their third championship in six years by defeating the [[Columbus Destroyers]] 55–33.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arenabowl.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&ATCLID=1139209&DB_OEM_ID=3550 |title=SaberCats are ArenaBowl XXI Champions! |date=2007-12-13}}</ref> [[ArenaBowl XXI]] in New Orleans was deemed a success, and the city was chosen to host [[ArenaBowl XXII]], in which the [[Philadelphia Soul]] defeated the defending champion San Jose Sabercats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arenabowl.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3550&ATCLID=1351141 |title=ArenaBowl Returns to New Orleans |date=2008-03-08}}</ref> In 2010, the location returned to being decided by which of the two participating teams was seeded higher. In [[ArenaBowl XXIII]], the [[Spokane Shock]] defeated the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] at their home arena, [[Spokane Arena]], in [[Spokane, Washington]]. In [[ArenaBowl XXIV]], the Jacksonville Sharks, coming off of a victory in their conference final game four nights earlier, traveled to [[US Airways Center]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and defeated the [[Arizona Rattlers]] 73–70. [[ArenaBowl XXV]] returned to a neutral site and was once again played in New Orleans, where the Rattlers returned and defeated the Philadelphia Soul. Since 2014 the ArenaBowl has again been played at the venue of the higher-seeded team.

Goal posts are {{convert|9|ft|m}} wide with a crossbar height of {{convert|15|ft|m}} ([[National Football League|NFL]] goalposts are {{convert|18.5|ft|m}} wide with the crossbar at {{convert|10|ft|m}}). The goalside rebound nets are {{convert|30|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|32|ft|m}} high. The bottom of the nets are {{convert|8|ft|m}} above the ground. Sideline barriers are {{convert|4|ft|m}} high and made of high density foam rubber.
* Equipment: the official football is the same size and weight as a [[American football ball|National Football League ball]], but colored and marked distinctively.
* Players and formations: eight players on the field; 20-man active roster; four-man inactive roster
* Substitutions: free substitution, but some players play both ways either by choice or to step in because of [[injury]]. (The free substitution rule was adopted in 2007; prior to this, the AFL mandated a one-platoon system, from which two players on each side of the ball, the "[[specialist (arena football)|specialists]]" and the quarterback or kicker, were exempt.)
* Formation: four offensive players must line up on the line of scrimmage. Three defensive players must be down linemen (in a three or four-point stance). Only the "Mac" linebacker may blitz on either side of the center. Alignment is two or more yards off the line of scrimmage. No stunting or twisting. Offensive motion in the backfield: one receiver may go in a forward motion before the snap.
* Timing: four 15 minute quarters with a 12-minute halftime (in the ArenaBowl, 30). The clock stops for out-of-bounds plays and incomplete passes only in the last minute of each half and overtime and when the referee deems it necessary for penalties, injuries or timeouts. Each team is allowed three time-outs per half. In the last minute of the game, the clock stops if the team with the lead has the ball and fails to advance the ball past the line of scrimmage; this discourages teams with the lead from "taking a knee" (i.e., having the quarterback kneel shortly after taking the snap from center) near the end of a game.
* Movement of the ball and scoring: four downs are allowed to advance the ball ten yards for a first down, or to score. Six points for a touchdown. One point for a conversion by place kick after a touchdown, two points for a conversion by drop kick and two points for successful run or pass after a touchdown. Three points for a field goal by placement or four points for a field goal by drop kick. Two points for a safety.
* Kicking: kickoffs are from the goal line, to begin the halves and odd overtimes, or after any score except a safety, in which a free kick is from the 5-yard line. Kickers may use a one-inch tee. All kicks must be made by either [[place kick]] or [[drop kick]]; punting is prohibited. The receiving team may field any kick that rebounds off the net and lands in the field of play. Any kickoff that goes out of bounds untouched or hits an overhead structure is be placed at the 20-yard line or the place where it went out of bounds, whichever is more advantageous to the receiving team. If a kickoff goes beyond the end zone and stays in bounds (such as kicking it into the field goal "slack net" or if the ball goes under the net), the ball will come out to the five-yard line. The [[touchback]] is not automatic; players must attempt to advance the ball out of their own end zone if it is caught there. The same is true if a missed field goal attempt goes beyond the end zone and under the net. If the receiving player chooses not to take the ball out of the endzone (takes a knee) or is tackled in the endzone, the ball is placed on the 2½-yard line. Any field goal or extra point attempted by drop kick is worth one additional point (thus four points for a drop-kicked field goal or two for [[two-point conversion|drop-kicked conversion]]). 
* Passing: passing rules in arena football are the same as outdoor [[NCAA football]] in which receivers must have one foot inbounds. A unique exception involves the rebound nets. A forward pass that rebounds off of the endzone net is a live ball and is in play until it touches the playing surface.
* Overtime: overtime periods are 15 minutes during the regular season and the playoffs (teams get three timeouts per two OT periods). In the first overtime each team gets one possession to score. Whoever is ahead after one possession wins. If the teams are tied after each has had a possession, whoever scores next wins. Multiple overtimes will be played beyond the first overtime in case of a tie and play continues in true [[sudden death (sports)|sudden death]] thereafter.

==Growth of the league==

===Expanding the season===
The practice of playing one or two preseason [[exhibition game]]s by each team before the start of the regular season was discontinued when the NBC contract was initiated, and the regular season was extended from 14 games, the length that it had been since 1996, to 16 from 2001 to 2010, and again as of 2016. From 2011 to 2015, the regular season league expanded to 18 games, with each team having two bye weeks and the option of two preseason games.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/news/index.html?article_id=292 |title=AFL Moves To 18-Game Regular Season Schedule For 2011 |date=2010-08-30 |work=Arena Football League |accessdate=2010-09-01| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100905054805/http://www.arenafootball.com/news/index.html?article_id=292| archivedate=2010-09-05 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===China Arena Football League and AFL Global===
[[File:AFL Global Logo.png|thumb|The AFL Global logo]]
{{main|China Arena Football League}}
In August 2012, the AFL announced a new project into China, known as the [[China Arena Football League]]. The CAFL project is headed up by [[ESPN]] NFL analyst and [[Philadelphia Soul]] majority owner president [[Ron Jaworski]]. The original plans were to establish a six-team league that would play a 10-week schedule that was slated to start in October 2014. The AFL coaches and trainers would travel to China to help teach the rules of the sport to squads made up of Chinese and American players with the goal of starting an official Chinese arena league.<ref>[http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/08/28/pro-football-is-heading-to-china/ Pro football is heading to China], Mike Florio, NBCSports.com,  August 28, 2012</ref> Ganlan Media International were given exclusive rights to the new Chinese league.<ref>[http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2012/08/30/487936/10003678/en/Ganlan-Media-International-Receives-Exclusive-Rights-to-Establish-Professional-American-Arena-Football-League-in-China.html Ganlan Media International Receives Exclusive Rights to Establish Professional American Arena Football League in China], NASDAQ XMO GlobeNewswire, August 30, 2012</ref> Following delays, the league is set to start its first full season in October 2016.<ref name="A">{{cite web | url=http://www.americanfootballinternational.com/china-arena-football-league-announces-2016-schedule/ | title=China Arena Football League Announces 2016 Schedule | publisher=americanfootballinternational.com | date=May 5, 2016 | accessdate=May 5, 2016 | author=Tilley, Lou}}</ref>

==Hall of Fame==
{{main|Arena Football Hall of Fame}}
The AFL has its own Hall of Fame consisting of players, coaches, and contributes who have significantly impacted the league. This hall is entirely different from the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] and solely exists to honor various AFL affiliates. This is the highest honor for any personnel in the AFL.

==Media==

===Television===
{{Main|AFL on TNN|AFL on FSN|AFL on NBC|Arena Football League on ESPN|Arena Football on CBS|List of ArenaBowl broadcasters}}

====2000s====
Beginning with the [[2003 Arena Football League season|2003 season]], the AFL made a deal with NBC to televise league games, which was renewed for another two years in [[2005 Arena Football League season|2005]]. In conjunction with this, the league moved the beginning of the season from May to February (the week after the NFL's [[Super Bowl]]) and scheduled most of its games on Sunday instead of Friday or Saturday as it had in the past. In [[2006 Arena Football League season|2006]], because of the [[2006 Winter Olympics|XX Winter Olympic Games]], the [[2006 Stanley Cup playoffs|Stanley Cup]] playoffs and the [[2006 Daytona 500|Daytona 500]], NBC scaled back from weekly coverage to scattered coverage during the regular season, but committed to a full playoff schedule ending with the [[ArenaBowl XX|20th ArenaBowl]]. NBC and the Arena Football League officially severed ties on June 30, 2006, having failed to reach a new broadcast deal. [[Cleveland Gladiators|Las Vegas]] owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the reason why a deal failed is because ESPN refused to show highlights or even mention a product being broadcast on NBC.

For the 2006 season only, the AFL added a national cable deal with OLN (now [[NBC Sports Network]]) for eleven regular-season games and one playoff game.

On December 19, 2006, ESPN announced the purchase of a minority stake in the AFL. This deal included television rights for the ESPN family of networks. ESPN would televise a minimum of 17 regular season games, most on Monday nights, and nine playoff games, including [[ArenaBowl XXI]] on [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3500&ATCLID=727455&SPID=1563 |title=AFL, ESPN enter into five-year agreement |work=ArenaFootball.com}}</ref> The deal resulted in added exposure on ESPN's ''[[SportsCenter]]''. However, after the original AFL filed for bankruptcy, this arrangement did not carry over to the new AFL, which is a separate legal entity.

The AFL also had a regional-cable deal with [[Fox Sports Net|FSN]], where FSN regional affiliates in AFL markets carried local team games. In some areas, such as with the [[Arizona Rattlers]], Fox Sports affiliates still carry the games.

====2010s====
After its return in [[2010 Arena Football League season|2010]], the AFL had its national television deal with the [[NFL Network]] for a weekly Friday night game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lombardo |first=John |url=http://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/article/64774 |title=NFL Network to broadcast new arena league's games |publisher=Sportsbusinessjournal.com |date=2010-02-08 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://arenafootball.com/news/index.html?article_id=49 |title=NFL Network Names Announcers For Arena Football League Debut |work=Arena Football League |date=March 29, 2010 |accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> All AFL games not on the NFL Network could be seen for free online, provided by [[Ustream]].<ref>[http://arenafootball.com.ismmedia.com/ISM3/std-content/repos/Top/News%20PDFs/NFL%20Network%20Schedule%20Release%20Web.pdf NFL Network Schedule News Release]</ref>

The NFL Network ceased airing live Arena Football League games partway through the [[2012 Arena Football League season|2012 season]] as a result of ongoing labor problems within the league. Briefly, the games were broadcast on a [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] to prevent the embarrassment that would result should the players stage a [[strike action|work stoppage]] immediately prior to a scheduled broadcast.  (In at least once incidence this actually happened, resulting in a non-competitive game being played with replacement players, and further such incidents were threatened.)  Once the labor issues were resolved, the NFL Network resumed the practice of broadcasting a live Friday night game. NFL Network dropped the league at the end of the 2012 season.

For the [[2013 Arena Football League season|2013 season]], the league's new national broadcast partner was the [[CBS Sports Network]]. CBSSN would air 19 regular season games<ref>{{cite news |title=CBS Sports Net to air Arena Football League |author=McMillan, Ken |url=http://blogs.hudsonvalley.com/hudson-valley-sports-tv/2013/02/14/cbs-sports-net-to-air-arena-football-league/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+hudson-valley-sports-tv+%28Coming+to+you+from+WKEN%3A+Sports+Television+and+Radio+Happenings%29 |newspaper= |date=14 February 2013 |accessdate=24 February 2013}}</ref> and two playoff games. [[CBS]] would also air the [[ArenaBowl]], marking the first time since 2008 that the league's finale aired on network television.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arena Football League moving to CBS Sports Network cable channel in 2013|date=November 13, 2012|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=[[Yahoo!]]|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/news/arena-league-moving-cbs-sports-201726835.html}}</ref> Regular season CBSSN broadcast games are usually on Saturday nights. As the games are being shown live, the start times are not uniform as with most football broadcast packages, but vary with the time zone in which the home team is located. This means that the AFL may appear either prior to or following the CBSSN's featured [[Major League Lacrosse]] game.

Starting in 2014, ESPN returned to the AFL as broadcast partners, with weekly games being shown on [[CBS Sports Network]], [[ESPN]], [[ESPN2]], [[ESPNEWS]] along with all games being broadcast on [[ESPN3]] for free live on [[WatchESPN]]. [[ArenaBowl XXVII]] was also broadcast on ESPN. Most teams also have a local TV station broadcast their games locally and all games are available on local radio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/soul/Leaked_document_reveals_ESPN_as_new_television_partner_for_Arena_Football_League.html |title=Leaked document reveals ESPN as new national television partner for Arena Football League |date=December 3, 2013 |author=Vaughn Johnson |publisher=Interstate General Media, LLC |work=www.philly.com |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.arenafootball.com/sports/a-footbl/spec-rel/121713aaa.html ESPN Acquires Rights to Arena Football Starting in 2014], ArenaFootball.com, December 17, 2013</ref>

===Video games===
{{main|Chronology of indoor American football video games}}

On May 18, 2000, ''[[Kurt Warner's Arena Football Unleashed]]'' was released by [[Midway Games]] for the [[PlayStation]] game console. On February 7, 2006 [[EA Sports]] released ''[[Arena Football (video game)|Arena Football]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. EA Sports released another AFL video game, titled ''[[Arena Football: Road to Glory]]'', on February 21, 2007, for the PlayStation 2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arenafootball.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=3500&ATCLID=727047&SPID=1548 |title=Arena Football: Road to Glory |work=ArenaFootball.com}}</ref>

===Literature===
In 2001, Jeff Foley published ''War on the Floor: An Average Guy Plays in the Arena Football League and Lives to Write About It''. The book details a journalist's two preseasons (1999 and 2000) as an offensive specialist/writer with the now-defunct [[Indiana Firebirds|Albany Firebirds]]. The 5-foot-6 (170&nbsp;cm), self-described "unathletic writer" played in three preseason games and had one catch for −2 yards.

==League finances==
The AFL currently runs as under the single-entity model, with the league owning the rights to the teams, players, and coaches.<ref name=structure>{{cite web |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=407&articleid=20090927_223_B1_Howcan164403 |title=Caution is new league's strength |last=Brown |first=Mike |work=Tulsa World |date=September 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20091002093753/http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=407&articleid=20090927_223_B1_Howcan164403| archivedate= 2 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The single-entity model was adopted in 2010 when the league emerged from bankruptcy. Prior to that, the league followed the [[North American professional sports league organization|franchise]] model more common in North American professional sports leagues; each team essentially operated as its own business and the league itself was a separate entity which in exchange for franchise fees paid by the team owners provided rules, officials, scheduling and the other elements of organizational structure.<ref name=barnstormers /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/article.aspx?subjectid=407&articleid=20110330_223_B2_TulsaT505747 |title=Co-owner: Talons couldn't keep vets |publisher=Tulsa World |date=2011-03-30 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> A pool of money is allotted to teams to aid in travel costs.<ref name=travel>{{cite web |url=http://www.themonitor.com/sports/new-31038-costs-rgv.html |title=Travel costs, geography keeps RGV from new league |last=Sandalow |first=Brian |work=The Monitor |date=September 27, 2009 |accessdate=September 29, 2009}}</ref>

Average attendance for AFL games were around 10,000–11,000 per game in the 1990s, though during the recession connected to the dot-com bubble and the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] average attendance dropped below 10,000 for several years. From the start of the 2004 season until the final season of the original league in 2008, average attendance was above 12,000, with 12,392 in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arenafan.com/statistics/?page=attendance&league=1 |title=ArenaFan Online : AFL Attendance |publisher=Arenafan.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-04}}</ref> Eleven of the seventeen teams in operation in 2007 had average attendance figures over 13,000.
