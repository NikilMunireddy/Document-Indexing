'''Hebrew Bible''' or '''Hebrew Scriptures''' ({{lang-la|Biblia Hebraica}}) is the term used by [[biblical scholars]] to refer to the ''[[Tanakh]]'' ({{lang-he|תנ"ך}}), the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the textual source of the several [[Development of the Old Testament canon|canonical editions]] of the [[Christian]] [[Old Testament]].  They are composed mainly in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with some passages in [[Biblical Aramaic]] (in the books of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]], [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] and a few others).

The content to which the Protestant [[Old Testament]] closely corresponds does not act as a source for the [[deuterocanonical]] portions of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] or to the ''{{transl|el|[[Anagignoskomena]]}}'' portions of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Old Testaments. The term does not comment upon the naming, numbering or ordering of books, which varies with later [[Christian biblical canons]].

The term Hebrew Bible is an attempt to provide specificity with respect to contents but avoid allusion to any particular interpretative tradition or theological school of thought. It is widely used in academic writing and [[interfaith]] discussion in relatively neutral contexts meant to include dialogue among all religious traditions but not widely in the inner discourse of the religions that use its text.<ref>Eliezer Segal, Introducing Judaism (New York, NY: Routledge, 2009).

==Usage==
Hebrew Bible refers to the [[Biblical canon#Jewish canons|Jewish biblical canon]]. In its [[Latin]] form, ''Biblia Hebraica'', it traditionally serves as a title for printed editions of the [[Masoretic Text]]. Many [[biblical studies]] scholars advocate use of the term "Hebrew Bible" (or "Hebrew Scriptures") as a neutral substitute to terms with religious connotations (e.g.,  the non-neutral term "Old Testament").<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9404E3D8153BF936A15756C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | title = The New Old Testament | first = William | last = Safire | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 1997-05-25 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Hebrew Bible [and] Old Testament" without prescribing the use of either.<ref>{{cite book|title=The SBL Handbook of Style |publisher=Hendrickson |location=Peabody, MA |year=1999 |editor1-first=Patrick H |editor1-last=Alexander |isbn=1-56563-487-X |page=17 (section 4.3) |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/SBLHS.pdf |format=PDF |display-editors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20071202123602/http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/SBLHS.pdf |archivedate=December 2, 2007 }} See [https://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/SBLHS2_FAQ.pdf ''Society of Biblical Literature'': Questions Regarding Digital Editions…]</ref>

===Additional difficulties===
In terms of theology, Christianity has struggled with the relationship between "Old" and "New" Testaments from its very beginnings.<ref name = "marcion_britannica">{{citation | contribution = Marcion | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | year = 1911 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. -->{{inconsistent citations}}}}.</ref><ref>For the recorded teachings of Jesus on the subject see [[Antithesis of the Law#Antitheses]], for the modern debate, see [[Christian views on the old covenant]]</ref> Modern Christian formulations of this tension include [[Supersessionism]], [[Covenant Theology]], [[New Covenant Theology]], [[Dispensationalism]] and [[Dual-covenant theology]]. All of these formulations, except some forms of Dual-covenant theology, are objectionable to mainstream Judaism and to many Jewish scholars and writers, for whom there is one eternal [[Covenant (religion)|covenant]] between God and the [[Israelites]], and who therefore reject the term "Old Testament" as a form of [[antinomianism]].

In terms of [[Development of the Christian Biblical canon|canon]], Christian usage of "Old Testament" does not refer to a universally agreed upon set of books but, rather, [[Canon of the Old Testament|varies depending on denomination]]. [[Luther's canon|Lutheranism]] and Protestant denominations that follow the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] accept the entire Jewish canon as the Old Testament without additions, however in translation they sometimes give preference to the [[Septuagint]] rather than the Masoretic Text; for example, see [[Isaiah 7:14]].

In terms of language, "Hebrew" refers to the original language of the books, but it may also be taken as referring to the Jews of the [[Second Temple]] era and [[Jewish diaspora]], and their descendants, who preserved the transmission of the Masoretic Text up to the present day. The Hebrew Bible includes small portions in [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] (mostly in the books of [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] and [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]]), written and printed in [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic square-script]], which was adopted as the [[Hebrew alphabet]] after the [[Babylonian exile]].

==Origins of the Hebrew Bible and its components==
{{main|Dating the Bible|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon}}
The books that constitute the Hebrew Bible developed over roughly a millennium. The oldest texts seem to come from the eleventh or tenth centuries BCE, whilst most of the other texts are somewhat later. They are edited works, being collections of various sources intricately and carefully woven together. {{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Since the nineteenth century, most scholars have agreed that the Pentateuch (the first five books of Scriptures) consists of four sources which have been woven together. These four sources are J (Yahwist), D (Deuteronomist), E (Elohist) and P (Priestly) sources. They were combined to form the Pentateuch sometime in the sixth century BCE. This theory is now known as the  [[documentary hypothesis]], and has been the dominant theory for the past two hundred years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/first/scriptures.html |first=Mark |last=Hamilton |title=From Hebrew Bible to Christian Bible: Jews, Christians and the Word of God |work=Frontline |series=From Jesus to Christ |date=April 1998 |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation}}</ref> The [[Deuteronomist]] credited with the Pentateuch's book of Deuteronomy is also said to be the source of the books of  [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[Books of Samuel|Samuel]], and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] (the Deuteronomistic history, or DtrH) and also in the [[book of Jeremiah]].
