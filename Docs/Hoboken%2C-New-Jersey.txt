Hoboken was first settled as part of the [[Pavonia, New Netherland]] colony in the 17th century. During the early 19th century the city was developed by [[John Stevens (inventor)|Colonel John Stevens]], first as a resort and later as a residential neighborhood. It became a township in 1849 and was incorporated as a city in 1855. Hoboken is the location of the first recorded game of [[baseball]] (although this is disputed) and of the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], one of the oldest technological universities in the United States.

Located on the [[Hudson Waterfront]], the city was an integral part of the [[Port of New York and New Jersey]] and home to major industries for most of the 20th century. It is also well known for being the birthplace and hometown of American singer [[Frank Sinatra]], one of the most popular and most influential musical acts of the 20th century, and there are parks and streets located in the city that are named for him. The character of the city has changed from a [[blue collar]] town to one of upscale shops and condominiums.<ref>Martin, Antoinette.

On October 29, 2012, Hoboken was devastated by the storm surge and high winds associated with [[Hurricane Sandy]], leaving 1,700 homes flooded and causing $100 million in damage after the storm "filled up Hoboken like a bathtub". In June 2014, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] allocated $230 million as part of its Rebuild by Design initiative, with levees, parks, green roofs, retention basins and other infrastructure added to help the low-lying riverfront city survive storms that arrive once every 500 years.<ref>Jaffe, Eric.

Sandy flooded more than 1,700 Hoboken homes, knocked out the city's power grid, and halted trains into New York; in total, the storm caused more than $100 million in damages."</ref>

==History==

===Etymology===
The name "Hoboken" was chosen by Colonel [[John Stevens (inventor)|John Stevens]] when he bought land, on a part of which the city still sits. The [[Lenape]] (later called Delaware Indian) tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] referred to the area as the "land of the tobacco pipe", most likely to refer to the [[soapstone]] collected there to carve [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|tobacco pipe]]s, and used a phrase that became "Hopoghan Hackingh".<ref>[https://www.hobokenmuseum.org/history/short-history-of-hoboken HM-hist "The Abridged History of Hoboken"], Hoboken Museum, Accessed February 24, 2015.</ref><ref>Hutchinson, Viola L.

===Early and colonial===
[[Image:HudsonRiverJerseyCity1890.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Hudson River]] during the 1880s, offshore from Hoboken and [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]]]]
Hoboken was originally an island, surrounded by the [[Hudson River]] on the east and tidal lands at the foot of the [[New Jersey Palisades]] on the west. It was a seasonal campsite in the territory of the [[Hackensack (Native Americans)|Hackensack]], a [[phratry]] of the [[Lenape|Lenni Lenape]], who used the serpentine rock found there to carve pipes. The first recorded European to lay claim to the area was [[Henry Hudson]], an Englishman sailing for the [[Dutch East India Company]], who anchored his ship the ''[[Halve Maen]]'' (''Half Moon'') at [[Weehawken Cove]] on October 2, 1609.<ref name="Hoboken Museum">[https://www.hobokenmuseum.org/history/short-history-of-hoboken Short History of Hoboken], Hoboken Historical Museum. Accessed September 1, 2015.</ref> Soon after it became part of the province of [[New Netherland]]. In 1630, [[w:Michael Reyniersz Pauw|Michael Pauw]], a burgemeester (mayor) of [[Amsterdam]] and a director of the [[Dutch West India Company]], received a land grant as [[patroon]] on the condition that he would plant a colony of not fewer than fifty persons within four years on the west bank of what had been named the [[North River (New York-New Jersey)|North River]]. Three [[Lenape]] sold the land that was to become Hoboken (and part of Jersey City) for 80 fathoms (146 m) of [[wampum]], 20 fathoms (37 m) of cloth, 12 kettles, six guns, two blankets, one double kettle and half a barrel of beer.<ref name="Hoboken Museum"/> These transactions, variously dated as July 12, 1630 and November 22, 1630, represent the earliest known conveyance for the area. Pauw (whose Latinized name is [[Pavonia, New Netherland|Pavonia]]) failed to settle the land and he was obliged to sell his holdings back to the Company in 1633. It was later acquired by [[Hendrick Van Vorst]], who leased part of the land to [[Aert Van Putten]], a farmer. In 1643, north of what would be later known as Castle Point, Van Putten built a house and a brewery, North America's first. In series of Indian and Dutch raids and reprisals, Van Putten was killed and his buildings destroyed, and all residents of Pavonia (as the colony was known) were ordered back to New Amsterdam. Deteriorating relations with the Lenape, its isolation as an island, or relatively long distance from New Amsterdam may have discouraged more settlement. In 1664, the English took possession of [[New Amsterdam]] with little or no resistance, and in 1668 they confirmed a previous land patent by Nicolas Verlett. In 1674–75 the area became part of [[East Jersey]], and the province was divided into four administrative districts, Hoboken becoming part of [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen County]], where it remained until the creation of [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] on February 22, 1840. English-speaking settlers (some relocating from New England) interspersed with the Dutch, but it remained scarcely populated and agrarian. Eventually, the land came into the possession of William Bayard, who originally supported the revolutionary cause, but became a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist Tory]] after the fall of New York in 1776 when the city and surrounding areas, including the west bank of the renamed Hudson River, were occupied by the British. At the end of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Bayard's property was confiscated by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey. In 1784, the land described as "William Bayard's farm at Hoebuck" was bought at auction by Colonel [[John Stevens (inventor)|John Stevens]] for £18,360 (then $90,000).<ref name="Hoboken Museum"/>

In the early 19th century, Colonel [[John Stevens (inventor)|John Stevens]] developed the waterfront as a resort for Manhattanites. On October 11, 1811, Stevens' ship the ''Juliana'', began to operate as a [[ferry]] between Manhattan and Hoboken, making it the world's first commercial steam ferry.<ref>[http://www.stevens.edu/sit/about/steamboats.cfm "History: Steamboats"], Stevens Institute of Technology.

When the ''Juliana'' was put into service from Hoboken to New York, the Stevenses inaugurated what is reputed to be the first regular commercially operated steam ferry in the world."</ref> In 1825, he designed and built a [[steam locomotive]] capable of hauling several passenger cars at his estate.

Hoboken was originally formed as a [[township (New Jersey)|township]] on April 9, 1849, from portions of [[North Bergen, New Jersey|North Bergen Township]]. As the town grew in population and employment, many of Hoboken's residents saw a need to incorporate as a full-fledged city, and in a referendum held on March 29, 1855, ratified an Act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] signed the previous day, and the City of Hoboken was born.<ref name=Story/> In the subsequent election, Cornelius V.

By the 1850s, several [[Manhattan]]-based members of the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] were using the grounds as their home field while St. George's continued to organize international matches between Canada, England and the United States at the same venue. In 1859, [[George Parr (cricketer)|George Parr]]'s All England Eleven of professional cricketers played the United States XXII at Hoboken, easily defeating the local competition. Sam Wright and his sons Harry and George Wright played on the defeated United States team—a loss which inadvertently encouraged local players to take up baseball. Henry Chadwick believed that baseball and not cricket should become the national pastime after the game drawing the conclusion that amateur American players did not have the leisure time required to develop cricket skills to the high technical level required of professional players. [[Harry Wright]] and [[George Wright (sportsman)|George Wright]] then became two of the first professional baseball players in the United States when Aaron Champion raised funds to found the [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] in 1869.

In 1865 the grounds hosted a championship match between the [[New York Mutuals|Mutual Club]] of New York City and the [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantic Club]] of [[Brooklyn]] that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the [[Currier & Ives]] [[lithograph]] "The American National Game of Base Ball".<ref>[http://www.loc.gov/resource/pga.00600/ "The American national game of base ball.

With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in [[Brooklyn]], enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence of [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Fields]] diminished.  In 1868 the leading [[Manhattan]] club, [[New York Mutuals|Mutual]], shifted its home games to the [[Union Grounds]] in Brooklyn.  In 1880, the founders of the [[New York Metropolitans]] and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as the [[Polo Grounds]].

Pershing's promise to the troops that they'd be in 'Heaven, Hell or Hoboken' by Christmas of 1917 became a national rallying cry for a swift end to the war, which actually dragged on for another year."</ref>

Following the war, [[Italians]], mostly stemming from the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] port city of [[Molfetta]], became the city's major ethnic group, with the [[Irish ethnicity|Irish]] also having a strong presence.<ref>Baldwin, Carly. [http://www.nj.com/hobokennow/index.ssf/2009/09/2009_hoboken_italian_festival.html "2009 Hoboken Italian Festival begins tomorrow!"], [[NJ.com]], September 9, 2009. Accessed September 1, 2015.

Later generations would later emigrate from Molfetta and the surrounding region to Hoboken, where the centuries-old tradition continues."</ref> While the city experienced the [[Great Depression]], jobs in the ships yards and factories were still available, and the tenements were full. Middle-European Jews, mostly German-speaking, also made their way to the city and established small businesses. The [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], which was established on April 30, 1921, oversaw the development of the [[Holland Tunnel]] (completed in 1927) and the [[Lincoln Tunnel]] (in 1937), allowing for easier vehicular travel between New Jersey and New York City, bypassing the waterfront.

===Post-World War II===
The war facilitated economic growth in Hoboken, as the many industries located in the city were crucial to the war effort. As men went off to battle, more women were hired in the factories, some (most notably, [[Todd Shipyards]]), offering classes and other incentives to them. Though some returning service men took advantage of GI housing bills, many with strong ethnic and familial ties chose to stay in town. During the fifties, the economy was still driven by Todd Shipyards, [[Maxwell House]],<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Talk of the Town: Good to the Last Drop | work = [[The New Yorker]] | date = November 20, 1989 | url = http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1989-11-20#folio=044 | doi = | accessdate = February 14, 2011}}</ref> [[Lipton Tea]], [[Hostess (brand)|Hostess]] and [[Bethlehem Steel]] and companies with big plants were still not inclined to invest in huge infrastructure elsewhere. Unions were powerful and the pay was good.

By the 1960s, though, things began to deteriorate: turn-of-the century housing started to look shabby and feel crowded, shipbuilding was cheaper overseas, and single-story plants surrounded by parking lots made manufacturing and distribution more economical than old brick buildings on congested urban streets. The city appeared to be in the throes of inexorable decline as industries sought (what had been) greener pastures, port operations shifted to larger facilities on [[Newark Bay]], and the car, truck and plane displaced the railroad and ship as the transportation modes of choice in the United States. Many Hobokenites headed to the suburbs, often the close-by ones in [[Bergen County, New Jersey|Bergen]] and [[Passaic County, New Jersey|Passaic]] Counties, and real-estate values declined. Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a rundown condition and was often included in lists with other New Jersey cities experiencing the same phenomenon, such as [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[Elizabeth, New Jersey|Elizabeth]], [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]], and neighboring [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]].

The old economic underpinnings were gone and nothing new seemed to be on the horizon. Attempts were made to stabilize the population by demolishing the so-called slums along River Street and build subsidized middle-income housing at Marineview Plaza, and in midtown, at Church Towers. Heaps of long uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were not uncommon sights.<ref>Martin, Antoinette.

"The area back from the Hudson River, along streets named for presidents -- Adams, Jackson, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe -- was ''sketchy'', Mr. Geibel said, and marked by ''old warehouses, boarded-up windows, raw sewage coming out of pipes and packs of wild dogs running in the streets.''"</ref> Though the city had seen better days, Hoboken was never abandoned. New infusions of immigrants, most notably [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Ricans]], kept the storefronts open with small businesses and housing stock from being abandoned, but there wasn't much work to be had. Washington Street, commonly called "the avenue", was never boarded up, and the tight-knit neighborhoods remained home to many who were still proud of their city. Stevens stayed a premiere technology school, Maxwell House kept chugging away, and Bethlehem Steel still housed sailors who were dry-docked on its piers. Italian-Americans and other came back to the "old neighborhood" to shop for delicatessen.

===Waterfront===
[[File:HobokenNJ Downtown.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Aerial view of Hoboken Terminal]]
The waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th to mid-20th century, by which time it had become essentially industrial (and mostly inaccessible to the general public). The large production plants of Lipton Tea and Maxwell House, and the [[drydock]]s of [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation]] dominated the northern portion for many years. On June 30, 1900, [[1900 Hoboken Docks Fire|a large fire]] at the [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] piers killed numerous people and caused almost $10 million in damage.<ref>Beitler, Stu.

With the development of the [[Interstate Highway System]] and [[containerization]] shipping facilities (particularly at [[Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal]]), the docks became obsolete, and by the 1970s were more or less abandoned.<ref name="Hoboken Museum"/> A large swath of River Street, known as the [[Barbary Coast]] for its taverns and boarding houses (which had been home for many dockworkers, sailors, merchant mariners, and other seamen) was leveled as part of an [[urban renewal]] project. Though control of the confiscated area had been returned to the city in the 1950s, complex lease agreements with the [[Port Authority]] gave it little influence on its management. In the 1980s, the waterfront dominated Hoboken politics, with various civic groups and the city government engaging in sometimes nasty, sometimes absurd politics and court cases. By the 1990s, agreements were made with the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]], various levels of government, Hoboken citizens, and private developers to build commercial and residential buildings and "open spaces" (mostly along the bulkhead and on the foundation of un-utilized [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey|Pier A]]).<ref>[http://www.panynj.gov/real-estate-development/south-waterfront-hoboken.html The South Waterfront at Hoboken ], [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]].

The promenade along the river bank is part of the [[Hudson River Waterfront Walkway]], a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the [[Bayonne Bridge]] to [[George Washington Bridge]] and provide contiguous unhindered access to the water's edge and to create an urban linear park offering expansive views of the Hudson with the spectacular backdrop of the New York skyline.

===1970s–present===
During the late 1970s and 1980s, the city witnessed a speculation spree, fueled by transplanted New Yorkers and others who bought many turn-of-the-20th-century brownstones in neighborhoods that the still solid middle and working class population had kept intact and by local and out-of-town real-estate investors who bought up late 19th century apartment houses often considered to be tenements.

Accessed February 1, 2012.</ref> Applied Housing, a real-estate investment firm, used federal government incentives to renovate "sub-standard" housing and receive subsidized rental payments (commonly known as [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]]), which enabled some low-income, displaced, and disabled residents to move within town. Hoboken attracted artists, musicians, upwardly mobile commuters (known as yuppies), and "bohemian types" interested in the socioeconomic possibilities and challenges of a bankrupt New York and who valued the aesthetics of Hoboken's residential, civic and commercial architecture, its sense of community, and relatively (compared to Lower Manhattan) cheaper rents, and quick, train hop away. [[Maxwell's]] (a live music venue and restaurant) opened and Hoboken became a "hip" place to live. Amid this social upheaval, so-called "newcomers" displaced some of the "old-timers" in the eastern half of the city.

This [[gentrification]] resembled that of parts of [[Brooklyn]] and downtown [[Jersey City, New Jersey|Jersey City]] and Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], (and to a lesser degree, [[SoHo]] and [[TriBeCa]], which previously had not been residential). The initial presence of artists and young people changed the perception of the place such that others who would not have considered moving there before perceived it as an interesting, safe, exciting, and eventually, desirable. The process continued as many suburbanites, transplanted Americans, internationals, and immigrants (most focused on opportunities in NY/NJ region and proximity to Manhattan) began to make the "Jersey" side of the Hudson their home, and the "real-estate boom" of the era encouraged many to seek investment opportunities. Empty lots were built on, tenements became condominiums. Hoboken felt the impact of the destruction of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] intensely, many of its newer residents having worked there. Re-zoning encouraged new construction on former industrial sites on the waterfront and the traditionally more impoverished low-lying west side of the city where, in concert with Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and New Jersey State land-use policy, [[transit village]]s<ref>[http://policy.rutgers.edu/vtc/reports/REPORTS/HBLR%20Final%20Report.pdf Land Development at Selected Hudson-Bergen Light Rail Stations]</ref> are now being promoted.

The four parks were originally laid out within city street grid in the 19th century were [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Church Square Park|Church Square Park]], [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Columbus Park|Columbus Park]], [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Park]] and [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Stevens Park|Stevens Park]].

The [[Hudson River Waterfront Walkway]] is a state-mandated master plan to connect the municipalities from the [[Bayonne Bridge]] to the [[George Washington Bridge]] creating an {{convert|18|mi|km|sing=on}}-long urban linear park and provide contiguous unhindered access to the water's edge. By law, any development on the waterfront must provide a public promenade with a minimum width of {{convert|30|ft|m}}. To date, completed segments in Hoboken and the new parks and renovated piers that abut them are at [[Hoboken Terminal]], [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Pier A|Pier A]], the promenade and bike path from Newark to 5th Streets, [[Frank Sinatra Park]], [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Castle Point Park|Castle Point Park]], Sinatra Drive to 12th to 14th Streets, New York Waterway Pier, 14th Street Pier, and 14th Street north to southern side of Weehawken Cove. Other segments of river-front held privately are not required to build a walkway until the land is re-developed.

The [[Hoboken Parks Initiative]] is a municipal plan to create more public open spaces in the city using a variety of financing schemes including contributions from and zoning trade-offs with private developers, New Jersey State [[Green Acres]] funds, and other government grants. It is source of controversy with various civic groups and the city government. Among the proposed projects, the only one to that has yet materialized is at Maxwell Place, whose developer is obligated to build a public promenade on the river. The parks that are planned to be built are [[Landmarks of Hoboken, New Jersey#Hoboken Island|Hoboken Island]], Pier C, 1600 Park Avenue, [[Weehawken Cove|Hoboken Cove]], 16th Street Pier, Green Belt Walkway and Upper West Side Park.
