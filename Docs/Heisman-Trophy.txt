The '''Heisman Memorial Trophy Award''' (usually known colloquially as the '''Heisman Trophy''' or '''The Heisman'''), is awarded annually to the most outstanding player in [[college football]] in the [[United States]] whose performance best exhibits the pursuit of excellence with integrity. Winners epitomize great ability combined with diligence, perseverance, and hard work. It is presented by the Heisman Trophy Trust in early December before the postseason [[bowl games]].

The award was created in 1935 for the "most valuable football player in the East" by the [[Downtown Athletic Club]].<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news |title=Gridiron Scene for Trophy |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 14, 1935 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30B17F63C5B1B7B93C6A8178AD95F418385F9 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref>  After the death of the Club's athletic director, [[John Heisman]], the award was named in his honor and broadened to include players west of the Mississippi.<ref name="NYTimes3">{{cite news |title=Heisman Trophy Awarded Kelley|newspaper=New York Times |date=December 2, 1936 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0614FE345D1B7B93C0A91789D95F428385F9 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>  Heisman had been active in college athletics as a football player; a head football, basketball, and baseball coach; and an athletic director. It is the oldest of several overall awards in college football, including the [[Maxwell Award]], [[Walter Camp Award]], and the [[Associated Press College Football Player of the Year Award|AP Player of the Year]]. The Heisman and the AP Player of the Year honor the ''most outstanding player'', while the Maxwell and the Walter Camp award recognizes the ''best player'', and the [[Archie Griffin Award]] recognizes the ''most valuable player''. The most recent winner of the Heisman Trophy is  University of Alabama running back [[Derrick Henry]].

==Trophy design==
The trophy itself, designed by sculptor [[Frank Eliscu]], is modeled after [[Ed Smith (football player)|Ed Smith]], a leading player in 1934 for the now-defunct [[New York University]] football team.<ref name="info">{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3145185 |title=From the legendary to the little-known, Heisman history is never dull |publisher=ESPN |author=John D. Lukacs |date=2007-12-07 |accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref> The trophy is made out of cast [[bronze]], is 13.5&nbsp;inches (34.3&nbsp;cm) tall and weighs 25 pounds (11.3&nbsp;kg).<ref name="info" />

Eliscu had asked Smith, his former George Washington High School classmate, to pose for a commissioned sculpture of a football player.  Smith did not realize until 1982 that the sculpture had become the Heisman Trophy.  The Downtown Athletic Club presented Smith with a Heisman Trophy of his own in 1985.

From its inception in 1935, the statue was cast by [[Dieges & Clust]] in New York (and later Providence, Rhode Island) until 1980, when Dieges and Clust was sold to [[Herff Jones]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} For a time until at least 2008, the statues were cast by [[Roman Bronze Works]] in New York.<ref name="foundry">{{cite news |title=Winning One Heisman Is Tough Enough, And Tebow Has His|first=Joey|last=Johnston |newspaper=Tampa Tribune |date=December 14, 2008 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>

==Selection==
Originally only players east of the Mississippi were eligible, but since 1936 all football players in all divisions of college football are eligible for the award, though winners usually represent Division I [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] schools.<ref name="NYTimes2">{{cite news |title=Berwanger Gains Trophy |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 5, 1935 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB061EF93D58107A93C7A91789D95F418385F9 |accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref>

There are three categories of persons eligible to vote for the award winner:
* Sports journalists: Heisman.com states that sports journalists are to be the determinants of the award since they are "informed, competent, and impartial."<ref name=balloting>{{cite web|title=Heisman Trophy Balloting|publisher=heisman.com|url=http://www.heisman.com/history/balloting.php|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69yAy4nuI|archivedate=August 16, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> There are 870 media voters: 145 voters from each of six regions.
* Previous Heisman winners (and in cases where an underclassman wins the award and remains in school to play, a prior winner may also be a current candidate). According to Heisman.com there are currently 57 prior winners eligible to vote<ref name=balloting/> and, thus, 57 potential votes (a prior winner is not required to vote and does not lose his voting privileges by not voting).
* Fans: As the Premier Partner of the Heisman Trophy Nissan has a vote and gives this to the fans. Fan voting done through a survey collected by ESPN on NissanHeismanHouse.com. This constitutes one Heisman vote.

Each voter identifies three selections, ranking them in order.  Each first-place selection is awarded three points. Each second-place selection is awarded two points. Each third-place selection is awarded one point.  Voters must make three selections and cannot duplicate a selection, else the ballot is invalid and none of the selections count.<ref name=balloting/>

The accounting firm [[Deloitte]] is responsible for the tabulation of votes, which has moved almost exclusively to online voting since 2007.<ref name=balloting/>

==Notable achievements==
*[[Larry Kelley]] and [[Clint Frank]] of [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale]] were the first teammates to win the Heisman Trophy, in 1936 and 1937.
*[[Nile Kinnick]] of [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]] was the only Heisman Trophy winner (1939) to have a stadium named after him. In 1972, the [[University of Iowa]] renamed its football complex [[Kinnick Stadium]].  Nile Kinnick is also the only winner to lose his life in military service of the United States.  He went down piloting an F4F Wildcat from the deck of USS Lexington (CV-16).
*[[Doc Blanchard]] was the first junior to win the Heisman Trophy when he led [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] to the national title in 1945.
*[[Paul Hornung]] was the only player to win the Heisman Trophy as a player for a losing team. He took the award at [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] 1956, when the Irish finished a dismal 2–8 on the year.
*[[Ernie Davis]] was the first African American player to win the Heisman Trophy.  He attended [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse University]] and was the overall first round draft pick in 1962, yet never played a game in the NFL as he was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] and died in 1963.
*[[Terry Baker]] was the only player to win the Heisman Trophy and play in the [[Final Four (college basketball)|Final Four]] in the NCAA Basketball Tournament in the same school year (1962–63).
*[[Archie Griffin]] of [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] is the only player to receive the award twice, winning it as a [[Student#Post-second year|junior]] in 1974 and a senior in 1975.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heisman.com/winners/a-griffin74.php |title=1974 & 1975 – 40th & 41st Awards |publisher=Heisman.com |accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref>
*[[Steve Spurrier]], the 1966 recipient as a [[Florida Gators football|Florida Gator]], became the first Heisman Trophy winner to coach a winner in 1996 ([[Danny Wuerffel]], also of the University of Florida).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gatorzone.com/football/bios.php?year=2001&staff=spurrier |title=Florida Gators Football Head Coach Steve Spurrier |publisher=gatorzone.com |accessdate=2013-11-25}}</ref>
*[[Charles Woodson]] of the [[Michigan Wolverines football|University of Michigan]] is the only primarily defensive player to win the award, beating out favorite [[Peyton Manning]], quarterback for the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|University of Tennessee]], in 1997. He was a standout cornerback, but also occasionally played as a wide receiver and punt returner.
*In 2007, [[Tim Tebow]] was the first sophomore to win the Heisman.
*In 2012, [[Johnny Manziel]] became the first redshirt freshman to win the award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.khou.com/sports/Johnny-Heisman-Manziel-first-freshman-to-win-trophy-182692501.html|title='Johnny Heisman': Manziel first freshman to win trophy|publisher=[[KHOU]]|date=2012-12-08|accessdate=2012-12-08}}</ref>

Ohio State and Notre Dame have the most number of Heisman trophies won, each with seven; Ohio State has had six different players win the award.

The player who received the most votes (by percentage) was [[Reggie Bush]] of [[USC Trojans football|USC]] in 2005, though his award has since been vacated.<ref name=stiffarm>{{cite web|last=Chisholm|first=Kari|title=A plea to sportswriters for statistical accuracy|url=http://www.stiffarmtrophy.com/2011/12/08/plea-sportswriters-statistical-accuracy/|work=Stiff Arm Trophy|accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> The player who won by the widest margin was [[Troy Smith]] of [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] in 2006.<ref name=stiffarm /> The closest margin of votes was in 2009 between winner [[Mark Ingram, Jr.|Mark Ingram]] of [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] and [[Toby Gerhart]] of [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]].<ref name=stiffarm />

Eleven of the Heisman Trophy winners are in the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/story.jsp?story_id=1992 |title=Heisman Trophy winners in the HOF |publisher=profootballhof.com |accessdate=2008-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/heroes-of-the-game/years/ |title=Heroes of the Game |accessdate=2016-01-17}}</ref> and four winners have also been named Most Valuable Player in a [[Super Bowl]].<!-- [[Roger Staubach]], [[Jim Plunkett]], [[Marcus Allen]], and [[Desmond Howard]].--> Some winners have gone on to play in other professional sports, including [[Bo Jackson]] in baseball and [[Charlie Ward]] in basketball. [[Pete Dawkins]] and [[Dick Kazmaier]] are the only winners not to pursue a professional sports career:  Dawkins had a career with the [[United States Army]] where he achieved the rank of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]]; Kazmaier attended [[Harvard Business School]], founded a consulting company specializing in sports marketing, and chaired the [[President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition]] during 1988–89.

==University success==
In addition to personal statistics, team achievements play a heavy role in the voting – a typical Heisman winner represents a team that had an outstanding season and was most likely in contention for the [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championship]] or a major conference championship at some point in that season. Although the [[Chicago Maroons football|University of Chicago]] abandoned Division I football in 1939, and is now a [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] school, and [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale]] and [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]] are now Division I FCS, all three schools were considered major football programs at the time their players won the award.

The closest that a player outside the modern Division I FBS came to winning the Heisman is third place; in both cases, the players involved played for schools in what was at the time Division I-AA, now [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]]. The first was [[Gordon Lockbaum|Gordie Lockbaum]] from [[Holy Cross Crusaders football|Holy Cross]] in 1987, followed by [[Steve McNair]], from [[Alcorn State University|Alcorn State]] in 1993. [[Armanti Edwards]], from [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State University]], was also briefly mentioned as a candidate for the award following Appalachian's [[2007 Appalachian State vs. Michigan football game|upset]] of then #5-ranked Michigan in 2007.

Besides Griffin winning consecutive Heismans at Ohio State, three other programs had two different players win the Heisman Trophy in consecutive years: Yale (1936–37), [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] (1945–46), and [[USC Trojans football|Southern California (USC)]] (2004–05, though [[Reggie Bush]] voluntarily [[#Nullification of 2005 award|forfeited his 2005 award]] in September 2010 and sent the trophy back to the Heisman Trust<ref>{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Erick|title=Reggie Bush announces he is giving back his Heisman Trophy|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/campusrivalry/post/2010/09/reggie-bush-announces-he-is-returing-his-heisman-trophy/1|accessdate=September 14, 2010|newspaper=USA Today|date=September 14, 2010}}</ref>). With an earlier win in 2002, the USC program actually had three different winners within four years.

Only three high schools have produced multiple Heisman trophy winners. The first was [[Woodrow Wilson High School (Dallas, Texas)|Woodrow Wilson High School]] in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]] ([[Davey O'Brien]] in 1938 and [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]] in 1987) (Woodrow remains the only '''public''' high school to be so recognized). Thereafter, two private high schools also achieved this distinction:  [[Fork Union Military Academy]] in [[Fork Union, Virginia]] ([[Vinny Testaverde]] as a Postgraduate in 1982, and [[Eddie George]] in 1996) and [[Mater Dei High School (Santa Ana, California)|Mater Dei High School]] in [[Santa Ana, California]] ([[John Huarte]] in 1964 and [[Matt Leinart]] in 2004).

Of the colleges where trophy namesake [[John Heisman]] coached, only [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn University]] has produced Heisman winners, with [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in 1972, [[Bo Jackson]] in 1985, and [[Cam Newton]] in 2010.

==Class and age==
Until recently, most winners of the Heisman have been seniors.<ref>[http://www.heisman.com/index.php/heismanWinners#winners-year Heisman Winners<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Texas A&M quarterback [[Johnny Manziel]] became the first freshman to win the Heisman in 2012. The following year, at 19 years and 342 days old, Florida State quarterback [[Jameis Winston]] became the youngest Heisman Trophy winner as a freshman. No sophomore won the Heisman in its first 72 years, at which point there were three consecutive sophomore winners: [[Tim Tebow]] in 2007, followed by [[Sam Bradford]] and [[Mark Ingram, Jr.]] Only a few juniors have won the award, starting with the eleventh winner in 1945, [[Doc Blanchard]].

Five players have finished in the top three of the Heisman voting as freshmen or sophomores before later winning the award: [[Angelo Bertelli]], [[Glenn Davis (American football)|Glenn Davis]], [[Doc Blanchard]], [[Doak Walker]], and [[Herschel Walker]]. Six players have finished in the top three as freshmen or sophomores but never won a Heisman: [[Clint Castleberry]], [[Marshall Faulk]], [[Michael Vick]], [[Rex Grossman]], [[Larry Fitzgerald]], and [[Adrian Peterson]]. Four players have specifically finished second in consecutive years: Glenn Davis (second in 1944 and 1945, winner in 1946), Charlie Justice (second 1948 and 1949), [[Darren McFadden]] (second 2006 and 2007), and [[Andrew Luck]] (second 2010 and 2011).

The oldest and youngest Heisman winners ever both played for [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]]. The oldest, [[Chris Weinke]], was 28 years old when he won in 2000; he spent six years in [[minor league baseball]] before enrolling at FSU. The youngest winner is 2013 recipient [[Jameis Winston]], at the age of 19 years and 11 months.

==Position==
The Heisman is usually awarded to a [[running back]] or a [[quarterback]]; very few players have won the trophy playing at a different position. Two tight ends have won the trophy, [[Larry Kelley]] and [[Leon Hart]]. Also, [[Desmond Howard]] and [[Tim Brown (American football)|Tim Brown]] won as wide receivers. [[Charles Woodson]] is the only primarily [[Defense (sport)|defensive]] player to win the award, doing so as a [[defensive back]], kick returner, and occasional wide receiver for [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] in 1997. Legendary [[linebacker]] [[Dick Butkus]] only placed sixth in [[1963 college football season|1963]] and third in [[1964 college football season|1964]] and could qualify as an interior lineman, as he played center on offense during these two-way player days. The highest finish ever for any individual who played exclusively on defense is second, by defensive end [[Hugh Green (American football)|Hugh Green]] of [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] in 1980 and linebacker [[Manti Te'o]] of Notre Dame in 2012. No interior [[Lineman (American football)|lineman]] on either side of the ball has ever won the award, although the offensive guard [[Tom Brown (defensive lineman)|Tom Brown]] of [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota]] and the offensive tackle [[John Hicks (American football)|John Hicks]] of [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] placed second in 1960 and 1973, respectively. Rich Glover, a defensive lineman from Nebraska, finished 3rd in the 1972 vote—which was won by his Cornhusker teammate Johnny Rodgers. [[Washington Huskies football|Washington's]] DT [[Steve Emtman]] finished 4th in voting in 1991. [[Ndamukong Suh]] of [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] finished fourth in 2009 as a defensive tackle. Also, [[Kurt Burris]], a center for the [[Oklahoma Sooners football]] team, was a runner-up for the award in 1954 and [[Orlando Pace]] finished fourth in 1996 as an offensive tackle for [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]].{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}

==Venue==
Because of damage to the [[Downtown Athletic Club#September 11 and subsequent bankruptcy|Downtown Athletic Club]]'s facilities following [[September 11 attacks|9/11]], the award ceremony was moved to the [[New York Marriott Marquis]] in [[Times Square]]. After the DAC declared bankruptcy in 2002, the [[Yale Club of New York City|Yale Club]] hosted the presentation at its facility in 2002 and 2003. The ceremony moved to the [[Hilton New York]] for 2004 and has been presented annually at the [[PlayStation Theater]], formerly known as the Best Buy Theater and the Nokia Theatre Times Square, since 2005.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}

The 2008 Heisman press conference was held at the [[Sports Museum of America]] in New York. There was an entire gallery with the museum-attraction dedicated to the Trophy, including the making of the Trophy, the history of the DAC, and information on John Heisman and all the Trophy's winners. There was also a dedicated area celebrating the most recent winner, and the opportunity for visitors to cast their vote for next winner (with the top vote-winner receiving 1 official vote on their behalf). The Sports Museum of America closed permanently in February 2009.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}

==History==
[[Image:Rashaan Salaam-Heisman.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Rashaan Salaam]]'s 1994 Heisman Trophy]]

The award was first presented in 1935 by the [[Downtown Athletic Club]] (DAC) in [[New York]], a privately owned recreation facility located on the lower west side near the later site of the former [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. It was first known simply as the DAC Trophy. The first winner, [[Jay Berwanger]], was drafted by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] but declined to sign for them. He never played professional football for any team. In 1936, [[John Heisman]] died and the trophy was renamed in his honor. [[Larry Kelley]], the second winner of the award, was the first man to win it as the "Heisman Trophy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heisman.com/history/heisman_trophy.php|title=The Heisman Trophy|publisher=heisman.com|accessdate=2012-01-04}}</ref>

The first African American player to win the Heisman was Syracuse's [[Ernie Davis]], who never played a snap in the NFL. He was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] shortly after winning the award and died in 1963. In 1966, former [[1966 Florida Gators football team|Florida Gators]] quarterback [[Steve Spurrier]] gave his Heisman trophy to the university president Dr. [[J. Wayne Reitz]] so that the award could be shared by Florida students and faculty.<ref name="info" /> The gesture caused Florida's student government to raise funds to purchase a replacement trophy for Spurrier.<ref name="info" /> Since then, the Downtown Athletic Club has issued two trophies to winners, one to the individual and a replica to his college.<ref name="info" />

Several Heisman trophies have been sold over the years. [[O. J. Simpson]]'s 1968 trophy was sold in February 1999 for [[United States dollar|$]]230,000 as part of the settlement of the civil trial in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]].<ref name="info" /> Yale end [[Larry Kelley]] sold his 1936 Heisman in December 1999 for the sum of $328,110 to settle his estate and to provide a bequest for his family.<ref name="info" /> [[Charles White (American football)|Charles White]]'s 1979 trophy first sold for $184,000 and then for nearly $300,000 in December 2006 to help pay back federal income taxes.<ref name="info" /> The current record price for a Heisman belongs to the trophy won by Minnesota halfback [[Bruce Smith (American football)|Bruce Smith]] in 1941 at $395,240.<ref name="info" /> [[Paul Hornung]] sold his Heisman for $250,000 to endow student scholarships for [[University of Notre Dame]] students from his hometown of [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref name="info" /> Eliscu's original plaster cast sold at [[Sotheby's]] for $228,000 in December 2005.<ref name="info" />

==Television coverage==
The presentation of the Heisman trophy was not broadcast on television until [[1977 in television|1977]].<ref>[http://the506.com/yabb/YaBB.pl?num=1229651343 Heisman Trophy Presentation broadcast history?]</ref> Before 1977, the presentation of the award was not televised as a stand-alone special, but rather as a quick in-game feature. The ceremony usually aired on [[College Football on ABC|ABC]] as a feature at halftime of the last major national telecast (generally a rivalry game) of the college football season. ABC essentially showed highlights since the award was handed out as part of an annual weeknight dinner at the Heisman Club. At the time, the event had usually been scheduled for the week following the [[Army–Navy Game]].{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}

On December 8, 1977, CBS (who paid $200,000 for the rights) aired a one-hour (at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]) special to celebrate the presentation of the Heisman trophy to [[Earl Campbell]] of the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]]. [[Elliott Gould]] and O. J. Simpson were the co-hosts, with [[Connie Stevens]] and [[Leslie Uggams]] providing musical entertainment and [[Robert Klein]] providing some comic relief.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Since then, a number of companies have provided television coverage of the event:{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}
* [[CBS]] (1977–1980)
* [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (1981–1984) – [[Owned-and-operated television stations in the United States#ABC 2|owned-and-operated stations]] only
* [[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]] (1981–1985)
* [[NBC]] (1985) – [[Owned-and-operated television stations in the United States#NBC 2|owned-and-operated stations]] only
* [[CBS]] (1986–1990)
* [[NBC]] (1991–1993)
* [[ESPN]] (1994–present)

==Controversy and politics==

===Regional bias controversy===
A number of critics have expressed concern about the unwritten rules regarding player position and age, as noted above.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Over the years, there has been substantial criticism of a regional bias, suggesting that the Heisman balloting process has ignored West Coast players.<ref>http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/huskyfootball/2012722882_heismanvoters29.html, ''Seattle Times'', Bob Condotta, Retrieved 2 Oct 2010.</ref>  At present, the [[Pac-12 Conference]] (Pac-12, formerly Pac-10, formerly Pac-8), represents 12 of the 77 teams (roughly 16%) in the [[Automatic Qualifying conference]]s.  The Heisman can, and has been, presented to players from other conferences, but a random sample over a long period of time might suggest that Pac-10/12 players might win 16% of the Heisman awards.<ref>http://blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports/2009/12/11/toby-gerhart-and-the-heisman-trophy-analyzing-the-voting-blocs/, ''San Jose Mercury News'', John Wilner, Retrieved 2 Oct 2010.</ref> In the 20 seasons between 1981 ([[Marcus Allen]]) and 2002 ([[Carson Palmer]]), not a single [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10 Conference]] or other West Coast player won the Heisman Trophy. Three [[USC Trojans football|Southern California]] (USC) players have won the trophy in the early years of the 21st century and two won it subsequent to Palmer. Although [[Terry Baker]], quarterback from [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]], won the trophy in 1962, and [[Gary Beban]] from [[UCLA football|UCLA]] won in 1967, no non-USC player from the West Coast until Marcus Mariota in 2014 had won since [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]'s [[Jim Plunkett]] in 1970. The closest since then had been [[Toby Gerhart]], [[Andrew Luck]], and [[Christian McCaffrey]], Stanford players who were second in the Heisman balloting each year from 2009–11 and 2015. [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon's]] [[Marcus Mariota]] is the first non-USC player from the west coast to win the Heisman since Stanford's Jim Plunkett win in 1970.

The West Coast bias discussion usually centers on the idea that East Coast voters see few West Coast games, because of television coverage contracts, [[time zone]] differences, or cultural interest. At Heisman-projection Web site StiffArmTrophy.com, commentator [[Kari Chisholm]] claims that the Heisman balloting process itself is inherently biased:

<blockquote>"For Heisman voting purposes, the nation is divided into six regions—each of which get 145 votes. Put another way, each region gets exactly 16.67 percent of the votes. However, each region does not constitute an even one-sixth of the population. Three regions (Far West, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic) have larger populations than 16.67% of the national population; and three have less (Northeast, South, and Southwest). In fact, the Far West has the greatest population at 21.2% of the country and the Northeast has the least at 11.9%."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.stiffarmtrophy.com/2003/10/west_coast_bias.html |title=West Coast Bias |publisher=StiffArmTrophy |accessdate=2007-11-20}}</ref></blockquote>

==={{anchor|vacation}}Nullification of 2005 award===
{{see also|Reggie Bush#NCAA investigation and lawsuits}}
In 2010 [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California]] athletic director [[Pat Haden]] announced the university would return its replica of the 2005 Heisman Trophy due to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sanctions requiring the university to dissociate itself from [[Reggie Bush]]. The NCAA found that Bush had received gifts from an agent while at USC. On September 14, 2010, Bush voluntarily forfeited his title as a Heisman winner. The next day, the Heisman Trust announced the 2005 award would remain vacated and removed all mention of the 2005 award from its official website.<ref>{{cite news|title=Reggie Bush's Heisman to stay vacated|date=September 16, 2010|work=ESPN.com|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/los-angeles/ncf/news/story?id=5576729|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69y2QisUH|archivedate=August 16, 2012|deadurl=no}}</ref> Bush eventually returned the trophy itself to the Heisman Trust in 2012.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/los-angeles/ncf/story/_/id/8272932/former-usc-trojans-running-back-reggie-bush-returned-2005-heisman-trophy "Reggie Bush returned Heisman"], [[ESPN.com]], August 16, 2012.</ref>

Critical responses from the national media were strident and varied. [[CBSSports.com]] producer J. Darin Darst opined that Bush "should never have been pressured to return the award." Kalani Simpson of [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] wrote, "Nice try Heisman Trust...It's a slick move to try to wipe the slate clean." Football Writers Association of America Past-President Dennis Dodd, on the other hand, decided to fictitiously award Bush's vacated 2005 award to [[Vince Young]], the original runner-up that year. He wrote, "Since the Heisman folks won't re-vote, we did. Vince Young is the ''new'' winner of the 2005 Heisman." A ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' piece argued that Bush's Heisman was "tainted" but lamented that the decision came five years after Bush was awarded the trophy and, therefore, four years after the expiration of Bush's term as current holder of the Heisman title.<ref>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/16/vince-young-heisman-troph_n_718887.html, ''The Huffington Post'', Retrieved September 28, 2010</ref><ref>http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/6270202/24752749, CBSSports.com, Retrieved September 28, 2010</ref><ref>http://msn.foxsports.com/collegefootball/story/Reggie-Bush-Heisman-Trophy-asterisk-091410, Foxsports.com, Retrieved September 28, 2010</ref><ref>http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/16/opinion/la-ed-bush-20100916, ''Los Angeles Times'', Retrieved September 28, 2010</ref>
