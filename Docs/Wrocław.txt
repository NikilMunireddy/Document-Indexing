'''Wrocław''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|v|r|ɒ|t|s|w|ə|f}}; {{IPA-pl|ˈvrɔt͡swaf|-|Pl-Wrocław-2.ogg}}, {{lang-de|Breslau}}, <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[b (IPA)|b]][[ʁ]][[ɛ (IPA)|ɛ]][[z (IPA)|s̬]][[l (IPA)|l]][[a (IPA)|a]][[ʊ (IPA)|ʊ]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>; {{lang-la|Vratislavia}}) is the largest city in western [[Poland]]. It is on the River [[Oder]] in the [[Silesian Lowlands]] of [[Central Europe]], roughly {{convert|350|km|mi}} from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the north and {{convert|40|km|mi}} from the [[Sudetes|Sudeten Mountains]] to the south. Wrocław is the historical capital of [[Silesia]] and [[Lower Silesia]]. Today, it is the capital of the [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]]. At various times in history, it has been part of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]], [[Bohemia]], [[Hungary]], the [[Austrian Empire]], [[Prussia]], and [[Germany]]. It became part of Poland in 1945, as a result of the [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|border changes after the Second World War]]. The population of Wrocław in 2014 was 634,487,<ref name="stat.gov.pl">http://stat.gov.pl/bdl/app/dane_podgrup.hier?p_id=415350&p_token=1275767262</ref> making it the [[List of cities and towns in Poland#Largest cities by size|fourth-largest city in Poland]].

Wrocław classified as a [[global city]] by [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network|GaWC]], with the ranking of high sufficiency and living standard.
It was among 230 cities in the world in the ranking of the consulting company [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]] - "Best City to Live" in 2015 and the only Polish city in this ranking has been recognized as a city growing at the business center.<ref>http://www.uk.mercer.com/newsroom/2015-quality-of-living-survey.html</ref>

In 2016, the city is a [[European Capital of Culture]] and the [[World Book Capital]]. Also, Wrocław will host the [[Theatre Olympics]], [[World Team Olympiad|World Bridge Games]] and the [[European Film Awards]] in 2016, [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]] Annual Conference and [[World Games]] in 2017.

==Etymology==
The city's name was first recorded as "Wrotizlava" in the chronicle of [[Germans|German]] chronicler [[Thietmar of Merseburg]], which mentions it as a seat of a newly installed [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław|bishopric]] in the context of the [[Congress of Gniezno]]. The first municipal seal stated ''Sigillum civitatis Wratislavie''. A simplified name is given, in 1175, as Wrezlaw, Prezla or Breslaw. The [[Czech language|Czech]] spelling was used in Latin documents as ''Wratislavia'' or ''Vratislavia''. At that time, ''Prezla'' was used in [[Middle High German]], which became ''Preßlau''. In the middle of the 14th century, the [[Early New High German]] (and later [[New High German]]) form of the name, ''Breslau'', began to replace its earlier versions.

The city is traditionally believed to be named after Wrocisław or Vratislav, often believed to be Duke [[Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Vratislaus I of Bohemia]]. It is also possible that the city was named after the tribal duke of the [[Silesians]] or after an early ruler of the city called Vratislav.

The city's name in various other languages is: {{lang-hu|Boroszló}}, {{lang-cs|Vratislav}}, [[German language|German]]: Breslau, {{lang-he|ורוצלב}} (''Vrotsláv''), {{lang-yi|ברעסלוי}} (''Bresloi''), [[Silesian German]]: ''Brassel'', and {{lang-la|Vratislavia}} or ''Budorgis''<ref name="Orbis latinus oder Verzeichniss der lateinischen Benennungen der bekanntesten Städte etc., Meere, Seen, Berge und Flüsse in allen Theilen der Erde nebst einem deutsch-lateinischen Register derselben."/> or ''Wratislavia''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sbc.org.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=35261&from=publication |title=Wratislavia sive Budorgis celebris Elysiorum metropolis |publisher=Sbc.org.pl |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-04-24}}</ref> The city's name in other languages is available at [[Names of European cities in different languages: U-Z#W|the list of names of European cities]].

Persons born or living in the city are known as "[[List of people from Wrocław|Vratislavians]]" ({{lang-pl|Wrocławianie}}).

==History==
{{Main|History of Wrocław|Timeline of Wrocław}}
The city of Wrocław originated at the intersection of two [[trade route]]s, the [[Via Regia]] and the [[Amber Road]]. In [[Ancient history|ancient]] times at or near Wrocław was a place called Budorigum. It has been mapped to the ancient [[Ptolemy]] map of the years 142-147 AD. Settlements in the area existed from the 6th century onward, when a [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribe [[Ślężanie|Ślężans]] settled on the Oder and erected on [[Ostrów Tumski in Wrocław|Ostrów Tumski]] a [[Gord (archaeology)|gord]].

The city was first recorded in the 10th century as ''Vratislavia'', the Bohemian duke [[Vratislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Vratislaus I]] founded here a Bohemian stronghold.<ref>http://www.inyourpocket.com/wroclaw/History</ref> ''Vratislavia'' was possibly derived from the duke's name Vratislav. In 990, Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] of Poland conquered Silesia including Wroclaw. The town was mentioned explicitly in the year 1000 in connection with a founding of a bishopric.

===Middle Ages===
The medieval chronicle, ''[[Gesta principum Polonorum]]'', written by [[Gallus Anonymus]] in 1112-1116 AD, named Wrocław, along with [[Kraków]] and [[Sandomierz]], as one of the three capitals of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Polish Kingdom]].

During Wrocław's early history, the control over it changed hands between Bohemia (until 992, then 1038–1054), the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] (992–1038 and 1054–1202), and after the [[History of Poland (966–1385)|fragmentation of the Kingdom of Poland]], the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]]-ruled [[Duchies of Silesia|duchy of Silesia]]. One of the most important events during this period was the foundation of the [[Diocese of Wrocław]] by the Polish Duke (from 1025 King) [[Bolesław the Brave]] in 1000. Along with the [[Diocese|Bishopric]]s of [[Bishopric of Kraków|Kraków]] and [[Bishopric of Kołobrzeg|Kołobrzeg]], Wrocław was placed under the [[Archbishopric of Gniezno]] in [[Greater Poland]], founded by [[Pope Sylvester II]] through the intercession of the Emperor [[Otto III]] in 1000, during the [[Congress of Gniezno]]. In the years 1034-1038 the city was affected by [[Pagan reaction in Poland]].<ref name="mikrokosmos"/>

The city became a commercial centre and expanded to {{Ill|pl|Wyspa Piasek|Wyspa Piasek we Wrocławiu}} (Sand Island), and then to the left bank of the [[River Oder]]. Around 1000, the town had about 1,000 inhabitants.<ref name="weczerka"/> By 1139, a settlement belonging to Governor [[Piotr Włostowic]] (a.k.a. Piotr Włast [[Dunin (surname)|Dunin]]) was built, and another was founded on the left bank of the River Oder, near the present seat of the University. While the city was Polish, there were also communities of [[Bohemia]]ns, [[Jews]], [[Walloons]]<ref name="mikrokosmos"/> and [[Germany|Germans]].<ref name="weczerka1"/>

[[File:Kościół św. Idziego - plac Katedralny - fot B.Maliszewska.jpg|thumb|170px|Church of Saint Giles [[:pl:Kościół św. Idziego we Wrocławiu|(pl)]] Erected in the 1220s at [[Ostrów Tumski, Wrocław]]]]

In the 13th century, Wrocław was the political centre of the divided [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Polish kingdom]].<ref name="Henryk Brodaty i jego czasy"/> In April 1241, during fearing the [[First Mongol invasion of Poland]] the city was abandoned by the inhabitants and  burned for strategic reasons. During the battles with the Mongols the [[:pl:Zamek na Ostrowie Tumskim we Wrocławiu|Wrocław Castle]] was defended by [[Henry II the Pious]] and was never captured.<ref name="mikrokosmos2"/>

After the Mongol invasion the town was partly populated by [[Ostsiedlung|German settlers]]<ref name="Thum, p. 316"/> who, in the following centuries, would gradually become its dominant [[ethnic group]]; the city, however, retained its multi-ethnic character, a reflection of its position as an important trading city on the [[Via Regia]] and the [[Amber Road]].<ref name="mikrokosmos3"/>

With the influx of settlers the town expanded and adopted in 1242 [[German town law]]. The [[city council]] used [[Latin]] and [[German language|German]], and "Breslau", the Germanized name of the city, appeared for the first time in written records.<ref name="Thum, p. 316"/> The enlarged town covered around 60&nbsp;hectares, and the new main market square, which was surrounded by timber frame houses, became the new centre of the town. The original foundation, Ostrów Tumski, became the religious center. The city adopted [[Magdeburg rights]] in 1261. The Polish Piast dynasty<ref name="google"/> remained in control of the region, but the right of the city council to govern independently increased.

In 1335, Wrocław, and almost all of Silesia, was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], then a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Between 1342 and 1344, two fires destroyed large parts of the city. The city joined the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1387.

In June 5, 1443, the city was affected by an earthquake of the strength of at least 6 degrees on the Richter scale, which destroyed or seriously damaged many buildings in the city. From 1469-1490 it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary and the King of Hungary Matthias Corvinus even had a mistress from the city with whom he had a son. In 1474, the city left the Hanseatic League. In 1475, Kasper Elyan printed in Wrocław ''Statuta Synodalia Episcoporum Wratislaviensium'', first in the history of printing in the Polish language, it contains three Catholic prayers.

===Renaissance, Reformation and Counter-Reformation===
[[File:Breslau c1736.jpg|thumb|''City Towers'' in 1736]]
The [[Protestant Reformation]] reached the town in 1518 and the city became Protestant. However, from 1526 Silesia was ruled by the Catholic [[House of Habsburg]]. In 1618, it supported the [[Thirty Years' War|Bohemian Revolt]] out of fear of losing the right to [[Freedom of religion|freedom of religious expression]]. During the ensuing [[Thirty Years' War]], the city was occupied by [[Saxony|Saxon]] and Swedish troops, and lost 18,000 of 40,000 citizens to [[Plague (disease)|plague]].

The [[Emperor of Austria|Austrian emperor]] brought in the [[Counter-Reformation]] by encouraging Catholic orders to settle in the city, starting in 1610 with the [[Franciscan]]s, followed by [[Jesuit]]s,<ref>http://www.inyourpocket.com/wroclaw/History</ref> [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]]s, and finally [[Ursulines]] in 1687. These orders erected buildings which shaped the city's appearance until 1945. At the end of the Thirty Years' War, however, it was one of only a few Silesian cities to stay Protestant.

The precise record keeping of births and deaths by the city led to the use of their data for analysis of mortality, first by [[John Graunt]], and then later by [[Edmond Halley]]. Halley's tables and analysis, published in 1693, are considered to be the first true [[actuarial science|actuarial]] tables, and thus the foundation of modern actuarial science.

During the Counter-Reformation, the intellectual life of the city flourished, as the Protestant [[bourgeois]]ie lost its role to the Catholic orders as the patron of the arts. The city became the centre of German [[Baroque literature]] and was home to the First and Second Silesian school of poets.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The [[Kingdom of Prussia]] annexed the town and most of Silesia during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] in the 1740s. [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] empress [[Maria Theresa]] ceded the territory in the [[Treaty of Breslau]] in 1742.

===Napoleonic Wars===
[[File:Entrée du Prince Jérôme à Breslau le 7 janvier 1807.PNG|thumb|''Entry of Prince [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] to Breslau, 7 January 1807'']]

During [[Napoleonic Wars|the Napoleonic Wars]], it was occupied by an army of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. The fortifications of the city were leveled<ref>http://www.inyourpocket.com/wroclaw/History</ref> and monasteries and cloisters were secularised. The Protestant [[Viadrina European University]] of [[Frankfurt (Oder)]] was relocated to Breslau in 1811, and united with the local Jesuit University to create the new Silesian Frederick-William University (''Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelm-Universität'', now [[University of Wrocław]]). The city became the centre of the German Liberation movement against Napoleon, and the gathering place for volunteers from all over Germany, with the [[Iron Cross]] [[military decoration]] founded by [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] in early March 1813. The city was the centre of [[Prussia]]n mobilisation for the campaign which ended at [[Leipzig]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Prussia and Germany===
[[File:Ansicht Breslau um 1850.jpg|thumb|[[Oder]] in 1850]]
[[File:Breslau Ring Ostseite (1890-1900).jpg|thumb|[[Market Square, Wrocław|Market Square]] 1890-1900]]
[[File:Breslau um 1900.jpg|thumb|[[Wrocław Town Hall|Town Hall]] 1900]]

[[Confederation of the Rhine|Napoleonic redevelopments]] increased prosperity in Silesia and the city. The levelled fortifications opened space for the city to grow beyond its old limits. Breslau became an important railway hub and industrial centre, notably of linen and [[Cotton|cotton manufacture]] and metal industry. The reconstructed university served as a major centre of sciences, while the secularisation of life laid the base for a rich museum landscape. [[Johannes Brahms]] wrote his [[Academic Festival Overture]] to thank the university for an honorary doctorate awarded in 1881.

In 1821, [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław|(Arch)Diocese of Breslau]] was disentangled from the Polish ecclesiastical province (archbishopric) in Gniezno and made Breslau an exempt bishopric. On October 10, 1854, the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau|Jewish Theological Seminary]] opened. The institution was the first modern rabbinical seminary in Central Europe. In 1863 the brothers Karl and Louis Stangen founded the travel agency Stangen, this was the second travel agency in the world.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The [[Unification of Germany]] in 1871 turned Breslau into the sixth-largest city in the [[German Empire]]. Its population more than tripled to over half a million between 1860 and 1910. The 1900 census listed 422,709 residents.

In 1890, construction began on the [[Fortification|forts]] of [[:pl:Twierdza Wrocław 1890–1918|Breslau Fortress]]. Important landmarks were inaugurated in 1910, the ''Kaiser bridge'' and the ''Technical University'', which now houses the [[Wrocław University of Technology]].
The 1900 census listed 98% as German-speakers, with 5,363 Polish-speakers (1.3%), and another 3,103 (0.7%) speaking both German and Polish.<ref name="konversationslexikon394"/> The population was 58% Protestant, 37% Catholic (including at least 2% Polish)<ref name="harasimowicz"/>{{clarify|date=September 2013}} and 5% Jewish (totaling 20,536 in the 1905 census).<ref name="konversationslexikon394"/> The [[Jewish community]] of Breslau was among the most important in Germany, producing several distinguished artists and scientists.<ref name="wisc"/>

Since 1912 Head of the Department of Psychiatry at the [[University of Wrocław]] and director of the Clinic of Psychiatry (Königlich Psychiatrischen und Nervenklinik) was [[Alois Alzheimer]].

In 1912, the Wrocław University professor [[William Stern (psychologist)|William Stern]] introduced the concept of [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]].

In 1913, the newly built [[Centennial Hall]] housed the ''"Ausstellung zur Jahrhundertfeier der Freiheitskriege"'', an exhibition commemorating the 100th anniversary of the historical [[War of the Sixth Coalition|German Wars of Liberation]] against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and the first award of the [[Iron Cross]].

Following [[World War I]], Breslau became the capital of the newly created Prussian [[Province of Lower Silesia]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] in 1919. After the War the Polish community began holding masses in the Polish language at the [[Saint Anne Church, Wrocław|Church of Saint Anne]], and, as of 1921, at St. Martin's; a Polish consulate was opened on the Main Square, and a Polish School was founded by {{Ill|pl|Helena Adamczewska}}.<ref name="Microcosm, page 361">Microcosm, page 361</ref>

In August 1920, during the Polish [[Silesian Uprisings|Silesian Uprising]] in [[Upper Silesia]], the Polish Consulate and School were destroyed, while the Polish Library was burned down by a mob. The number of Poles as a percentage of the total population fell to just 0.5% after the reconstitution of [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|Poland]] in 1918, when many moved to Poland.<ref name="harasimowicz"/> [[antisemitism|Antisemitic]] riots occurred in 1923.<ref name="Microcosm_396"/>

The city boundaries were expanded between 1925 and 1930 to include an area of {{convert|175|km²|abbr=on}} with a population of 600,000. In 1929, the [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] opened ''WuWa'' ({{lang-de|Wohnungs- und Werkraumausstellung}}) in Breslau-Scheitnig, an international showcase of [[modern architecture]] by architects of the Silesian branch of the Werkbund. In June 1930, Breslau hosted the ''Deutsche Kampfspiele'', a [[Sport|sporting event]] for German athletes after Germany was excluded from the [[Olympic Games]] after World War I. The number of Jews remaining in Breslau fell from 23,240 in 1925 to 10,659 in 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.verwaltungsgeschichte.de/sch_breslau.html |title=Territorial organisation of Breslau (German) |publisher=Verwaltungsgeschichte.de |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> Up to the beginning of World War II, Breslau was the largest city in Germany east of Berlin.<ref>[http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9568.html Uprooted: How Breslau Became Wrocław During the Century of Expulsions.

Known as a stronghold of [[Left-wing politics|left wing liberalism]] during the German Empire,<ref>{{cite book |last=van Rahden |first= Till |authorlink=Till van Rahden |year= 2008 |title=Jews and other Germans: civil society, religious diversity, and urban politics in Breslau, 1860-1925 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |page=234}}</ref> Breslau eventually became one of the strongest support bases of the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s, who in the 1932 elections received 44% of the city's vote, their third-highest total in all Germany.<ref name="mikrokosmos4"/>

[[KZ Dürrgoy]]- one of the first concentration camps in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] - was set up in Wrocław in 1933.

After Hitler's [[NSDAP#In power: 1933–1945|appointment as German Chancellor]] in 1933, political enemies of the Nazis were persecuted, and their institutions closed or destroyed; the [[Gestapo]] began actions against Polish and Jewish students (see: [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]]), [[KPD|Communists]], [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], and [[trade unionists]]. Arrests were made for speaking Polish in public, and in 1938 the Nazi-controlled police destroyed the Polish cultural centre.<ref name="Microcosm_395"/><ref name="Kulak_252"/> Many of the city's 10,000 Jews, as well as many others seen as 'undesirable' by the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], were sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]]; those Jews who remained were killed during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].<ref name="Microcosm_395"/> A network of [[Internment|concentration camps]] and [[Arbeitslager|forced labour camps]] was established around Breslau, to serve industrial concerns, including [[FAMO]], [[Junkers]] and [[Krupp]]. Tens of thousands were imprisoned there.<ref name="RM"/>

The last big event organised by the [[Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund für Leibesübungen|Nazi Sports Body]], called [[Deutsches Turn- und Sportfest 1938|Deutsches Turn-und-Sportfest]] (Gym and Sports Festivities), took place in Breslau from 26 to 31 July 1938. The Sportsfest was held to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the German Wars of Liberation against Napoleon's invasion.<ref name="SF"/>

===World War II and afterwards===
[[File:FestungBreslau6V1945.jpg|thumb|left|Delegation of German officers walking for negotiations before [[capitulation (surrender)|capitulation]] of [[Siege of Breslau|Festung Breslau]], 6 May 1945]]
For most of [[World War II]], the fighting did not affect Breslau. In 1941 the remnants of the pre-war Polish minority in the city, as well as Polish slave labourers, organised a resistance group called [[Olimp (organization)|Olimp]]. The organisation gathered intelligence, carrying out sabotage, and organizing aid for Polish slave workers. As the war continued, refugees from bombed-out German cities, and later refugees from farther east, swelled the population to nearly one million,<ref name="wroclaw"/> including 51,000 forced labourers in 1944, and 9,876 Allied PoWs. At the end of 1944 an additional 30,000-60,000 Poles were moved into the city after Nazis crushed the [[Warsaw Uprising]].<ref name="mikrokosmos5"/> In February 1945 the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] approached the city. [[Gauleiter]] [[Karl Hanke]] declared the city a ''Festung'' (fortress) to be held at all costs. Hanke finally lifted a ban on the evacuation of women and children when it was almost too late. During his poorly organised evacuation in January 1945, 18,000 people froze to death in icy snowstorms and {{convert|-20|C|0|abbr=on}} weather. By the end of the [[Siege of Breslau|Battle of Breslau]], half the city had been destroyed. An estimated 40,000 civilians lay dead in the ruins of homes and factories. After a siege of nearly three months, Hanke surrendered on 6 May 1945, two days before the end of the war.<ref name="Festung Breslau (Breslau Fortress) siege by the Soviet Army – photo gallery"/> In August the Soviets placed the city under the control of German anti-fascists.<ref name="Mazower, M 2008 P544">Mazower, M(2008) Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe, Penguin Press P544</ref>

Along with almost all of Lower Silesia, however, the city became part of Poland under the terms of the [[Potsdam Conference]]. The Polish name of "Wrocław" was declared official. There had been discussion among the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] to place the southern Polish-German boundary on the [[Glatzer Neisse]], which meant post-war Germany would have been allowed to retain approximately half of Silesia, including Breslau. However, the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] insisted the border be drawn at the [[Lusatian Neisse]] farther west.

===After the war===
[[File:Krasnal-Wroclaw-ulSwidnicka.jpg|thumb|Monument of the [[Orange Alternative]]]]
In August 1945, the city had a German population of 189,500, and a Polish population of 17,000; that was soon to change.<ref name="Mazower, M 2008 P544"/>  Almost all of the German inhabitants [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|fled or were forcibly expelled]] between 1945 and 1949 and were settled in the [[Soviet occupation zone]] and [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied Occupation Zones]] in Germany. The city's last pre-war German school was closed in 1963. A small German minority (about 1,000 people) remains in the city.<ref name="ntkswroclaw"/> The Polish population was dramatically increased by the resettlement of Poles during postwar [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|population transfers]] during the forced [[deportation]]s from [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Polish lands annexed by the Soviet Union]] in [[Kresy|the east]] region, many of whom came from [[Lviv]] (''Lwów''), [[Volhynia]] and [[Vilnius Region]].

Wrocław is now a unique European city of mixed heritage, with architecture influenced by [[Bohemia]]n, [[:Category:Austrian architecture|Austrian]] and [[Prussia]]n traditions, such as Silesian [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and its [[Baroque]] style of court builders of Habsburg Austria ([[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach|Fischer von Erlach]]). Wrocław has a number of notable buildings by German [[modernism|modernist]] architects including the famous [[Centennial Hall]] (''Hala Stulecia'' or ''Jahrhunderthalle'') (1911–1913) designed by [[Max Berg]]. In 1948, Wrocław organized the [[Recovered Territories]] Exhibition and the [[World Congress of Intellectuals in Defense of Peace]].

In 1963 Wrocław was declared a [[closed city]] because of a [[smallpox]] [[epidemic]].

At the beginning of June 1982, during the [[martial law in Poland]] was founded [[Fighting Solidarity]] - [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] underground organization, and in August - [[Orange Alternative]]. In 1983 and 1997, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the city.

PTV Echo - the first non-state TV in Poland and in the post-communist countries  began to broadcast in Wrocław at February 6, 1990.

In May 1997, Wrocław hosted the 46th International [[Eucharistic Congress]].

In July 1997, the city was heavily affected by a [[1997 Central European flood|flood of the River Oder]], the worst flooding in post-war Poland, Germany and the [[Czech Republic]]. About one-third of the area of the city was flooded.<ref name="1997 great flood of Oder River – photo gallery"/> An earlier equally devastating flood of the river took place in 1903.<ref name="1903 great flood of the Oder river – photo gallery"/>
A small part of the city was also flooded during the [[2010 Central European floods|flood in 2010]]. In the years 2012-2015 lasted the renovation and redevelopment of the {{ill|pl|Wrocław water node|Wrocławski węzeł wodny}} to prevent further flooding. It cost more than 900 million [[Polish złoty|PLN]] (~220 million [[euro]]).

==Administration==
[[File:Nowy Ratusz (01).JPG|thumb|right|Wrocław New Town Hall - seat of the president of the city]]
[[File:Wroclaw Urzad Wojewodzki.jpg|thumb|right|Building of the Wrocław Voivodeship Office]]
Wrocław is the capital city of [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]], a province ([[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeship]]) created in 1999. It was previously the seat of [[Wrocław Voivodeship]]. The city is a separate urban [[gmina]] and city county ([[powiat]]). It is also the seat of [[Wrocław County]], which adjoins but does not include the city.

Wrocław was previously subdivided into five boroughs ([[dzielnica]]):
*[[Wrocław-Fabryczna|Fabryczna]] ("Factory Quarter")
*[[Krzyki]], ({{lang-de|Krietern}}, meaning "Wranglers")
*[[Psie Pole]] ({{lang-de|Hundsfeld}}, "Dogs' Field", named so after the alleged [[Battle of Hundsfeld]] or poor quality of the fields)
*[[Wrocław-Stare Miasto|Stare Miasto]] (old town)
*[[Wrocław-Śródmieście|Śródmieście]] (midtown)

However, the city is now divided into 48 [[osiedle]]s (districts).

Wrocław is currently governed by the city's mayor and a municipal legislature known as the city council. The city council is made up of 39 councillors and is directly elected by the city's inhabitants. The remit of the council and president extends to all areas of municipal policy and development planning, up to and including development of local infrastructure, transport and planning permission. However, it is not able to draw taxation directly from its citizens, and instead receives its budget from the Polish national government whose seat is in Warsaw. The city's current mayor is [[Rafał Dutkiewicz]], who has served in this position since 2002.

==Wrocław in literature==
The history of Wrocław is described in minute detail in the monograph [[Microcosm: Portrait of a Central European City]] by [[Norman Davies]] and [[Roger Moorhouse]]. A number of books have been written about Wrocław following World War II. In 1959 [[Hans von Ahlfen]] and [[Hermann Niehoff]] published "So kämpfte Breslau" about the last commander of Festung Breslau. In 1963 Karol Jońca and Alfred Konieczny published the book "The Fall of Fortress Breslau" and in 1966 a diary of Father Paul Peikert titled "Chronicle of the days of the siege of Wrocław" ("Festung Breslau [Fortress Breslau] in den berichten eines Pfarrers. 22 Januar bis 6 Mai 1945"). In 1970 he published a book of Bolesław Dolata "Liberation of Lower Silesia in 1945". In 1975 Richard Majewski and Teresa Sozańska published the "Battle of Wrocław". In 1982 Majewski also published ''Dolny Śląsk 1945 – Wyzwolenie'' (Lower Silesia 1945 - Liberation) and in 1985 "Wrocław - the zero hour". In 2003 [[Gregor Thum]]  published a book ''Alien City. Wrocław 1945''. In 2011 Richard Hargreaves published ''Hitler's Final Fortress - Breslau 1945''. In 2013 Tomasz Głowiński edited ''Festung Breslau 1945 – Nieznany Obraz'' (Fortress Breslau 1945 - Unknown Picture) containing a collection of 13 papers presented at a scientific conference held in May 2011 at the University of Wrocław as well as "My experience in the Fortress Breslau - From the notes of the priest" by Walter Lassmann, parish priest of St. Joseph at today's Krakowska street, who was one of 35 Catholic priests allowed to remain in a besieged fortress.

Wrocław philologist and writer [[Marek Krajewski]] wrote a series of [[crime novel]]s about detective [[Eberhard Mock]], a fictional character from the city of Breslau. Accordingly, Michał Kaczmarek published ''Wrocław according to Eberhard Mock - Guide based on the books by Marek Krajewski''.

However, post-war resettlements from Poland's ethnically and religiously more diverse former eastern territories (known in Polish as ''[[Kresy]]'') and the eastern parts of post-1945 Poland (''see [[Operation Vistula]]'') account for a comparatively large portion of [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christians of mostly [[Ukrainians in Poland|Ukrainian]] and [[Lemkos|Lemko]] descent. Wrocław is also unique for its "Dzielnica Czterech Świątyń" (Borough of Four Temples) — a part of [[Stare Miasto, Wrocław|Stare Miasto]] (Old Town) where a Synagogue, a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]], a Roman Catholic church and an Eastern Orthodox church stand near each other. Other denominations present in Wrocław include: Adventist, Baptist, Free Christians, Jehovah's Witnesses, Latter-day Saints, Methodist and Pentecostal.

In 2007, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Wrocław established the [http://www.pastoralcentre.pl/ Pastoral Centre for English Speakers], which offers Mass on Sundays and Holy Days of Obligation, as well as other sacraments, fellowship, retreats, catechesis and pastoral care for all English-speaking Catholics and non-Catholics interested in the Catholic Church. The Pastoral Centre is under the care of [[Conventual Franciscans|Order of Friars Minor, Conventual (Franciscans)]] of the [http://www.zakonfranciszkanow.pl/ Kraków Province] in the parish of [[:pl:Kościół św. Karola Boromeusza we Wrocławiu|St Charles Borromeo (Św Karol Boromeusz)]].

Prior to World War II, Wroclaw, then known as Breslau, had the third largest Jewish population of all German cities.<ref name="timesofisraelsynagogue">[http://www.timesofisrael.com/polish-city-marks-first-rabbinic-ordination-since-world-war-ii/ Polish city marks first rabbinic ordination since World War II], ''[[The Times of Israel]]'', September 3, 2014</ref> Its [[White Stork Synagogue]] was built in 1840.<ref name="timesofisraelsynagogue"/> It was only rededicated in 2010.<ref name="timesofisraelsynagogue"/> Four years later, in 2014, it celebrated its first ordination of four rabbis and three cantors since the Second World War.<ref name="timesofisraelsynagogue"/> The German Foreign Minister attended the ceremony.<ref name="timesofisraelsynagogue"/>
