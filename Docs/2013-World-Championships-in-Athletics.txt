The '''14th [[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships in Athletics]]''' (or just '''Moscow 2013''')<ref name=M2013_21082013/> was an international [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] competition held in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], from 10–18 August 2013. [[Russia at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics|Russia]] won the most gold medals to top the table for the first time since 2001. It was also the first time ever the host nation took the top of the medal table. The [[United States at the 2013 World Championships in Athletics|United States]] won the most overall medals. With 1,784 athletes from 203 countries it was the biggest single sports event of the year.<ref name=DW_09082013/> The number of spectators for the evening sessions was 268,548 surpassing Daegu 2011.<ref name=M2013_19082013/>

Jamaica's [[Usain Bolt]] and [[Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce]] both won three gold medals in the men's and women's [[100 metres]], [[200 metres]] and [[4×100 metres relay]] respectively to become the most successful athletes at the event. This achievement also earned Bolt the title of being the [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics#Multiple medallist|most successful athlete in the history of the World Championships]] with eight gold and two silver medals. Prior to the competition, four sprinters were banned on doping charges.<ref name=NYT_09082013/>

==Bidding process==
When the seeking deadline passed on 1 December 2006, four candidate cities had confirmed their candidatures.<ref name="candidates"/> These were: [[Barcelona]] (Spain), [[Brisbane]] (Australia), [[Moscow]] (Russia) and [[Gothenburg]] (Sweden). The IAAF announced Moscow the winning candidate at the IAAF Council Meeting in [[Mombasa]] on 27 March 2007.<ref name="IAAF_1"/>

Gothenburg backed out already in December, citing lack of financial support from the Swedish government.<ref name="Gothenburg"/> Barcelona had a record of hosting the [[Athletics at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1995 IAAF World Indoor Championships]]. It was chosen over [[Madrid]] and [[Valencia]], which were at one point outlined as possible candidates.<ref name="candidates"/> (Barcelona was later selected as the host for the [[2010 European Athletics Championships]]).

Brisbane simultaneously bid for 2011 and 2013 World Championships with the primary focus being on the 2011 event.<ref name="couriermail_1"/> Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre (formally [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]]) was the proposed venue. The venue previously hosted the [[Athletics at the 1982 Commonwealth Games|1982 Commonwealth Games]] and [[Athletics at the 2001 Goodwill Games|2001 Goodwill Games]].<ref name="couriermail_2"/> It was also a failed bidder for the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics]], which was eventually won by [[Berlin]].

In the case of Moscow, Deputy Mayor Valery Vinogradov announced on 13 March 2006 that the city would bid for the 2011 Championships and suggested [[Luzhniki Stadium]] as venue. When the IAAF elected to decide the 2011 and 2013 events at the same meeting, Moscow added its name to the 2013 list. The city previously hosted the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] (also at the Luzhniki Stadium) and the [[2006 IAAF World Indoor Championships]].<ref name="candidates"/>

==Venue==
Main venue was Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow with a capacity of 78,360 spectators.<ref name=SPM/>

==Anti-doping==

[[File:RusseDaryaVitalyevnaPishchalnikovaLondon2012.jpg|thumb|Russia's 2012 Olympic discus medallist [[Darya Pishchalnikova]] was among those banned for doping prior to the championships]]

At the championships the IAAF collected blood samples from all participating athletes, following the procedure introduced at the [[2011 World Championships in Athletics]], in line with supporting its Athlete Biological Passport programme. This assisted the federation in detecting athlete's potential usage of [[doping in athletics|banned substances]], including [[steroids]], [[human growth hormone]], [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] and [[blood doping]]. In addition to the mandatory blood tests, the IAAF also conducted around 500 urine tests at the championships in three groups: all medallists were subjected to urine tests, those showing biological passport anomalies were targeted, and random urine tests were also applied. Continuing with procedures initiated at the [[2005 World Championships in Athletics|2005 edition]], all urine tests were scheduled for long-term storage to allow retrospective testing in future. All athlete samples were processed at the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory accredited by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]].<ref>Landells, Steve (2013-08-05).

In the months preceding the event around 40 Russian athletes received doping bans. The most prominent of these were [[Darya Pishchalnikova]] (discus runner-up at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]]) and [[Olga Kuzenkova]] (former Olympic and world champion in the hammer throw). The Russian Athletics Federation president [[Valentin Balakhnichev]] defended the bans as proof of the increasing effectiveness of [[RUSADA]] (the Russian Anti-Doping Agency) which was only formed three years previously.<ref>[http://www.afp.com/en/news/topstories/russia-hosts-athletics-showpiece-doping-shadow Russia hosts athletics showpiece in doping shadow].

His sister was convicted of purchasing banned drugs with the intention to supply them to athletes. Former Russian coach Oleg Popov and [[400 metres]] runner [[Valentin Kruglyakov]] stated that athletes were ordered to dope and paid officials to conceal their positive tests.<ref>Harris, Nick & Kelner, Martha  (2013-07-07).

The drug testing results from the competition revealed several athletes had been using performance-enhancing drugs. The fifth-place finisher in the men's javelin, [[Roman Avramenko]] of Ukraine, tested positive for [[4-Chlorodehydromethyltestosterone]] (a steroid), as did Turkmenistan's [[Yelena Ryabova]] (a competitor in the women's 200&nbsp;m). Another 200&nbsp;m runner, [[Yelyzaveta Bryzgina]], also of Ukraine, was banned for the steroid [[drostanolone]]. Afghan 100&nbsp;m runner [[Masoud Azizi]] had [[nandrolone]] in his sample. Two athletes in the walking events, [[Ayman Kozhakhmetova]] and [[Ebrahim Rahimian]], failed their tests for EPO, as did Guatemala's marathon runner [[Jeremias Saloj]].<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/sport/athletics/seven-athletes-fail-doping-tests-at-world-athletics-championships-20130921-2u600.html Seven athletes fail doping tests at world athletics championships].
