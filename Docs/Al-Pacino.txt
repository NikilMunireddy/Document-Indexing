'''Alfredo James''' "'''Al'''" '''Pacino''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|tʃ|iː|n|oʊ}}; born April 25, 1940) is an American actor of stage and screen, filmmaker, and screenwriter. Pacino has had a career spanning fifty years, during which time he has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Al Pacino|numerous accolades and honors]] both competitive and honorary, among them an [[Academy Award]], two [[Tony Award]]s, two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Award]], four [[Golden Globe Award]]s, the [[AFI Life Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]] from the [[American Film Institute]], the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award]], and the [[National Medal of Arts]]. He is also one of few performers to have won [[List of people who have won Academy, Emmy, Grammy, and Tony Awards#Three competitive awards|a competitive Oscar, an Emmy and a Tony Award for acting]], dubbed the "Triple Crown of Acting".

A [[method acting|method actor]] and former student of the [[HB Studio|Herbert Berghof Studio]] and the [[Actors Studio]] in [[New York City]], where he was taught by Charlie Laughton and [[Lee Strasberg]], Pacino made his feature film debut with a minor role in ''[[Me, Natalie]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]) and gained favourable notices for his lead role as a [[heroin]] addict in ''[[The Panic in Needle Park]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]). He achieved international acclaim and recognition for his [[breakthrough role]] as [[Michael Corleone]] in [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]'' ([[1972 in film|1972]]). He received his first [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nomination and would reprise the role in sequels ''[[The Godfather Part II|Part II]]'' ([[1974 in film|1974]]) and ''[[The Godfather Part III|Part III]]'' ([[1990 in film|1990]]). Pacino's performance as Corleone is now regarded as one of the greatest screen performances in film history.

Pacino received his first [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Oscar]] nomination for ''[[Serpico]]'' ([[1973 in film|1973]]); he was also nominated for ''The Godfather Part II'', ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'' ([[1975 in film|1975]]) and ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]'' ([[1979 in film|1979]]) and won the award in [[65th Academy Awards|1993]] for his performance as a blind [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in ''[[Scent of a Woman (1992 film)|Scent of a Woman]]'' ([[1992 in film|1992]]).

In addition to his work in film, Pacino has had an extensive career on stage and is a two-time [[Tony Award]] winner, in [[23rd Tony Awards|1969]] and [[31st Tony Awards|1977]], for his performances in ''[[Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?]]'' and ''[[The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel]]'' respectively.  A lifelong fan of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Pacino directed and starred in ''[[Looking for Richard]]'' ([[1996 in film|1996]]), a [[documentary film]] about the play ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', a role which Pacino had earlier portrayed on-stage in 1977. He has also acted as [[Shylock]] in a [[The Merchant of Venice (2004 film)|2004 feature film adaptation]] and a 2010 production of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. Having made his filmmaking debut with ''Looking for Richard'', Pacino has also directed and starred in the [[independent film]] ''[[Chinese Coffee]]'' ([[2000 in film|2000]]) and the films ''[[Wilde Salomé]]'' ([[2011 in film|2011]]) and ''[[Salomé (2013 film)|Salomé]]'' ([[2013 in film|2013]]), about the play ''[[Salome (play)|Salomé]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]. Since 1994, Pacino has been the joint president of the [[Actors Studio]] with [[Ellen Burstyn]] and [[Harvey Keitel]].

==Early life and education==
Pacino was born in [[New York City]] ([[East Harlem#Italian Harlem|East Harlem]]),<ref name="biochannel"/> to [[Sicilian-American]] parents Salvatore Pacino and Rose, who divorced when he was two years old.<ref name="biochannel">{{cite web|url=http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-al-pacino |title=Al Pacino Biography|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]]|location=UK |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}</ref> His mother moved near the [[Bronx Zoo]] to live with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi, who, coincidentally, had come from a town in Sicily named [[Corleone, Sicily|Corleone]].<ref name="actors">{{cite episode |series=[[Inside the Actors Studio]] |network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] |airdate=October 2, 2006 |season=12 |number=20 |minutes= }}</ref> His father, who was from [[San Fratello]] in the [[Province of Messina]], moved to [[Covina, California]], and worked as an insurance salesman and restaurateur.<ref name="biochannel" />

In his teen years "Sonny", as he was known to his friends, aimed to become a baseball player, and was also nicknamed "The Actor".<ref name="page" /> Pacino dropped out of many classes, but not [[English studies|English]]. He dropped out of school at age 17. His mother disagreed with his decision; they argued and he left home. He worked at low-paying jobs, messenger, [[busboy]], [[janitor]], and postal clerk, to finance his acting studies.<ref name="biochannel" /> He once worked in the mail room for ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/al-pacino/trivia.html;jsessionid=2867EBF05815762FAEA7CAB6B0443F09|title=Al Pacino Biography|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}</ref>

He began smoking and drinking at age nine, and took up casual [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use at age 13, but never used [[Drug harmfulness|hard drugs]].<ref>Grobel; p. 9</ref> His two closest friends died from [[drug abuse]] at the ages of 19 and 30.<ref>Grobel; p. 8</ref> Growing up in The Bronx, he got into occasional fights and was considered something of a troublemaker at school.<ref>Grobel; p. 6</ref>

He acted in basement plays in New York's theatrical underground but was rejected for the [[Actors Studio]] while a teenager.<ref name="page" /> Pacino then joined the Herbert Berghof Studio ([[HB Studio]]), where he met acting teacher Charlie Laughton (not to be confused with the British actor [[Charles Laughton]]), who became his mentor and best friend.<ref name="page" /> In this period, he was often unemployed and [[homeless]], and sometimes slept on the street, in theaters, or at friends' houses.<ref name="actors" /><ref>Grobel; p. 14</ref>

In 1962, his mother died at the age of 43.<ref>Grobel; p. 10</ref> The following year, Pacino's grandfather James Gerardi, one of the most influential people in his life, also died.<ref name="biochannel" />

==Actors Studio training==
After four years at HB Studio, Pacino successfully auditioned for the Actors Studio.<ref name=page>Grobel; p. xix</ref> The Actors Studio is a membership organization of professional actors, [[theatre direction|theatre directors]] and playwrights in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] in New York City.<ref name=official /> Pacino studied "[[method acting]]"<ref name="biochannel" /> under acting coach [[Lee Strasberg]], who later appeared with Pacino in the films ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' and in ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]''.<ref name="actors" />

During later interviews he spoke about Strasberg and the Studio's effect on his career. "The Actors Studio meant so much to me in my life. Lee Strasberg hasn't been given the credit he deserves&nbsp;... Next to Charlie, it sort of launched me. It really did. That was a remarkable turning point in my life. It was directly responsible for getting me to quit all those jobs and just stay acting."<ref>Grobel; p. 15</ref>

In another interview he added, "It was exciting to work for him [Lee Strasberg] because he was so interesting when he talked about a scene or talked about people. One would just want to hear him talk, because things he would say, you'd never heard before&nbsp;... He had such a great understanding&nbsp;... he loved actors so much."<ref name="Lipton">Lipton, James. ''Inside Inside'', Dutton (2007)</ref>

Pacino is currently co-president, along with [[Ellen Burstyn]] and [[Harvey Keitel]], of the Actors Studio.<ref name=official>{{cite web|url= http://www.theactorsstudio.org/studio-history/ |title= Actors Studio History by Andreas Manolikakis |publisher=Actors Studio Official Website |accessdate=July 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100725161250/http://www.theactorsstudio.org/studio-history/| archivedate= July 25, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Stage career==
In 1967, Pacino spent a season at the Charles Playhouse in [[Boston]], performing in [[Clifford Odets]]' ''[[Awake and Sing!]]'' (his first major paycheck: $125 a week); and in Jean-Claude Van Itallie's ''America, Hurrah'', where he met actress [[Jill Clayburgh]] on this play.

I was 26, 25. And he discovered me and became my manager. And that's why I'm here. I owe it to Marty, I really do," Pacino himself has recently stated about his own career.<ref>[http://www.filmcontact.com/south-africa/al-pacino-and-cast-and-crew-talk-scarface Al Pacino and the cast and crew talk Scarface | | South Africa].

==Film career==

===Early film career===
Pacino found acting enjoyable and realized he had a gift for it while studying at The Actors Studio. However, his early work was not financially rewarding.<ref name="actors" /> After his success on stage, Pacino made his movie debut in 1969 with a brief appearance in ''[[Me, Natalie]]'', an independent film starring [[Patty Duke]].<ref>Grobel; p. xx</ref> In 1970, Pacino signed with the talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA).<ref name="multiple" />

===1970s===
It was the 1971 film ''[[The Panic in Needle Park]]'', in which he played a heroin addict,<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Colaciello |title=Turn-offs that turn on |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&dat=19710819&id=V8lHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7YsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6534,2997416 |newspaper=The Village Voice |publisher=Google News Archive |date=August 19, 1971 |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref> that brought Pacino to the attention of director [[Francis Ford Coppola]], who cast him as [[Michael Corleone]] in the blockbuster [[Mafia]] film ''[[The Godfather]]'' (1972). Although several established actors{{mdash}}including [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Warren Beatty]], and little-known [[Robert De Niro]]{{mdash}}also tried out for the part, Coppola selected the relatively unknown Pacino, to the dismay of studio executives.<ref name="actors" /><ref>{{cite news |title='Godfather' role still defines Pacino |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=266&dat=19970418&id=IvErAAAAIBAJ&sjid=0mkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6291,4152266 |newspaper=Kentucky New Era |publisher=Google News Archive |date=April 18, 1997 |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref>

Pacino's performance earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination, and offered a prime example of his early acting style, described by [[Halliwell's Film Guide]] as "intense" and "tightly clenched". Pacino boycotted the [[45th Academy Awards|Academy Award ceremony]], insulted at being nominated for the Supporting Acting award, noting that he had more screen time than co-star and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] winner [[Marlon Brando]]{{mdash}}who also boycotted the awards, but for unrelated reasons.<ref name="Grobel; p. xxi">Grobel; p. xxi</ref>

In 1973, he co-starred in ''[[Scarecrow (1973 film)|Scarecrow]]'', with [[Gene Hackman]], and won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. That same year, Pacino was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor after starring in ''[[Serpico]]'', based on the true story of New York City policeman [[Frank Serpico]], who went undercover to expose the corruption of fellow officers.<ref name="Grobel; p. xxi"/> In 1974, Pacino reprised his role as Michael Corleone in the sequel ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', which was the first sequel to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture Oscar]]; Pacino, meanwhile, was nominated for his third Oscar.<ref name="Grobel; p. xxi"/>

''[[Newsweek]]'' has described his performance in ''The Godfather Part II'' as "arguably cinema's greatest portrayal of the hardening of a heart".<ref>Grobel; p. xxii</ref> In 1975, he enjoyed further success with the release of ''[[Dog Day Afternoon]]'', based on the true story of bank robber [[John Wojtowicz]].<ref name="actors" /> It was directed by [[Sidney Lumet]], who had directed him in ''Serpico'' a few years earlier, and Pacino was again nominated for Best Actor.<ref name="Grobel; p. xxiii">Grobel; p. xxiii</ref>

In 1977, Pacino starred as a race-car driver in ''[[Bobby Deerfield]]'', directed by [[Sydney Pollack]], and received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama]] for his portrayal of the title role. His next film was the courtroom drama ''[[...And Justice for All (film)|...And Justice for All]]'', which again saw Pacino lauded by critics for his wide range of acting abilities, and nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for a fourth time.<ref name="Grobel; p. xxiii"/> However he lost out that year to [[Dustin Hoffman]] in ''[[Kramer vs. Kramer]]''—a role that Pacino had declined.<ref name="Grobel; p. xxiii"/>

During the 1970s, Pacino had four Oscar nominations for Best Actor, for his performances in ''Serpico'', ''The Godfather Part II'', ''Dog Day Afternoon'', and ''...And Justice for All''.<ref name="actors" />

===1980s===
Pacino's career slumped in the early 1980s; his appearances in the controversial ''[[Cruising (film)|Cruising]]'', a film that provoked protests from New York's gay community,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2007-08-28/film/gay-old-time/ |title=Gay Old Time|last=Lee|first=Nathan|date=August 27, 2007|work=[[The Village Voice]]|accessdate=July 26, 2010 |location=New York }}</ref> and the comedy-drama ''[[Author! Author! (film)|Author! Author!]]'', were critically panned.<ref name="biochannel" /> However, 1983's ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', directed by [[Brian De Palma]], proved to be a career highlight and a defining role.<ref name="actors" /> Upon its initial release, the film was critically panned due to violent content, but later received critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1859898,00.html|title=Scarface Nation|last=Snyder|first=S.

In 1985, Pacino worked on his personal project, ''[[The Local Stigmatic]]'', a 1969 [[Off Broadway]] play by the English writer [[Heathcote Williams]]. He starred in the play, remounting it with director David Wheeler and the Theater Company of Boston in a 50-minute film version. The film was not released theatrically, but was later released as part of the ''Pacino: An Actor's Vision'' box set in 2007.<ref name="actors" />

His 1985 film ''[[Revolution (1985 film)|Revolution]]'' about a fur trapper during the [[American Revolutionary War]], was a commercial and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production,<ref>Grobel; p. xiv</ref> resulting in a four-year hiatus from films. At this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of ''Crystal Clear'', ''National Anthems'' and other plays; he appeared in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' in 1988 in producer [[Joseph Papp]]'s [[New York Shakespeare Festival]]. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: "I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing ''[[The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui]]'' on stage and reading that the reason I'd gone back to the stage was that my movie career was waning! That's been the kind of ethos, the way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately."<ref>{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Lovece |title=Pacino re-focuses on film career: After five-year absence, actor returns to the big screen |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-17/entertainment/ca-518_1_al-pacino |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 17, 1989 |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Frank |last=Lovece |title=Pacino re-focuses on film career: After five-year absence, actor returns to the big screen (p. 2) |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-17/entertainment/ca-518_1_al-pacino/2 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 17, 1989 |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref> Pacino returned to film in 1989's ''[[Sea of Love (film)|Sea of Love]]'',<ref name="actors" /> when he portrayed a detective hunting a [[serial killer]] who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper.

===1990s===
[[File:Al Pacino Cannes 1996.jpg|thumb|left|Al Pacino at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]].|265x265px]]
Pacino received an Academy Award nomination for playing [[Big Boy Caprice]] in the box office hit ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' in 1990, of which critic [[Roger Ebert]] described Pacino as "the scene-stealer".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900615/REVIEWS/6150301/1023 |title=Dick Tracy Review |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=June 15, 1990|author=Roger Ebert}}</ref> Later in the year he followed this up in a return to one of his most famous characters, Michael Corleone, in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990).<ref name="actors" /> The film received mixed reviews, and had problems in pre-production due to script rewrites and the withdrawal of actors shortly before production.

In 1991, Pacino starred in ''[[Frankie and Johnny (1991 film)|Frankie and Johnny]]'' with [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who co-starred with Pacino in ''Scarface''.
