{{History of Austria|width=315px}}

The '''Austrian Empire''' ({{lang-de-AT|Kaiserthum Oesterreich}}, modern spelling ''{{lang|de|Kaisertum Österreich}}'') was an [[empire]] in [[Central Europe]] created out of the [[Habsburg Monarchy|realms of the Habsburgs]] by proclamation in 1804.  It was a multinational empire and one of Europe's [[great powers]].  Geographically it was the second largest country in Europe after the [[Russian Empire]] (621,538 square kilometres [239,977 sq mi]).  It was also the third most populous after Russia and France, as well as the largest and strongest country in the [[German Confederation]]. Proclaimed in response to the [[First French Empire]], it overlapped with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the latter's dissolution in 1806. The ''[[Ausgleich]]'' of 1867 elevated Hungary's status. It became a separate entity from the Empire entirely, joining with it in the dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]].

==History==

===Foundation===
{{See also|Imperial and Royal Army during the Napoleonic Wars}}
Changes shaping the nature of the Holy Roman Empire took place during conferences in [[Rastatt]] (1797–1799) and [[Regensburg]] (1801–1803). On 24 March 1803, the [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss|Imperial Recess]] ({{lang-de|Reichsdeputationshauptschluss}}) was declared, which reduced the number of [[ecclesiastical state]]s from 81 to only 3 and the [[free imperial city|free imperial cities]] from 51 to 6. This measure was aimed at replacing the old constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, but the actual consequence of the Imperial Recess was the end of the empire. Taking this significant change into consideration, the German Emperor Francis II created the title Emperor of Austria, for himself and his successors.

In 1804 the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Francis II, who was also ruler of the lands of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], founded the Empire of Austria, in which all his lands were included. In doing so he created a formal overarching structure for the Habsburg Monarchy, which had functioned as a [[composite monarchy]] for about three hundred years. He did so because he foresaw either the end of the Holy Roman Empire, or the eventual accession as Holy Roman Emperor of [[Napoleon]], who had earlier that year adopted the title of an Emperor of the French; Francis II eventually abandoned the title of German-Roman Emperor later in 1806. To safeguard his dynasty's imperial status he adopted the additional hereditary title of [[Emperor of Austria]]. Apart from now being included in a new "[[Kaiserthum]]", the workings of the overarching structure and the status of its component lands at first stayed much the same as they had been under the composite monarchy that existed before 1804. This was especially demonstrated by the status of the Kingdom of Hungary, a country which had always been considered a separate realm—a status that was affirmed by Article X, which was added to Hungary's constitution in 1790 during the phase of the composite monarchy and described the state as a ''Regnum Independens''. Hungary's affairs remained administered by its own institutions (King and Diet) as they had been beforehand. Thus under the new arrangements no Imperial institutions were involved in its internal government.<ref>{{Citation|last=Laszlo|first=Péter|title=Hungary's Long Nineteenth Century: Constitutional and Democratic Traditions |publisher= Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, the Netherlands |year=2011|page=6 |quote=From the perspective of the Court since 1723, regnum Hungariae had been a hereditary province of the dynasty's three main branches on both lines. From the perspective of the ország, Hungary was regnum independens, a separate Land as Article X of 1790 stipulated …….. In 1804 Emperor Franz assumed the title of Emperor of Austria for all the Erblande of the dynasty and for the other Lands, including Hungary. Thus Hungary formally became part of the Empire of Austria. The Court reassured the diet, however, that the assumption of the monarch's new title did not in any sense affect the laws and the constitution of Hungary}}</ref><ref>"Vor dem Jahr 1848 is[t] das Kaisertum Österreich verfassungsrechtlich als ein monarchischer Einheitsstaat auf differenziert föderalistischer Grundlage zu sehen, wobei die besondere Stel[l]ung Ungarns im Rahmen dieses Gesamtstaates stets offenkundig war. Eine weitere Differenzierung der föderalistischen Grundlage erfolgte ab 1815 durch die Zugehörigkeit eines teiles des Kaisertums zum Deutschen Bund." "Before 1848 the Austrian Empire can be regarded in constitutional law as a unitary monarchy on a differentiated federalistic basis, whereby the special position of Hungary within the framework of this united state was always evident. A further differentiation of the federalistic position followed from 1815 through the affiliation of a part of the empire to the German federation."{{Citation|last=Zeilner|first=Franz|title=Verfassung, Verfassungsrecht und Lehre des Öffentlichen Rechts in Österreich bis 1848: Eine Darstellung der materiellen und formellen Verfassungssituation und der Lehre des öffentlichen Rechts |publisher= Lang, Frankfurt am Main|year=2008|page=45}}</ref><ref>József Zachar, [http://tortenelemszak.elte.hu/data/23763/ZacharJozsef.pdf Austerlitz, 1805. december 2.  A három császár csatája – magyar szemmel], In: Eszmék, forradalmak, háborúk. Vadász Sándor 80 éves, ELTE, Budapest, 2010 p. 557</ref> Austria and some parts of the Holy Roman Empire then took the field against France and its German allies during the [[Third Coalition]] which led to its crushing defeat at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] in early December 1805. By the 4th of that same month, a ceasefire was in place and peace talks were being conducted nearby.

The fall and dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire was accelerated by French intervention in the Empire in September 1805. On 20 October 1805, an Austrian army led by general [[Karl Mack von Leiberich]] was defeated by French armies near the town of [[Ulm]]. The French victory resulted in the capture of 20,000 Austrian soldiers and many cannons. Napoleon's army won another victory at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] on 2 December 1805. Francis was forced into negotiations with the French from 4 to 6 December 1805, which concluded with an armistice on 6 December 1805.

The French victories encouraged rulers of certain imperial territories to assert their formal independence from the Empire. On 10 December 1805, the [[prince-elector]] Duke of Bavaria proclaimed himself King, followed by the elector Duke of Württemberg on 11 December. Finally, on 12 December, the [[Margrave]] of [[Baden]] was given the title of [[Grand Duke]]. In addition, each of these new countries signed a treaty with France and became [[French client republic|French allies]]. The Treaty of Pressburg between France and Austria, signed in Pressburg (today [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]) on 26 December, enlarged the territory of Napoleon's German allies at the expense of defeated Austria.

Francis II agreed to the humiliating [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] (26 December 1805), which in practice meant the dissolution of the long-lived [[Holy Roman Empire]] and a reorganization under a Napoleonic imprint of the German territories lost in the process into a precursor state of what became [[Germany#Modern Germany|modern Germany]], those possessions nominally having been part of the Holy Roman Empire within the present boundaries of Germany, as well as other measures weakening Austria and the Habsburgs in other ways. Certain Austrian holdings in Germany were passed to French allies—the [[King of Bavaria]], the [[King of Württemberg]] and the [[Elector of Baden]]. Austrian claims on those German states were renounced without exception.

On 12 July 1806, the Confederation of the Rhine was established, comprising 16 sovereigns and countries. This confederation, under French influence, put an end to the Holy Roman Empire. On 6 August 1806, even Francis recognized the new state of things and proclaimed the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire.

One consequence was that eight months later, on 6 August 1806, Francis II dissolved the Holy Roman Empire, due to the formation of the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] by France, as he did not want Napoleon to succeed him. This action was unrecognized by [[George III of the United Kingdom]] who was also the [[Prince-elector|Elector]] of Hanover and had also lost his German territories around [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Hanover]] to Napoleon. His claims were later settled by the creation of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]] which was held by George's British heirs until [[Queen Victoria]]'s accession, when it split into the British and Hanoverian royal families.

===Metternich Era===
[[File:Metternich Klemens Fst.jpg|thumb|right|Metternich in later years]]

[[Klemens von Metternich]] became Foreign Minister in 1809. He also held the post of Chancellor of State from 1821 until 1848, under both [[Francis I of Austria|Francis I]] and his son [[Ferdinand I of Austria|Ferdinand I]]. The period of 1815-1848 is also referred to as the "Age of Metternich".<ref name="Sked, Alan 1918">Sked, Alan. The Decline and Fall of the Habsburg Empire, 1815-1918. London: Longman, 1989. Print.</ref> During this period, Metternich controlled the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]'s foreign policy. He also had a major influence in European politics. He was known for his strong conservative views and approach in politics. Metternich's policies were strongly against revolution and liberalism.<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1918">Jelavich, Barbara. The Habsburg Empire in European Affairs: 1814-1918. Chicago: Rand Mcnally, 1969. Print.</ref> In his opinion, liberalism was a form of legalized revolution.<ref>Tuncer, Huner.

Metternich was a practitioner of balance-of-power diplomacy.<ref name="Sofka, James R 1998">Sofka, James R. "Metternich's Theory of European Order: A Political Agenda for 'Perpetual Peace'." ''The Review of Politics'' 60.01 (1998): 115. Web.</ref> His foreign policy aimed to maintain international political equilibrium to preserve the Habsburgs' power and influence in international affairs. Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Metternich was the chief architect of the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815.<ref name="Sofka, James R 1998"/> The Austrian Empire was the main beneficiary from the Congress of Vienna and it established an alliance with [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Prussia]], and [[Russia]] forming the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|Quadruple Alliance]].<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1918"/> The Austrian Empire also gained new territories from the Congress of Vienna, and its influence expanded to the north through the [[German Confederation]] and also into [[Italy]].<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1918"/> Due to the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Austria was the leading member of the German Confederation.<ref name="Mueller-1961"/> Following the Congress, the major European powers agreed to meet and discuss resolutions in the event of future disputes or revolutions. Because of Metternich's main role in the architecture of the Congress, these meetings are also referred to as the "Metternich congress" or "Metternich system". While Metternich was the Austrian foreign minister, other congresses would meet to resolve European foreign affairs. These included the Congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818), Carlsbad (1819), Troppau (1820), Laibach (1821), and Verona (1822).<ref name="Sked, Alan 1918"/> The Metternich congresses aimed to maintain the political equilibrium among the European powers and prevent revolutionary efforts. These meetings also aimed to resolve foreign issues and disputes without resorting to violence. By means of these meetings and by allying the Austrian Empire with other European powers whose monarchs had a similar interest in preserving conservative political direction, Metternich was able to establish the Austrian Empire's influence on European politics. Also, because Metternich used the fear of revolutions among European powers, which he also shared, he was able to establish security and predominance of the Habsburgs in Europe.<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1918"/>

Under Metternich, [[nationalism|nationalist]] revolts in Austrian north Italy and the German states were forcibly crushed. At home, he pursued a similar policy to suppress revolutionary and liberal ideals. He employed the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819, which used strict [[censorship]] of education, press and speech to repress revolutionary and liberal concepts.<ref name="Sked, Alan 1918"/> Metternich also used a wide-ranging spy network to dampen down unrest.

Metternich operated very freely with regard to foreign policy under Emperor Francis I's reign. Francis died in 1835. This date marks the decline of Metternich's influence in the Austrian Empire. Francis' heir was his son Ferdinand I, but he suffered from an intellectual disability.<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1918"/> Ferdinand's accession preserved the Habsburg dynastic succession, but he was not capable of ruling.<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1918"/> The leadership of the Austrian Empire was transferred to a state council composed of Metternich, Francis I's brother Archduke Louis, and Count Anton Kolowrat. The liberal [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]] forced Metternich's resignation. Metternich is remembered for his success in maintaining the status quo and the Habsburg influence in international affairs.<ref name="Sked, Alan 1918"/> No Habsburg foreign minister following Metternich held a similar position within the empire for such a long time nor held such a vast influence on European foreign affairs.<ref name="Jelavich, Barbara 1918"/>

Historians often remember the Metternich era as a period of stagnation: the Austrian Empire fought no wars nor did it undergo any radical internal reforms.<ref name="Crankshaw, Edward 1963">Crankshaw, Edward. The Fall of the House of Habsburg. New York: Viking, 1963. Print.</ref> However, it was also thought of as period of economic growth and prosperity in the Austrian Empire.<ref name="Crankshaw, Edward 1963"/> The population of Austria rose to 37.5 million by 1843. Urban expansion also occurred and the population of Vienna reached 400,000. During the Metternich era, the Austrian Empire also maintained a stable economy and reached an almost balanced budget, despite having a major deficit following the Napoleonic Wars.<ref>"History of Austria, Austria in the Age of Metternich."

===Revolutions of 1848===
{{main|Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire}}

From March 1848 through November 1849, the Empire was threatened by revolutionary movements, most of which were of a nationalist character. Besides that, liberal and even socialist currents resisted the empire's longstanding conservatism. Ultimately, the revolutions failed, in part because the various revolutionaries had conflicting goals.

===The Bach years===

After the death of [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg]] in 1852, the Minister of the Interior [[Baron Alexander von Bach]] largely dictated policy in Austria and Hungary. Bach centralized administrative authority for the Austrian Empire, but he also endorsed [[reactionary]] policies that reduced [[freedom of the press]] and abandoned public trials. He later represented the [[Enlightened absolutism|Absolutist]] (or ''Klerikalabsolutist'') direction, which culminated in the concordat of August 1855 that gave the [[Roman Catholic Church]] control over education and family life. This period in the history of the Austrian Empire would become known as the era of '''neo-absolutism''', or '''Bach's absolutism'''.

The pillars of the so-called '''Bach system''' (''Bachsches System'') were, in the words of [[Adolf Fischhof]], four "armies": ''a standing army of soldiers, a sitting army of office holders, a kneeling army of priests and a fawning army of sneaks''.{{fact|date=February 2016}} Prisons were full of political prisoners: for example during his administration, [[Czechs|Czech]] nationalist journalist and writer [[Karel Havlíček Borovský]] was forcibly expatriated  (1851–1855) to [[Brixen]]. This exile undermined Borovský's health and he died soon afterwards. This affair earned Bach a very bad reputation amongst Czechs and subsequently led to the strengthening of the [[Czech National Revival|Czech national movement]].

However his relaxed ideological views (apart from that of preserving the monarchy) led to a great rise in the 1850s of [[economic freedom]]. Under him the internal [[Customs (tax)|customs]] duties were abolished, and peasants were emancipated from their feudal obligations.<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Bach, Alexander, Baron|year=1905}}</ref>

In her capacity as leader of the German Confederation, Austria participated with volunteers in the [[First War of Schleswig]] (1848 to 1850).<ref name="Mueller-1961">Handbook of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850–1864, by Edwin MUELLER, 1961.</ref>

[[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]] allied itself with [[France]] for the conquest of [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia|Lombardy–Venetia]]. Austria was defeated in the 1859 armed conflict. The Treaties of [[Treaty of Villafranca|Villafranca]] and [[Treaty of Zürich|Zürich]] removed Lombardy, except for the part east of the Mincio river, the so-called [[Mantovano]].<ref>Mueller 1961, Historical Data, p.H5.</ref>

===After 1859===

The [[February Patent|Constitution of 1861]] created a House of Lords ({{lang|de|Herrenhaus}}) and a House of Deputies ({{lang|de|Abgeordnetenhaus}}). But most nationalities of the monarchy remained dissatisfied.

After the second war with Denmark in 1864, Holstein came under Austrian, Schleswig and Lauenburg under Prussian administration. But the internal difficulties continued.<ref>Mueller 1961, p.H6.</ref> Diets replaced the parliament in 17 provinces, the [[Hungarian people|Hungarians]] pressed for autonomy, and Venetia was attracted by the now unified Italy.

After Austria was defeated in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the German Confederation was dissolved, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 was adopted. By this act, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Empire of Austria as two separate entities joined together on an equal basis to form the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary.

It should be noted that the frequent abbreviation [[K.u.K.]] (''Kaiserliche und Königliche'', "Imperial and Royal") does not refer to that dual monarchy but originated in 1745, when the "royal" part referred to the Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

==Foreign policy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}
The [[Napoleonic Wars]] dominated Austrian foreign policy from 1804 to 1815. The Austrian army was one of the most formidable forces the French had to face. After [[Prussia]] signed a peace treaty with France on 5 April 1795, Austria was forced to carry the main burden of war with [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] for almost ten years. This severely overburdened the Austrian economy, making the war greatly unpopular. Emperor Francis II therefore refused to join any further war against [[Napoleon]] for a long time. On the other hand, Francis II continued to intrigue for the possibility of revenge against France, entering into a secret military agreement with the Russian Empire in November 1804. This convention was to assure mutual cooperation in the case of a new war against France.

Austrian unwillingness to join the Third Coalition was overcome by [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] subsidies, but the Austrians withdrew from the war yet again after a decisive defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz. Although the Austrian [[budget]] suffered from wartime expenditures and its international position was significantly undermined, the humiliating Treaty of Pressburg provided plenty of time to strengthen the army and economy. Moreover, the ambitious [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]] and [[Johann Philipp von Stadion]] never abandoned the goal of further war with France.
[[File:Austrian Empire (1812).svg|thumb|left|215px|The Austrian Empire in 1812.]]
Archduke Charles of Austria served as the Head of the [[Council of War (Austria)|Council of War]] and Commander in Chief of the Austrian army. Endowed with the enlarged powers, he reformed the Austrian Army to preparedness for another war. Johann Philipp von Stadion, the foreign minister, personally hated Napoleon due to an experience of confiscation of his possessions in France by Napoleon. In addition, the third wife of Francis II, [[Marie Ludovika of Austria-Este]], agreed with Stadion's efforts to begin a new war. [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich]], located in Paris, called for careful advance in the case of the war against France. The defeat of French army at the [[Battle of Bailén]] in Spain on 27 July 1808 triggered the war. On 9 April 1809, an Austrian force of 170,000 men attacked [[Bavaria]].

Despite military defeats—especially the Battles of [[Battle of Marengo|Marengo]], [[Battle of Ulm|Ulm]], Austerlitz and [[Battle of Wagram|Wagram]]—and consequently lost territory throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (the Treaties of [[Treaty of Campo Formio|Campo Formio]] in 1797, [[Treaty of Luneville|Luneville]] in 1801, [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Pressburg]] in 1806, and [[Treaty of Schönbrunn|Schönbrunn]] in 1809), Austria played a decisive part in the overthrow of Napoleon in the campaigns of 1813–14. It participated (though modestly) in a second invasion of France in 1815, and put an end to Murat's regime in south Italy.

The latter period of Napoleonic Wars featured [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Metternich]] exerting a large degree of influence over foreign policy in the Austrian Empire, a matter nominally decided by the Emperor. Metternich initially supported an alliance with France, arranging the marriage between Napoleon and the Francis II's daughter, Marie-Louise; however, by the 1812 campaign, he had realised the inevitability of Napoleon's downfall and took Austria to war against France. Metternich's influence at the [[Congress of Vienna]] was remarkable, and he became not only the premier statesman in Europe but virtual ruler of the Empire until 1848—the [[Revolutions of 1848|Year of Revolutions]]—and the rise of [[liberalism]] equated to his political downfall. The result was that the Austrian Empire was seen as one of the great powers after 1815, but also as a reactionary force and an obstacle to national aspirations in Italy and Germany.
