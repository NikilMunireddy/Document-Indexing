The '''Atlanta Braves''' are an American [[professional baseball]] franchise based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] since 1966.  The team originated in [[Boston]] and played for many decades there before playing in [[Milwaukee]] for a little more than a decade. The franchise is a member of the [[National League East|East]] division of the [[National League]] (NL) in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). The Braves have played home games at [[Turner Field]] since 1997, and play [[spring training]] games in [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]]. In 2017, the team is to move to [[SunTrust Park]], a new stadium complex in the [[Cumberland, Georgia|Cumberland]] district of [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb County]] just north of the I-285 bypass.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowman|first=Mark|title=Braves leaving Turner Field for Cobb County|url=http://m.braves.mlb.com/news/article/63830416/|publisher=Atlanta Braves|work=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}</ref>

The "Braves" name, which was first used in 1912, originates from a term for an Indian warrior. They are [[List of baseball nicknames|nicknamed]] "the ''Bravos''", and often referred to as "[[America's Team#Other uses|America's Team]]" in reference to the team's games being broadcast on the nationally available [[Braves TBS Baseball|TBS]] from the 1970s until 2007, giving the team a nationwide fan base.

From 1991 to 2005 the Braves were one of the most successful franchises in baseball, winning division titles an unprecedented 14 consecutive times in that period<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20060920&content_id=1673160&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Yanks celebrate ninth straight East title |accessdate=July 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060913&content_id=1659755&vkey=news_atl&fext=.jsp&c_id=atl "Braves have set lofty benchmark"]. MLB.com, September 13, 2006.</ref> (omitting the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] 1994 season in which there were no official division champions). The Braves won the NL West 1991–93 and the NL East 1995–2005, and they returned to the playoffs as the [[Major League Baseball wild card|National League Wild Card]] in 2010. The Braves advanced to the [[World Series]] five times in the 1990s, winning the title in 1995. Since their debut in the National League in 1876, the franchise has won 16 divisional titles, 17 [[National League Championship Series|National League]] [[Pennant (sports)|pennants]], and three World Series championships—in [[1914 World Series|1914]] as the Boston Braves, in [[1957 World Series|1957]] as the Milwaukee Braves, and in [[1995 World Series|1995]] in Atlanta. The Braves are the only Major League Baseball franchise to have won the World Series in three different home cities.

The club is one of the National League's two remaining charter franchises (the other being the [[Chicago Cubs]]) and was founded in [[Boston]] in 1871 as the '''Boston Red Stockings''' (not to be confused with the American League's [[Boston Red Sox]]). They are considered "the oldest continuously playing team in [[Major professional sports teams of the United States and Canada|major North American sports]]."<ref name="BravesHistory">{{cite web|title=Story of the Braves|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/history/story_of_the_braves.jsp|publisher=Atlanta Braves|date=November 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151030062629/http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/history/story_of_the_braves.jsp|archivedate=October 30, 2015|accessdate=November 1, 2015|deadurl=no}}</ref>  There is an argument as to which team is actually older, because, although the Cubs are a full season "older" (formed as the Chicago White Stockings in 1870), Chicago did not sponsor a White Stockings team for two seasons due to the [[Great Chicago Fire]]; therefore, the Braves have played more consecutive seasons.

After various name changes, the team eventually began operating as the '''Boston Braves''', which lasted for most of the first half of the 20th century. Then, in 1953, the team moved to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and became the '''Milwaukee Braves''', followed by the final move to Atlanta in 1966. The team's tenure in Atlanta is noted for [[Hank Aaron]] breaking [[Babe Ruth]]'s career home run record in 1974.

====1870–1913====
[[File:1873Bostonteampicture.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1873 Boston Red Stockings team picture; it finished first with a record of 43–16]]

The [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]], established in 1869 as the first openly all-professional baseball team, voted to dissolve after the 1870 season. Player-manager [[Harry Wright]], with brother [[George Wright (sportsman)|George]] and two other Cincinnati players, then went to Boston, Massachusetts at the invitation of Boston Red Stockings founder [[Ivers Whitney Adams]] to form the nucleus of the ''Boston Red Stockings'', a charter member of the [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]] (NAPBBP). The original Boston Red Stockings team and its successors can lay claim to being the oldest continuously playing team in American professional sports.<ref name="BravesHistory" /> (The only other team that has been organized as long, the [[Chicago Cubs]], did not play for the two years following the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871.) Two young players hired away from the [[Rockford Forest Citys|Forest City club]] of [[Rockford, Illinois]], turned out to be the biggest stars during the NAPBBP years: pitcher [[Albert Spalding|Al Spalding]] (founder of [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods) and second baseman [[Ross Barnes]].

Led by the Wright brothers, Barnes, and Spalding, the Red Stockings dominated the National Association, winning four of that league's five championships. The team became one of the National League's charter franchises in 1876, sometimes called the "''Red Caps''" (as a new Cincinnati Red Stockings club was another charter member). Boston came to be called the ''Beaneaters'' in 1883, while retaining red as the team color.

The Boston Red Caps played in the first game in the history of [[Major League Baseball#Founding|the National League]], on Saturday, April 22, [[1876 in baseball|1876]], defeating the [[Philadelphia Athletics (1860–76)|Athletics]], 6-5.<ref>[http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1876/04221876.htm Events of Saturday, April 22, 1876].

[[File:Hugh Duffy Baseball.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hugh Duffy]] played with the franchise from 1892–1900 and won the third [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] in MLB history]]
Although somewhat stripped of talent in the National League's inaugural year, Boston bounced back to win the 1877 and 1878 pennants. The Red Caps/Beaneaters were one of the league's dominant teams during the 19th century, winning a total of eight pennants. For most of that time, their [[manager (baseball)|manager]] was [[Frank Selee]]. The [[1898 Boston Beaneaters season|1898 team]] finished 102–47, a club record for wins that would stand for [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|almost a century]]. Stars of those 1890s Beaneater teams included the "Heavenly Twins", [[Hugh Duffy]] and [[Tommy McCarthy]], as well as "Slidin'" [[Billy Hamilton (baseball, born 1866)|Billy Hamilton]].

The team was decimated when the [[American League]]'s new Boston entry set up shop in 1901. Many of the Beaneaters' stars jumped to the new team, which offered contracts that the Beaneaters' owners did not even bother to match. They only managed one winning season from 1900 to 1913, and lost 100 games five times. In 1907, the Beaneaters (temporarily) eliminated the last bit of red from their stockings because their manager thought the red dye could cause wounds to become infected (as noted in ''The Sporting News Baseball Guide'' during the 1940s when each team's entry had a [[History of baseball team nicknames|history of its nickname(s)]].  The American League club's owner, Charles Taylor, wasted little time in adopting [[Boston Red Sox|Red Sox]] as his team's first official nickname (up to that point they had been called by the generic "Americans"). Media-driven nickname changes to the ''Doves'' in 1907 and the ''Rustlers'' in 1911 did nothing to change the National League club's luck. The team became the ''Braves'' for the first time in 1912. Their owner, [[James E. Gaffney|James Gaffney]], was a member of New York City's political machine, [[Tammany Hall]], which used an Indian chief as their symbol.<ref>Kaese, Harold ''The Boston Braves'', Northeaster University Press, 1948.</ref>

====1914: Miracle====
{{Main|1914 Boston Braves season}}

Two years later, the Braves put together one of the most memorable seasons in baseball history. After a dismal 4–18 start, the Braves seemed to be on pace for a last place finish. On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the [[1914 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn Dodgers]]. The consecutive losses put their record at 26–40 and the Braves were in last place, ''15 games'' behind the league-leading [[1914 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], who had won the previous three league pennants. After a day off, the Braves started to put together a hot streak, and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41–12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1914&t=BSN |title=1914 Boston Braves Schedule by Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref> On September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three from the New York Giants and moved into first place. The Braves tore through September and early October, closing with 25 wins against six losses, while the Giants went 16–16.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1914&t=NY1 |title=1914 New York Giants Schedule by Baseball Almanac |publisher=Baseball-almanac.com |accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref> They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.<ref>Cohen, Neft, Johnson and Deutsch, ''The World Series'', The Dial Press, 1976.</ref>

[[File:Seattle Bill James.jpg|thumb|right|Starting pitcher [[Bill James (pitcher, born 1892)|Bill James]] was 2–0 in the [[1914 World Series]], and the Braves recorded the first sweep in World Series history]]
Despite their amazing comeback, the Braves entered the [[1914 World Series|World Series]] as a heavy underdog to [[Connie Mack]]'s [[1914 Philadelphia Athletics season|Philadelphia A's]]. Nevertheless, the Braves swept the Athletics—the first unqualified sweep in the young history of the modern [[World Series]] (the [[1907 World Series|1907 Series]] had one tied game) to win the world championship. Meanwhile, [[Johnny Evers]] won the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Chalmers Award]].

The Braves played the World Series (as well as the last few games of the 1914 season) at [[Fenway Park]], since their normal home, the [[South End Grounds]], was too small. However, the Braves' success inspired owner Gaffney to build a modern park, [[Braves Field]], which opened in August 1915. It was the largest park in the majors at the time, with 40,000 seats and a very spacious outfield. The park was novel for its time; public transportation brought fans right to the park.

====1915–1953====
After contending for most of 1915 and 1916, the Braves only twice posted winning records from 1917 to 1932. The lone highlight of those years came when Judge [[Emil Fuchs (baseball)|Emil Fuchs]] bought the team in 1923 to bring his longtime friend, pitching great [[Christy Mathewson]], back into the game. However, Mathewson died in 1925, leaving Fuchs in control of the team.

Fuchs was committed to building a winner, but the damage from the years prior to his arrival took some time to overcome. The Braves finally managed to be competitive in 1933 and 1934 under manager [[Bill McKechnie]], but Fuchs' revenue was severely depleted due to the [[Great Depression]].

Looking for a way to get more fans and more money, Fuchs worked out a deal with the [[New York Yankees]] to acquire [[Babe Ruth]], who had started his career with the Red Sox. Fuchs made Ruth team vice president, and promised him a share of the profits. He was also granted the title of assistant manager, and was to be consulted on all of the Braves' deals. Fuchs even suggested that Ruth, who had long had his heart set on managing, could take over as manager once McKechnie stepped down—perhaps as early as 1936.<ref name="Neyer">{{cite book|last=Neyer|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Neyer|title=Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Blunders|year=2006|publisher=Fireside|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7432-8491-2 }}</ref>

At first, it appeared that Ruth was the final piece the team needed in 1935. On opening day, he had a hand in all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 win over the [[1936 New York Giants (MLB) season|Giants]]. However, that proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 all year. Events went downhill quickly. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else. He could not run, and his fielding was so terrible that three of the Braves' pitchers threatened to go on strike if Ruth were in the lineup. It soon became obvious that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was hot air. In fact, Ruth discovered that Fuchs expected him to invest some of ''his'' money in the team.<ref name="Neyer"/>

Seeing a franchise in complete disarray, Ruth retired on June 1—only six days after he clouted what turned out to be the last three [[home run]]s of his career. He had wanted to quit as early as May 12, but Fuchs wanted him to hang on so he could play in every National League park.<ref name="Neyer"/> The Braves finished 38–115, the worst season in franchise history. Their .248 winning percentage is [[List of worst MLB season records|the third-worst in baseball history]], and the second-worst in National League history (behind only the [[1899 Cleveland Spiders season|1899 Cleveland Spiders]]).

Fuchs lost control of the team in August 1935,<ref name="Neyer"/> and the new owners tried to change the team's image by renaming it the ''Boston Bees''. This did little to change the team's fortunes. After five uneven years, a new owner, construction magnate [[Lou Perini]], changed the nickname back to the Braves. He immediately set about rebuilding the team. World War II slowed things down a little, but the team rode the pitching of [[Warren Spahn]] to impressive seasons in 1946 and 1947.

[[File:Johnny Sain and Warren Spahn.png|thumb|Spahn (right) with [[Johnny Sain]]]]
In 1948, the [[1948 Boston Braves season|team]] won the pennant, behind the pitching of Spahn and [[Johnny Sain]], who won 39 games between them. The remainder of the rotation was so thin that in September, ''Boston Post'' writer Gerald Hern wrote this poem about the pair:

:''First we'll use Spahn''
:''then we'll use Sain''
:''Then an off day''
:''followed by rain''
:''Back will come Spahn''
:''followed by Sain''
:''And followed''
:''we hope''
:''by two days of rain.''

The poem received such a wide audience that the sentiment, usually now paraphrased as ''"Spahn and Sain and pray for rain"'', entered the baseball vocabulary. However, in the 1948 season, the Braves actually had the same record in games that Spahn and Sain started that the team had overall, in terms of winning percentage.

The [[1948 World Series]], which the Braves lost in six games to the [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]], turned out to be the Braves' last hurrah in Boston.  In 1950, [[Sam Jethroe]] became the team's first African American player, making his major league debut on April 18. Amid four mediocre seasons, attendance steadily dwindled until, on March 13, 1953, Perini, who had recently bought out his original partners, announced he was moving the team to [[Milwaukee]], where the Braves had their top farm club, the [[Milwaukee Brewers minor league|Brewers]]. Milwaukee had long been a possible target for relocation. [[Bill Veeck]] had tried to return his [[Saint Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] there earlier the same year (Milwaukee was the original home of that franchise), but his proposal had been voted down by the other American League owners.

===Milwaukee (1953–1965)===
{{see also|History of the Atlanta Braves#Milwaukee}}

Milwaukee went wild over the Braves, who were welcomed as genuine heroes. The Braves finished 92–62 in their first season in Milwaukee, and drew a then-NL record 1.8&nbsp;million fans. The success of the team was noted by many owners. Not coincidentally, the [[Philadelphia Athletics]], [[Saint Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]], [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], and [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] would leave their original hometowns within the next five years.

[[File:MilwaukeeBaseballM.svg|thumb|left|upright=0.65|Milwaukee Braves cap logo]]
As the 1950s progressed, the reinvigorated Braves became increasingly competitive. Sluggers [[Eddie Mathews]] and [[Hank Aaron]] drove the offense (they would hit a combined 1,226 home runs as Braves, with 850 of those coming while the franchise was in Milwaukee), often aided by another power hitter, [[Joe Adcock]], while [[Warren Spahn]], [[Lew Burdette]], and [[Bob Buhl]] anchored the rotation. The 1956 Braves finished second, only one game behind the Brooklyn Dodgers.

In [[1957 Milwaukee Braves season|1957]], the Braves celebrated their first pennant in nine years spearheaded by Aaron's [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|MVP season]], as he led the National League in home runs and RBI. Perhaps the most memorable of his 44 round-trippers that season came on September 23, a two-run [[walk-off home run]] that gave the Braves a 4–2 victory over the [[1957 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] and clinched the League championship. The team then went on to its first [[World Series]] win in over 40 years, defeating the powerful [[1957 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] of [[Yogi Berra|Berra]], [[Mickey Mantle|Mantle]], and [[Whitey Ford|Ford]] in seven games. One-time Yankee Burdette, the Series MVP, threw three complete game victories against his former team, giving up only two earned runs.

In [[1958 Milwaukee Braves season|1958]], the Braves again won the National League pennant and jumped out to a three games to one lead in the World Series against the [[1958 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] once more, thanks in part to the strength of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching. But the Yankees stormed back to take the last three games, in large part to World Series MVP [[Bob Turley]]'s pitching.

The [[1959 Milwaukee Braves season|1959 season]] saw the Braves finish the season in a tie with the [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]], both with 86-68 records. Many residents of Chicago and Milwaukee were hoping for a Sox-Braves Series, as the cities are only about {{convert|75|mi|km|0}} apart, but it was not to be because Milwaukee fell in a best-of-3 playoff with two straight losses to the Dodgers. The Dodgers would go on to defeat the [[1959 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[1959 World Series|World Series]].

[[File:MilwaukeeBraves5461.png|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Milwaukee Braves logo (1953–1956)]]
The next six years were up-and-down for the Braves. The 1960 season featured two no-hitters by Burdette and Spahn, and Milwaukee finished seven games behind the [[1960 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]], who ultimately were to win the [[1960 World Series|World Series]] that year, in second place, one year after the Braves were on the winning end of the 13-inning near-perfect game of Pirates pitcher [[Harvey Haddix]]. The 1961 season saw a drop in the standings for the Braves down to fourth, despite Spahn recording his 300th victory and pitching another no-hitter that year.

Aaron hit 45 [[home run]]s in 1962, a Milwaukee career high for him, but this did not translate into wins for the Braves, as they finished fifth. [[1963 in baseball|The next season]], Aaron again hit 44 home runs and notched 130 RBI, and Spahn was once again the ace of the staff, going 23–7. However, none of the other Braves produced at that level, and the team finished in the lower half of the league, or "[[first division (baseball)|second division]]", for the first time in its short history in Milwaukee.

The Braves were somewhat mediocre as the 1960s began, but fattened up on the expansion [[New York Mets]] and [[Houston Colt .45s]]. To this day, the Milwaukee Braves are the only major league team who played more than one season and never had a losing record.

Perini sold the Braves to a Chicago-based group led by [[William Bartholomay]] in 1962. Almost immediately Bartholomay started shopping the Braves to a larger television market. Keen to attract them, the fast-growing city of Atlanta, led by Mayor
[[Ivan Allen, Jr.]] constructed a new $18&nbsp;million, 52,000-seat ballpark in less than one year, [[Atlanta Stadium]], which was officially opened in 1965 in hopes of luring an existing major league baseball and/or NFL/AFL team. After the city failed to lure the [[Kansas City Athletics|Kansas City A's]] to Atlanta (the A's would move to Oakland in 1968), the Braves announced their intention to move to Atlanta for the 1965 season. However, an injunction filed in Wisconsin kept the Braves in Milwaukee for one final year. In 1966, the Braves completed the move to Atlanta.

[[Eddie Mathews]] is the only Braves player to have played for the organization in all three cities that they have been based in. Mathews played with the Braves for their last season in Boston, the team's entire tenure in Milwaukee, and their first season in Atlanta.

===Atlanta===

====1966–1974====
The Braves were a .500 team in their first few years in Atlanta; 85–77 in 1966, 77–85 in 1967, and 81–81 in 1968. The 1967 season was the Braves' first losing season since 1952, their last year in Boston. In 1969, with the onset of divisional play, the Braves won the first-ever [[National League West]] Division title, before being swept by the "[[1969 New York Mets season|Miracle Mets]]" in the [[1969 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. They would not be a factor during the next decade, posting only two winning seasons between 1970 and 1981 – in some cases, fielding teams as bad as the worst Boston teams.

[[File:Aaron 715.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The fence over which Hank Aaron hit his 715th career home run still exists outside of [[Turner Field]].]]
In the meantime, fans had to be satisfied with the achievements of [[Hank Aaron]]. In the relatively hitter-friendly confines and higher-than-average altitude of Atlanta Stadium ("The Launching Pad"), he actually increased his offensive production. Atlanta also produced batting champions in [[Rico Carty]] (in 1970) and [[Ralph Garr]] (in 1974). In the shadow of Aaron's historical home run pursuit, was the fact that three Atlanta sluggers hit 40 or more home runs in 1973 – [[Darrell Evans]], [[Davey Johnson]] and, of course, Aaron.

By the end of the 1973 season, Aaron had hit 713 home runs, one short of Ruth's record. Throughout the winter he received racially motivated death threats, but stood up well under the pressure. The [[1974 Major League Baseball season|next season]], it was only a matter of time before he set a new record. On April 4, opening day, he hit No.714 in [[1974 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]], and on April 8, in front of his home fans and a national television audience he finally beat Ruth's mark with a home run to left-center field off left-hander [[Al Downing (baseball)|Al Downing]] of the [[1974 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Aaron spent most of his career as a Milwaukee and Atlanta Brave before asking to be traded to the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], while Ruth finished his career as a Boston Brave. In fact, until [[Barry Bonds]] eclipsed the 714 home runs hit by [[Babe Ruth]] in 2006, the top two home run hitters in Major League history had at one time been Braves.

====1976–77: Ted Turner buys the team====
[[File:Международная Леонардо-премия 10.1.jpg|thumb|Media magnate [[Ted Turner]] purchased the team in 1976, and played a large role in the team's operation.]]

In 1976, the team was purchased by media magnate [[Ted Turner]], owner of [[superstation]] [[TBS (TV network)|WTBS]], as a means to keep the team (and one of his main programming staples) in Atlanta. The financially strapped Turner used money already paid to the team for their broadcast rights as a down-payment. It was then that Atlanta Stadium was renamed [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium]]. Turner quickly gained a reputation as a quirky, hands-on baseball owner. On May 11, 1977, Turner appointed himself [[manager (baseball)|manager]], but because MLB passed a rule in the 1950s barring managers from holding a financial stake in their teams, Turner was ordered to relinquish that position after one game (the [[1977 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] lost 2–1 to the [[1977 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] to bring their losing streak to 17 games).

Turner used the Braves as a major programming draw for his fledgling cable network, making the Braves the first franchise to have a nationwide audience and fan base. WTBS marketed the team as "The Atlanta Braves: [[America's Team]]", a nickname that still sticks in some areas of the country, especially [[Southern United States|the South]]. Among other things, in 1976 Turner suggested the nickname "Channel" for pitcher [[Andy Messersmith]] and jersey number 17, in order to promote the television station that aired [[Braves TBS Baseball|Braves games]]. Major League Baseball quickly nixed the idea.

====1978–1990====
[[File:PhilNierko1982.jpg|thumb|left|[[Phil Niekro]] played with the Braves from 1964–1983 and 1987; he holds the MLB record for most wins by a [[knuckleball]] pitcher]]

After three straight losing seasons, [[Bobby Cox]] was hired for his first stint as manager for the 1978 season. He promoted 22-year-old slugger [[Dale Murphy]] into the starting lineup. Murphy hit 77 home runs over the next three seasons, but he struggled on defense, unable to adeptly play either catcher or first base. In 1980, Murphy was moved to center field and demonstrated excellent range and throwing ability, while the Braves earned their first winning season since 1974. Cox was fired after the 1981 season and replaced with [[Joe Torre]], under whose leadership the Braves attained their first divisional title since 1969. Strong performances from [[Bob Horner]], [[Chris Chambliss]], pitcher [[Phil Niekro]], and short relief pitcher [[Gene Garber]] helped the Braves, but no Brave was more acclaimed than Murphy, who won both a [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] and a [[Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove award]]. Murphy also won an MVP award the following season, but the Braves began a period of decline that defined the team throughout the 1980s. Murphy, excelling in defense, hitting, and running, was consistently recognized as one of the league's best players, but the Braves averaged only 65 wins per season between 1985 and 1990. Their lowest point came in 1988, when they lost 106 games. The 1986 season saw the return of Bobby Cox as [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]]. Also in 1986, the team stopped using their Indian-themed mascot, [[Chief Noc-A-Homa]].

====1991–2004: Division dominance====

=====1991–1994=====

Cox returned to the dugout as manager in the middle of the 1990 season, replacing [[Russ Nixon]]. The Braves finished the year with the worst record in baseball, at 65–97. They traded Dale Murphy to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] after it was clear he was becoming a less dominant player. Pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]] began developing young pitchers [[Tom Glavine]], [[Steve Avery]], and [[John Smoltz]] into future stars. That same year, the Braves used the number one overall pick in the [[1990 Major League Baseball draft|1990 MLB draft]] to select [[Chipper Jones]], who became one of the best hitters in team history. Perhaps the Braves' most important move was not on the field, but in the front office. Immediately after the season, [[John Schuerholz]] was hired away from the [[Kansas City Royals]] as general manager.

The following season, Glavine, Avery, and Smoltz would be recognized as the best young pitchers in the league, winning 52 games among them. Meanwhile, behind position players [[David Justice]], [[Ron Gant]] and unexpected league Most Valuable Player and batting champion [[Terry Pendleton]], the [[1991 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] overcame a 39–40 start, winning 55 of their final 83 games over the last three months of the season and edging the [[1991 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] by one game in one of baseball's more memorable playoff races. The "Worst to First" Braves, who had not won a divisional title since 1982, captivated the city of Atlanta (and the entire southeast) during their improbable run to the flag. They defeated the [[1991 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in a very tightly contested seven-game [[1991 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] only to lose the [[1991 World Series|World Series]], also in seven games, to the [[1991 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]. The series, considered by many to be one of the greatest ever, was the first time a team that had finished last in its division one year went to the World Series the next; both the Twins and Braves accomplished the feat.

Despite the 1991 World Series loss, the Braves' success would continue. In 1992, the [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Braves]] returned to the [[1992 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] and once again defeated the [[1992 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates]] in seven games, culminating in a [[Francisco Cabrera game|dramatic game seven win]]. [[Francisco Cabrera (baseball)|Francisco Cabrera]]'s two-out single that scored [[David Justice]] and Sid Bream capped a three-run rally in the bottom of the ninth inning that gave the Braves a 3–2 victory. It was the first time in post season history that the tying and winning runs had scored on a single play in the ninth inning. The Braves lost the [[1992 World Series|World Series]] to the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]], however. In 1993, the Braves signed [[Cy Young Award]] winning pitcher [[Greg Maddux]] from the [[Chicago Cubs]], leading many baseball insiders to declare the team's pitching staff the best in baseball. The [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|1993 team]] posted a franchise-best 104 wins after a dramatic pennant race with the [[1993 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], who won 103 games. The Braves needed a stunning 55–19 finish to edge out the Giants, who led the Braves by nine games in the standings as late as August 11. However, the Braves fell in the [[1993 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] to the [[1993 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] in six games.

In 1994, in a realignment of the [[National League]]'s divisions following the 1993 expansion, the Braves moved to the Eastern Division.<ref name=Realignment/> This realignment was the main cause of the team's [[Braves–Mets rivalry|heated rivalry]] with the [[New York Mets]] during the mid-to-late 1990s.<ref name=RivalryWithMets/><ref name=SubwaySeries>{{cite book|title=The subway series: the Yankees, the Mets and a season to remember|year=2000|publisher=The Sporting News|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=978-0-89204-659-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=From Wild Card to World Series|date=October 17, 2000|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=New York Times|authorlink=Murray Chass}}</ref>

The [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|player's strike]] cut short the 1994 season, prior to the division championships, with the Braves six games behind the [[1994 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]] with 48 games left to play.

=====1995–2004=====
[[File:1995 World Series Braves Win.jpg|thumb|left|Braves celebrate their 1995 World Series victory, their third overall and first in Atlanta.]]

The Braves returned strong the following strike-shortened (144 games instead of the customary 162) year and beat the [[1995 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[1995 World Series]]. This squelched claims by many Braves critics that they were the "[[Buffalo Bills]] of Baseball" (January 1996 issue of ''Beckett [[Baseball Card]] Monthly''). With this World Series victory, the Braves became the first team in Major League Baseball to win world championships in three different cities. With their strong pitching as a constant, the Braves appeared in the {{World Series Year|1996}} and [[1999 World Series]] (losing both to the [[New York Yankees]], managed by [[Joe Torre]], a former Braves manager),<ref name=SubwaySeries/> and had a streak of division titles from 1991 to 2005 (three in the Western Division and eleven in the Eastern) interrupted only in 1994 when the strike ended the season early. Pitching was not the only constant in the Braves organization&nbsp;—Cox was the Braves' manager, while Schuerholz remained the team's GM until after the 2007 season when he was promoted to team president. Terry Pendleton finished his playing career elsewhere, but returned to the Braves system as the hitting coach.

In October 1996, Time Warner acquired Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System and all of its assets, including its cable channels and the Atlanta Braves.  Over the next few years, Ted Turner's presence as owner of the team would diminish.

[[File:1995 World Series trophy.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The [[1995 World Series]] [[Commissioner's Trophy (MLB)|Commissioner's Trophy]] on display in the [[Ivan Allen Jr. Braves Museum and Hall of Fame]] at [[Turner Field]]]]
A 95–67 record in {{World Series Year|2000}} produced a ninth consecutive division title. However, a sweep by the [[2000 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2000 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] prevented the Braves from reaching the [[2000 National League Championship Series|NL Championship Series]].<ref name=SubwaySeries/>

In 2001, Atlanta won the National League East division yet again, swept the [[Houston Astros]] in the NLDS, then lost to the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in the [[2001 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] four games to one. One memorable game the Braves played that year came on September 21, when they played [[Braves–Mets rivalry|rival]] [[New York Mets]] in the first major professional sporting event held in New York City since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].

In 2002, 2003 and 2004, the Braves won the Eastern division again, but lost in the NLDS in all three years in the same fashion: 3 games to 2 to the [[2002 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], [[2005 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]], and [[2006 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]].

=====Cy Young dominance=====
Six National League [[Cy Young Award]]s in the 1990s were awarded to three Braves pitchers:
* In 1991, left-handed pitcher [[Tom Glavine]] received his first award.
* Right-handed pitcher [[Greg Maddux]] won four in a row, three of them with the Braves from 1993 through 1995. His first award came in 1992 with the Cubs.
* In 1996, right-handed pitcher [[John Smoltz]] received his only Cy Young Award.
* In 1998, Glavine won his second.

====2005: A new generation====
{{Main|2005 Atlanta Braves season}}

In 2005, the Braves won the Division championship for the 14th consecutive time from 1991 to 2005. 14 consecutive division titles stands as the record for all major league baseball. The 2005 title marked the first time any MLB team made the postseason with more than 4 rookies who each had more than 100 ABs ([[Wilson Betemit]], [[Brian McCann (baseball)|Brian McCann]], [[Pete Orr]], [[Ryan Langerhans]], [[Jeff Francoeur]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Catcher Brian McCann, right fielder Jeff Francoeur, and pitcher [[Kyle Davies (baseball)|Kyle Davies]] all grew up in the suburbs of Atlanta. The large number of rookies to debut in 2005 were nicknamed the "Baby Braves" by fans and became an Atlanta-area sensation, helping to lead the club to a record of 90–72.

However, the season would end on a sour note as the Braves lost the [[2005 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] to the [[2005 Houston Astros season|Astros]] in four games. In Game 4, with the Braves leading by 5 in the eighth inning, the Astros battled back with a [[Lance Berkman]] [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] and a two-out, ninth inning [[Brad Ausmus]] home run off of Braves closer [[Kyle Farnsworth]]. The game did not end until the 18th inning, becoming the longest game in playoff history at 5 hours 50&nbsp;minutes. [[Chris Burke (baseball)|Chris Burke]] ended the marathon with a home run off of [[Joey Devine]].

After the 2005 season, the Braves lost their long-time pitching coach [[Leo Mazzone]], who left to go to the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. [[Roger McDowell]] took his place in the Atlanta dugout. Unable to re-sign shortstop [[Rafael Furcal]], the Braves acquired shortstop [[Edgar Rentería]] from the Boston Red Sox.

====2006: Struggles====
{{Main|2006 Atlanta Braves season}}
[[File:Andruw Jones.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andruw Jones]] at bat for the Braves in 2006]]

In 2006, the Braves did not perform at the level they had grown accustomed to. Due to an offensive slump, injuries to their starting rotation, and subpar bullpen performances, the Braves compiled a 6–21 record during June, the worst month ever in Atlanta with a winning percentage of .222; this was only better than the woeful [[1935 Boston Braves season|Boston Braves]] in May 1935 (4–20) with a .166 winning percentage.

The Braves made their move in July, going 14–10. However, the team remained in the bottom half of the NL East and trailed the [[2006 New York Mets season|Mets]] by a double-digit deficit for much of the season (13 games at the All-Star Break). However, despite their struggles, the Braves entered the break down by only 6½ games to the Dodgers for the NL Wild Card slot after winning seven of their last ten games.

After the break, the Braves came out with their bats swinging, setting many franchise records. They won five straight, sweeping the Padres and taking two from the Cardinals, tallying a total of 65 runs in that span. The 65 runs in five games is the best by the franchise since 1897, when the [[1897 Boston Beaneaters season|Boston Beaneaters]] totaled 78, including 25 in one game and 21 in another, from May 31 – June 3; the 2006 Braves also became the first team since the [[1930 New York Yankees season|1930 New York Yankees]] to score ten runs or more in five straight games. The Braves had a total of 81 hits during their five-game run and 98 hits in their last six games, going back to an 8–3 victory over [[2006 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] on July 9, the last game before the All-Star break. Additionally, Chipper Jones was able to maintain a 20-game hitting streak and tie [[Paul Waner]]'s 69-year-old Major League record with a 14-game extra-base hit streak.<ref>''The Sporting News Baseball Record Book'', 2007, p.&nbsp;29.</ref>

The Braves made their first trade of the season on July 20 to shore up the bullpen, sending Class A Rome catcher Max Ramirez to Cleveland for closer [[Bob Wickman]]. He served as the Braves' closer for the remainder of the season, taking over for an embattled [[Jorge Sosa]], who was subsequently traded on the July 31 trade deadline for St. Louis minor league pitcher Rich Scalamandre.

On July 29, the Braves traded reserve third baseman/shortstop [[Wilson Betemit]] to the Los Angeles Dodgers for reliever [[Danys Báez]] and infielder [[Willy Aybar]]. The move came on the night that starting third baseman Chipper Jones went on the 15-day [[disabled list]] with a strained oblique muscle. With Betemit gone, Atlanta called up infielder [[Tony Francisco Peña (baseball)|Tony Peña, Jr.]] from AAA Richmond to supplement Pete Orr.

Before the expansion of rosters on September 1, the Braves acquired [[Daryle Ward]] from the [[Washington Nationals]] for Class A Myrtle Beach pitcher [[Luis Atilano]], in hopes that he would be a valuable pinch-hitter in the postseason.

However, on September 18, the New York Mets' win over the [[2006 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL East, ending the Atlanta Braves' 11-year reign over the NL East. On September 24, the Braves' loss to the [[2006 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] mathematically eliminated the Braves from winning the NL Wild Card, making 2006 the first year that the Braves would not compete in the postseason since 1990, not counting the strike-shortened 1994 season.

Also, a loss to the Mets on September 28 guaranteed the Braves their first losing season since 1990. Although the Braves won two of their last three games against the Astros, including rookie [[Chuck James]] besting [[Roger Clemens]], Atlanta finished the season in third place, one game ahead of the Marlins, at 79–83.

After the season, the Atlanta coaching staff underwent a few changes. [[Brian Snitker]] became the third base coach after [[Fredi González]] left to become the manager for the Florida Marlins. [[Chino Cadahia]] replaced [[Pat Corrales]] as bench coach and former catcher [[Eddie Pérez (baseball)|Eddie Pérez]] became the new bullpen coach, replacing [[Bobby Dews]].

====Sale to Liberty Media====
In December 2005, team owner [[Time Warner]], who inherited the Braves after purchasing [[Turner Broadcasting System|TBS]] in 1996, announced it was placing the team for sale.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/09/23/MN70161.DTL|last=Pelline|first=Jeff|date=September 23, 1995|title=Time Warner Closes Deal for Turner|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/12/14/news/fortune500/braves_sale/|last=Isidore|first=Chris|date=December 14, 2005|title=Time Warner considers Braves sale|publisher=CNNMoney.com|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref> [[Liberty Media]] began negotiations to purchase the team.

In February 2007, after more than a year of negotiations, Time Warner agreed to a deal that would sell the Braves to [[Liberty Media|Liberty Media Group]] (a company which owned a large amount of stock in [[Time Warner|Time Warner, Inc.]]), pending approval by 75 percent of MLB owners and the Commissioner of Baseball, [[Bud Selig]]. The deal included the exchange of the Braves, valued in the deal at $450&nbsp;million, a hobbyist magazine publishing company, and $980&nbsp;million cash, for 68.5&nbsp;million shares of Time Warner stock held by Liberty Media, then worth approximately $1.48&nbsp;billion. Team President Terry McGuirk anticipated no change in the current front office structure, personnel, or day-to-day operations of the Braves. Liberty Media is not expected to take any type of "active" ownership in terms of day-to-day operations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0505/089.html?boxes=custom |title=Braves' New World – Forbes Magazine |work=Forbes |date=May 5, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |first=Monte |last=Burke}}</ref>

====2007: More struggles====
{{Main|2007 Atlanta Braves season}}
<!-- This section is intended as a summary of the entire season. Please do not add detailed information here. That should now go on the [[2007 Atlanta Braves season]] page, linked above. Thanks -->
[[File:BrianMcCann.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Brian McCann (baseball)|Brian McCann]] bats for Atlanta in July 2007]]

The Braves made their first moves by re-signing [[Bob Wickman]] to a one-year deal and picking up [[John Smoltz]]'s option in September 2006. They traded starting pitcher [[Horacio Ramírez]] to the [[Seattle Mariners]] for pitcher [[Rafael Soriano]], an American League reliever with a 2.20 ERA in 2006. They also denied arbitration to pitcher [[Chris Reitsma]] and second baseman [[Marcus Giles]]. The Braves signed utility-man [[Chris Woodward]] to fill a spot on the bench. The biggest trade in the offseason involved first baseman [[Adam LaRoche]] and a minor league player for [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] closer [[Mike González (pitcher)|Mike González]] and a minor league infielder, [[Brent Lillibridge]]. Gonzalez, who converted 24 of 24 save opportunities in 2006, joined Soriano as a set-up man for Wickman in the bullpen. The team then signed [[Craig Wilson (first baseman)|Craig Wilson]] to a one-year deal to platoon with [[Scott Thorman]]. The Braves also had solid relievers in [[Macay McBride]], [[Blaine Boyer]], and [[Tyler Yates]]. In addition, the majority of the Braves' offense, which was second in the NL in runs scored in 2006, returned in 2007. However, [[Mike Hampton]] was sidelined for the entire 2007 season with yet another surgery. Mike González was later sidelined for the season while recovering from Tommy John surgery.

The Braves' bullpen and offense came through in the clutch early on, helping the Braves to a 7–1 start, their best start since winning the World Series in 1995. The team finished April with a 16–9 record, but struggled during May, finishing 14–14. The Braves also struggled during [[interleague play]], finishing with an NL-worst 4–11 record. On June 24, the Braves fell to .500 for the first time in the 2007 season, but rebounded by winning the next 5 games.

On July 5, [[Chipper Jones]] surpassed Dale Murphy for the Atlanta club record of 372 home runs by belting two against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. On July 31, 2007, the Braves finalized the deal to acquire slugger first baseman [[Mark Teixeira]] and LHP [[Ron Mahay]] from the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for catcher [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]], SS [[Elvis Andrus]], and three minor-leaguers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070731&content_id=2119864&vkey=news_atl&fext=.jsp&c_id=atl |title=Braves finalize deal for slugger Teixeira |accessdate=July 31, 2007 |author=Mark Bowman |date=July 31, 2007 |publisher=MLB.com }}</ref> The Braves also acquired [[Octavio Dotel]] from the [[Kansas City Royals]] for [[Kyle Davies (baseball)|Kyle Davies]] and also traded LHP [[Wilfredo Ledezma]] and RHP [[Will Startup]] to the [[San Diego Padres]] for [[Royce Ring]]. On August 19, 2007 [[John Smoltz]] passed [[Phil Niekro]] for 1st place on the Braves' all-time strikeout list. Braves manager [[Bobby Cox]] broke the all-time MLB record for most career ejections by a manager in August 2007.<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070814&content_id=2148876&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb "Cox breaks all-time ejections record"]. MLB.com</ref>

After struggling during the second half of the 2007 season, Atlanta finished over .500 and missed the post season again. On October 12, 2007, [[John Schuerholz]] stepped down as General Manager to take over as team president.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/columnist/bodley/2007-10-11-schuerholz-comment_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=GM Schuerholz was Braves' guiding force | first=Hal | last=Bodley | date=October 12, 2007 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}</ref> Assistant GM [[Frank Wren]] took over as General Manager.

====2008: Plagued by injuries====
{{Main|2008 Atlanta Braves season}}

In December 2007, the team announced it would not re-sign center fielder [[Andruw Jones]] (who later would sign with the Dodgers).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/team/transactions.jsp?c_id=atl&year=2007&month=10 |title=Atlanta.braves.mlb.com |publisher=Atlanta.braves.mlb.com |accessdate=July 25, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110616125532/http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/team/transactions.jsp?c_id=atl&year=2007&month=10| archivedate= June 16, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Another major move was acquiring CF [[Gorkys Hernández]] and RHP [[Jair Jurrjens]] from the Detroit Tigers in exchange for SS [[Edgar Rentería]] and cash considerations.

The team's first new move for 2008 was acquiring OF [[Mark Kotsay]] from the A's (to replace Jones) in exchange for RHP [[Joey Devine]], RHP [[Jamie Richmond]] and cash considerations.

During the course of the offseason, the Braves signed veteran pitcher and former Brave [[Tom Glavine]], while losing long-time Brave [[John Smoltz]] to the [[Boston Red Sox]].

On February 25, 2009, just before the start of spring training, Atlanta agreed to terms on a one-year contract with free-agent outfielder [[Garret Anderson]]. The additional outfield depth allowed the Braves to trade [[Josh Anderson (baseball)|Josh Anderson]] to the Detroit Tigers for minor league pitcher [[Rudy Darrow]] on March 30, 2009.<ref>[http://detroit.tigers.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090330&content_id=4090204&vkey=pr_det&fext=.jsp&c_id=det "Tigers acquire Josh Anderson from Atlanta Braves"] MLB.com, March 30, 2009.</ref>

On June 3, 2009, the Braves acquired [[Nate McLouth]] from the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] for prospects [[Jeff Locke (baseball)|Jeff Locke]], [[Charlie Morton (pitcher)|Charlie Morton]] and [[Gorkys Hernández]]. They also released veteran pitcher Tom Glavine.  On July 10, 2009, the Braves traded outfielder [[Jeff Francoeur]] to the [[New York Mets]] for outfielder [[Ryan Church]]. On July 31, 2009, hours before the trade deadline, the Braves and Boston Red Sox swapped 1st basemen: Atlanta dealt [[Casey Kotchman]] to Boston and reacquired [[Adam LaRoche]], whom the Braves had traded away during the 2006–07 off-season to Pittsburgh.

The Braves made a late-season surge, coming within 2 games of the wild card leading [[2009 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] in late September. On October 1, 2009 with the Braves four games back, Colorado beat the [[2009 Milwaukee Brewers season|Milwaukee Brewers]] 9–2 to clinch the wild card spot and end the Braves' 2009 postseason hopes.

The 2010 Atlanta Braves Season features the Braves' attempt to reclaim a [[postseason]] berth for the first time since [[2005 Atlanta Braves season|2005]]. The Braves were once again skippered by [[Bobby Cox]], now in his 25th and final season managing the team. The Braves started the 2010 season slowly and had a nine-game losing streak in April. Then they had a nine-game winning streak from May 26 through June 3, the Braves longest since [[2000 Atlanta Braves season|2000]] when they won 16 in a row.

It was also announced that pitching coach [[Roger McDowell]], third-base coach [[Brian Snitker]], and bullpen coach [[Eddie Pérez (baseball)|Eddie Pérez]] would retain their current positions, while former hitting coach [[Terry Pendleton]] would replace [[Glenn Hubbard (baseball)|Glenn Hubbard]] as the first-base coach and newcomer [[Carlos Tosca]] would become the new bench coach. Hubbard and former bench coach [[Chino Cadahia]] were not offered positions on the new coaching staff. [[Larry Parrish]] was hired as hitting coach on October 29, 2010.

On November 16, 2010 in an offseason trade, the Braves acquired [[Dan Uggla]] from the Florida Marlins in exchange for left-handed reliever [[Mike Dunn (baseball)|Mike Dunn]] and infielder [[Omar Infante]]. According to [[Elias Sports Bureau]], the Braves had an all-time franchise win-loss record over .500 for the first time since 1923 after their win over the [[2011 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]] on June 11, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/elias?date=20110612 |title=ESPN – Elias Says: Sports Statistics – Stats from the Elias Sports Bureau – ESPN |publisher=ESPN  |accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref> The Braves franchise became the third franchise in MLB history to reach 10,000 wins with their win over the [[2011 Washington Nationals season|Washington Nationals]] on July 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajc.stats.com/mlb/recap.asp?g=310715115&final=true |title=MLB Game Recap – Nationals v Braves &#124; ajc.com |publisher=Ajc.stats.com |accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref> On July 31, 2011, just sixteen days after registering their 10,000th win, the [[2011 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] defeated the Braves by a score of 3-1, handing the team the 10,000th loss in franchise history.

Players from the Braves' farm system, such as [[Freddie Freeman]] and [[Brandon Beachy]], played regularly with the big league club, while [[Julio Teherán]], [[Randall Delgado]], and [[Mike Minor (baseball)|Mike Minor]] were called up for spot starts.

=====September collapse=====
The Braves led the [[List of National League Wild Card winners|National League Wild Card]] standings for much of the 2011 season, with the division-rival [[Philadelphia Phillies]] firmly in control of first place in the [[National League East]]. The Braves entered the final month of the regular season 25 games above .500 with a record of 80–55 and an {{frac|8|1|2}}-game lead in the Wild Card standings. The nearest team trailing them, the [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], who also trailed the [[National League Central]]-leading [[Milwaukee Brewers]] by {{frac|8|1|2}} games at the time, were considered a long-shot to gain a spot in the postseason. Just days prior on August 26, the Cardinals found themselves {{frac|10|1|2}} games behind and in third place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/7036470/latest-collapse-atlanta-braves-came-playoffs-time|title=Braves collapsed before playoffs|work=ESPN|date=29 September 2011}}</ref>

With 27 games to play, the Braves went 9–18 in September to finish the season with a record of 89–73. The Cardinals, meanwhile, went 18–8 to finish at 90–72. Braves closer [[Craig Kimbrel]], who had not surrendered a single earned run in July or August, carried a 4.76 ERA in September with three blown saves. After being dominant in his role for much of the season, Braves setup man [[Jonny Venters]] posted a 5.11 September ERA. These sharp declines in both relievers led many critics to question the handling of the bullpen by Braves manager [[Fredi González]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlbblogbuzz.com/anatomy-of-a-collapse-or-three/|title=Anatomy of a Collapse (Or Three)|work=MLB Blog Buzz|date=29 September 2011}}</ref> Veteran starter [[Derek Lowe]] posted a [[win-loss record]] of 0–5 in September with an ERA of 8.75.<ref name='AJC chronology'>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/atlanta-braves/chronology-of-braves-collapse-1192706.html|title=Chronology of Braves' collapse|work=AJC|date=1 October 2011}}</ref> Shortly into the offseason, Lowe would be traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20111031&content_id=25850284&vkey=news_atl&c_id=atl|title=Lowe dealt to Tribe for Minor League reliever|work=atlantabraves.com|date=31 October 2011}}</ref> The Braves starters lasted six or more innings only three times over the last 23 games.<ref name='AJC chronology' /> Over the last five games, all of which were losses for the Braves, the team managed to score only seven runs.<ref name='collapse complete'>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/recap?gid=310928115|title=Braves complete colossal collapse, lose to Phils|work=CBS Sports|date=29 September 2011}}</ref> Braves catcher [[Brian McCann (baseball)|Brian McCann]], often regarded as the best offensive catcher in the Majors, hit only .183 with two home runs in September.<ref name='AJC chronology' /> The offense as a whole hit for only a .235 [[batting average]] and a .300 [[on-base percentage]] in September, both second-worst in the [[National League]].

====2012: Chipper's last season====
[[File:Chipper Jones last reg season game.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chipper Jones salutes the crowd at [[Turner Field]] prior to his final regular season game on September 30, 2012. Jones announced he would retire after 19 seasons with the Braves]]

In 2012, the Braves began their 138th season after an upsetting end to the 2011 season. On March 22, the Braves announced that third baseman [[Chipper Jones]] would retire following the 2012 season after 19 Major League seasons with the team. The Braves also lost many key players through trades or free agency, including pitcher [[Derek Lowe]], shortstop [[Álex González (shortstop, born 1977)|Alex González]], and outfielder [[Nate McLouth]]. To compensate for this, the team went on to receive many key players such as outfielder [[Michael Bourn]], along with shortstops [[Tyler Pastornicky]] and [[Andrelton Simmons]]. To fill the void of a quality starting pitcher left by Lowe (as well as a mid-season injury to [[Brandon Beachy]]), manager Fredi González elected relief pitcher [[Kris Medlen]] to the starting pitching rotation. The Braves went on to win every game Medlen started, setting the MLB record for most consecutive wins when a single pitcher starts (total of 23). Atlanta stayed close to the [[Washington Nationals]] in the race to win the National League East title. They also stayed on top of the National League Wild Card race. Washington ended up winning their first division title in franchise history, but the Braves remained in first place of the NL wild card race. Keeping with a new MLB rule for the 2012 season, the top two wild card teams in each league must play each other in a [[2012 National League Wild Card Game|playoff game]] before entering into the [[Division Series]].

The Braves played the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the first ever [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]].  The Braves were behind 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when Andrelton Simmons hit a fly ball to left field that dropped in between the Cardinals shortstop and left fielder. Umpire [[Sam Holbrook]] called Simmons out, citing the [[infield fly rule]]. Had an infield fly not been called, Simmons would have been credited with a single and Atlanta would have had the bases loaded with one out. Fans at Turner Field began to litter the field with debris, prompting the game to be delayed for 19 minutes. The Braves lost the game 6–3, ending their season.

====2013: Braves win the East====

During the offseason following a gut wrenching exit against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|Wild Card Game]], the Braves spent the 2012–2013 offseason revamping and retooling their offense. The Braves turned heads across baseball by acquiring [[B.J. Upton]] from the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], signing him to a 5-year $75.25 million contract and making him their starting center fielder,<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121128&content_id=40445762&c_id=atl B.J.

The Braves began the 2013 season with a hot start in April by going 17-9 for the month, which saw the emergence of rookie sensation [[Evan Gattis]], while taking hold of first place in the [[National League East]] division, a lead they would never relinquish for the rest of the season. The Braves suffered many injuries to key players throughout the season, including injuries to [[Jason Heyward]], [[Brian McCann (baseball)|Brian McCann]], [[Freddie Freeman]], [[Eric O'Flaherty]], [[Jonny Venters]], [[Ramiro Pena]] and others, but found a way to win despite these blows to the team. Leading up to the All Star break, First Baseman Freddie Freeman was voted in to play for the 2013 National League All-Star Team, in the 2013 All Star Game, which he did not play. The Braves also witnessed the emergence of rookie pitcher [[Julio Teherán]] after much hype during Spring training.  From July 26 to August 10, the Braves won 14 games in a row.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2013/08/09/braves-beat-marlins-for-14th-straight-win/2638017/ | work=USA Today | title=Atlanta Braves beat Miami Marlins for 14th straight win}}</ref>  The winning streak was the longest of its kind since April–May 2000.

On June 28, 2013 the Atlanta Braves retired former third baseman Chipper Jones' jersey, number 10, before the game against the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. He was honored before 51,300 fans at [[Turner Field]] in [[Atlanta]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9434696/atlanta-braves-retire-chipper-jones-no-10-jersey Atlanta Braves retire Chipper Jones' No. 10 jersey – ESPN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He served as a staple of the Braves franchise for 19 years before announcing his retirement at the beginning of the 2012 season. [[Chipper Jones]] played his last regular season game for the Braves on September 30, 2012.

The Braves opened up a 15-game lead on the [[Washington Nationals]] in the [[National League East]] on September 3, 2013, riding that lead en route to its first division title since 2005, the last of 14 straight division titles. This was also Braves manager [[Fredi González]]'s first division title since beginning his managerial career in 1990; including his first since becoming the manager of the Braves after the 2010 season. The Braves clinched the 18th division title in team history on September 22, 2013<ref>[http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article/mlb/braves-overcome-injuries-to-capture-national-league-east-title?ymd=20130922&content_id=61400758&vkey=news_mlb Braves overcome injuries to capture National League East title | MLB.com: News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> after a Nationals loss to the Marlins in the first game of a double header; the Braves also won their game that day, beating the [[Chicago Cubs]] 5-2 at [[Wrigley Field]].

====2014: Losing season====

On November 11, 2013, the Braves announced that they would vacate Turner Field for a [[SunTrust Park|new stadium]] in [[Cobb County]], in the northwest suburbs outside of Atlanta in 2017. The move is to follow the expiration of the Braves' 20-year lease on Turner Field in 2016.

The Braves finished the season in a distant second place with a 79-83 record, which was their first losing season since 2008 and only their third since 1990.

====2015–2016: Rebuilding====
Prior to the 2015 season, the Braves fired their General Manager [[Frank Wren]], and [[John Hart (baseball)|John Hart]] replaced him as interim GM, choosing to only take the title of President of Baseball Operations. The Braves promptly traded [[Gold Glove Award]] winner [[Jason Heyward]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] along with pitcher [[Jordan Walden]] for pitchers [[Shelby Miller]] and [[Tyrell Jenkins]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/11892064/atlanta-braves-trade-jason-heyward-jordan-walden-st-louis-cardinals-shelby-miller-tyrell-jenkins]</ref> Hart would then trade All Star left fielder [[Justin Upton]] to the [[San Diego Padres]] for [[Max Fried]], [[Jace Peterson]], [[Dustin Peterson]], and [[Mallex Smith]].<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2014/12/19/justin-upton-trade-braves-padres/20633823/]</ref> Catcher [[Evan Gattis]] and minor league [[Prospect (sports)|prospect]] [[James Hoyt]] were traded to the [[Houston Astros]] for minor leaguers [[Mike Foltynewicz]], [[Rio Ruiz]], and [[Andrew Thurman]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/12167911/evan-gattis-traded-houston-astros-atlanta-braves]</ref> A day before the season began, the Braves made a final trade involving former All- Star [[Craig Kimbrel]] and outfielder [[Melvin Upton Jr.]]. They were traded to the San Diego Padres for outfielders [[Cameron Maybin]] and [[Carlos Quentin]] along with two minor league players.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/12624348/atlanta-braves-trade-craig-kimbrel-melvin-upton-jr-san-diego-padres]</ref> By the beginning of the season, the Braves did 11 trades in all.

Prior to the start of the 2016 regular season, the Braves continued their offseason rebuilding by trading [[Andrelton Simmons]] to the Los Angeles Angels for [[Erick Aybar]], and pitching prospects [[Sean Newcomb]] and [[Chris Ellis (baseball)|Chris Ellis]] and $2.5 million. They agreed to 1 year contracts with [[Kelly Johnson (baseball)|Kelly Johnson]], [[Chris Withrow]], and [[Arodys Vizcaino]], and agreed to terms on a minor league contract for [[Carlos Torres (pitcher)|Carlos Torres]] and [[Jeff Francoeur]]. The Braves would end up purchasing the Major League contract of Francoeur. 

On April 13, 2016, Hector Olivera was arrested and charged with the assault of a woman at the team hotel when the Braves were in Washington D.C. facing the Nationals. He was placed on Administrative Leave by Major League Baseball and was placed on the Braves Restricted List until further disciplinary action is given.<ref>http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/braves-hector-olivera-arrested-for-assault/ar-BBrIiW1?ocid=ansmsnsports11</ref>

The Braves began the season on a nine-game losing streak, which is the worst opening by the franchise since 1988, when they dropped the first 10 games of that season.

==Major rivalries==

===New York Mets===
{{main|Braves–Mets rivalry}}

The Braves–Mets rivalry is a rivalry between the two teams, featuring the Braves and the [[New York Mets]] as they both play in the [[National League East]].<ref name=RivalryWithMets>{{cite news|first=Lisa |last=Olson |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2003/07/08/2003-07-08_crazy_scene_at_shea_takes_lu.html?print=1&viewall=1 |title=Crazy scene at Shea takes luster off Mets-Braves rivalry |newspaper=[[New York Daily News]] |date=July 8, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205055839/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2003/07/08/2003-07-08_crazy_scene_at_shea_takes_lu.html?print=1&viewall=1 |archivedate=December 5, 2011 }}</ref>

Although their first major confrontation occurred when the Mets swept the Braves in the [[1969 National League Championship Series|1969 NLCS]], en route to their first World Series championship, the first playoff series won by an expansion team (also the first playoff appearance by an expansion team), the rivalry did not become especially heated until the 1994 season when division realignment put both the Mets and the Braves in the NL East division.<ref name=Realignment>{{cite news|quote=The Pirates will switch from the East next season. They opposed the move last week when realignment was approved, but agreed to allow Atlanta to move to the East.|title=Pirates OK new realignment|date=September 16, 1993|first=Hal|last=Bodley|newspaper=USA Today|page=1C}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pirates Relent on New Alignment|date=September 16, 1993|first=Murray|last=Chass|newspaper=New York Times|page=B14|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/16/sports/baseball-pirates-relent-on-new-alignment.html?pagewanted=print|authorlink=Murray Chass}}</ref> During this time the Braves became one of the most dominant teams in professional baseball, earning 14 straight division titles through 2005, including five world series berths, and one world series championship during the 1995 season. The rivalry remained heated through the early 2000s.

===Philadelphia Phillies===
While their rivalry with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] lacks the history and hatred of the Mets, it has been the more important one in the last decade. Since the 1993 season, the two teams have reigned almost exclusively as NL East champions, the exceptions being in 2006, when the Mets won their first division title since [[1988 New York Mets season|1988]] (no division titles were awarded in 1994 due to the [[1994–95 Major League Baseball strike|player's strike]]), and in 2012, when the [[Washington Nationals]] claimed their [[National League East#NL East champions by year|first division title since 1981]] when playing as the [[Montreal Expos]]. The Phillies 1993 championship was also part of a four-year reign of exclusive division championships by the Phillies and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], their [[Phillies–Pirates rivalry|in-state rivals]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pirates, Phillies Have Owned the Outgoing NL East Division |date=September 27, 1993 |first=Gene |last=Collier |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |page=D1}}</ref> While rivalries are generally characterized by mutual hatred, the Braves and Phillies deeply respect each other. Each game played (18 games in 2011) is vastly important between these two NL East giants, but at the end of the day, they are very similar organizations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schultz|first=Jeff|title=If Braves send message to Phillies, it will be done nicely|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/jeff-schultz-blog/2011/04/07/if-braves-send-message-to-phillies-it-will-be-done-nicely/?cxntfid=blogs_jeff_schultz_blog|work=Atlanta Journal Constitution|accessdate=May 26, 2011}}</ref>  Overall, the Braves and the Phillies are tied for [[National League East#Most Division Titles|the most National League East division titles]], having won 11 times each since 1969, with the Braves holding it for eleven consecutive years from 1995 through 2005.

The Braves currently have five different game [[baseball uniform]] combinations. The home uniforms consist of a standard white uniform, a red, military appreciation jersey worn with the standard white pants, and a cream alternate uniform. The road uniforms consist of a standard gray uniform, and an alternate navy blue jersey worn with the standard gray pants.

The white home uniform, introduced in 1987, is the primary home uniform.  The jersey has "Braves" written in script across the breastplate with the tomahawk logo underneath.  The jersey also includes piping around the collar and down the front of the jersey and around the bottom of the sleeves.  Player numbers appear on the back of the jersey with a nameplate above.  The Braves script, player numbers, and piping are red with a navy blue border.  The tomahawk is primarily red with blue and yellow detail and a navy blue border.  The white pants have identical piping to the jersey about the belt loops and down the outside seam of the pants.  The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a white nameplate.  The player names originally used vertically arched lettering but, since 2006, the team has used radially arched lettering.  The white uniform is paired with the standard home cap.  It is a red brimmed, navy blue cap with a white embroidered "script A" logo.  The home batting helmet is identical to the primary home cap.

The gray road uniforms are the primary road uniform.  The uniforms are identical to the white home uniforms with the exception of the "Braves" script, which is replaced by the "Atlanta" script.  Player names are sewn to a gray nameplate.  The primary uniforms are very similar to the uniforms that the Braves wore from 1946 to 1965—during their latter years in Boston and throughout their tenure in Milwaukee.

The red, military appreciation jersey was introduced on February 5, 2014.  The jerseys feature navy blue piping with a white border, the Braves script in blue with white stars, and the American Flag on the left sleeve.  The updated red jerseys will not include the tomahawk logo.  The jerseys will be worn for five home games in 2014: April 26 vs. the Cincinnati Reds (military family night), June 13 vs. the LA Angels of Anaheim (celebrating the Army), July 26 vs. the San Diego Padres (celebrating the Marines), Aug. 30 vs. the Miami Marlins (celebrating the Navy), and September 19 vs. NY Mets (celebrating the Air Force).<ref>http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-to-honor-military-with-alternative-jerseys/ndDzJ/</ref>  The jerseys will be paired with camouflage caps.<ref>http://www.ajc.com/gallery/sports/baseball/braves-introduce-alternate-jersey/gCHSL/#4510217</ref>  The military appreciation jerseys replace the red jerseys introduced in 2005.<ref>http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-home-red-jerseys-dropped-from-lineup/ndFBp/</ref>  Worn with the white pants, these jerseys included the same elements as the white jerseys, with the Braves script, player numbers, and piping in navy blue with a white border.  The tomahawk was primarily blue, with red and yellow detail and a white border.  The player names consisted of white lettering sewn to a red nameplate.  These jerseys were paired with an alternate home cap, which was a red brimmed, navy blue cap with a red, embroidered "script A" logo with a tomahawk, outlined in white.  The alternate cap did not have a matching batting helmet.  The red alternate jerseys were worn for Sunday home games from 2005–2011.  The only exceptions to this were the opening game of the 2005 [[National League Division Series|NLDS]], which was played on a Wednesday, and on Memorial Day in 2006.  The 2006 Memorial Day game is also the only time the red jerseys were paired with the primary home cap.  With the introduction of the cream uniform in 2012, the red jerseys were worn for Friday night home games from 2012–2013.  However, the Braves chose to wear the traditional white jerseys for their 2012 home opener, which took place on Friday, April 13.

The cream alternate uniforms were introduced in February 2012 as a tribute to the Braves' first season in Atlanta in 1966.  The jersey includes the "Braves" script across the breastplate, but the player number replaces the tomahawk underneath the "Braves" script on the left placket.  Player numbers and the "Braves" script are in red with a navy blue border.  The player names consist of navy blue lettering sewn to a cream nameplate.  The jersey has a thin, navy piping about the collar and down the front of the jersey.  There is no piping around the sleeves.  The cream pants include piping identical to the jersey down the outside seam.  The left sleeve of the jersey has a "crossed tomahawk" logo that replaces the "screaming Indian" logo that appeared on the 1966 jerseys.  The new logo has two, primarily red, crossed tomahawks.  Underneath the tomahawks is a blue circle outlined in red, with "1876" in red above (commemorating the year the franchise was founded), and "Atlanta Braves" in white below.  The cream uniforms are paired with the standard home cap and are worn for Saturday and Sunday home games.

The alternate navy blue road jerseys were introduced on opening night of the 2008 season against the Washington Nationals.  Worn with the gray road pants, the jerseys feature the "Atlanta" script on the breastplate in navy blue with a white outline.  The tomahawk is primarily navy blue with red and yellow detail and a white border.  The player numbers are blue with white borders and the player names are white letters sewn to a navy blue nameplate.  The navy blue jerseys have no piping either on the sleeves or around the collar.

From 1987 to 2008, the red brimmed, primary home cap was also worn on the road.  However, when the navy blue jerseys were introduced in 2008, they were paired with a navy blue cap, similar to the team's road cap worn from 1966 to 1971.  While the red brimmed cap was still primarily worn with the gray road uniforms, the team sometimes wore the navy blue cap with the gray jerseys, and the red brimmed cap was occasionally worn with the navy blue jerseys.  The red brimmed home batting helmets were also worn on the road from 1987 through 2008.  Beginning in 2009, the navy blue cap became the official road cap and was paired with a navy blue road batting helmet.

Unlike the home uniforms, which are worn based on a schedule, the road uniforms are chosen on game day by the starting pitcher.  However, they are also subject to [[Major League Baseball]] rules requiring the road team to wear uniforms that contrast with the uniforms worn by the home team.  Due to this rule, the gray uniforms are worn when the home team chooses to wear navy blue, and sometimes when the home team chooses to wear black.

==Logos==
From 1912 to 1989 the Braves logo consisted of the head of an Indian warrior. From 1912 to 1956 it was an Indian with a headdress, and thereafter a laughing Indian with a mohawk and one feather in his hair. In 1990 the logo was changed to just the word "Braves" in cursive with a tomahawk below it.

{{Main|List of Atlanta Braves broadcasters|Braves TBS Baseball|Atlanta Braves Radio Network}}

After years of stability, the Braves have faced a period of transition in their radio and television coverage.

The 2007 season was the last for Braves baseball on the [[TBS (TV network)|TBS Superstation]]. TBS showed 70 games throughout the country, then cleared the decks to make way for a [[Major League Baseball on TBS|new national broadcast package]] that began in earnest with the 2007 postseason, and expanded to Sunday afternoon games in 2008. Until his dismissal in 2009, [[Chip Caray]], one of the Braves' current broadcasters, called [[play-by-play]] for the national package, which includes the [[Division Series]] every season and alternating coverage of the [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]] and [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. Caray is joined by [[Joe Simpson (baseball)|Joe Simpson]], who has provided color commentary for the Braves since 1992.

Braves baseball had been on TBS since it was WTCG in 1972 and had been a cornerstone of the national superstation since it began in 1976. [[WPCH-TV|WPCH-TV/Peachtree TV]], formerly WTBS Atlanta, still carried Braves games after 2007, but only in parts of the Southern United States. After the transfer of the channel's operations from Time Warner to [[Meredith Corporation]], all Peachtree TV games were simulcast on [[Fox Sports South]] outside of the Peachtree TV coverage area in 2011 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albanyherald.com/mlb/headlines/MLB_NOTEBOOK_FSN_reaches_agreement_with_Peachtree_TV_to_broadcast_45_Braves_games_in_2011_Ex-Braves_Jones_signs_with_Yanks_114343144.html |title=MLB NOTEBOOK: FSN reaches agreement with Peachtree TV to broadcast 45 Braves games in 2011; Ex-Braves Jones signs with Yanks |publisher=Albanyherald.com |accessdate=July 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20111001130306/http://www.albanyherald.com/mlb/headlines/MLB_NOTEBOOK_FSN_reaches_agreement_with_Peachtree_TV_to_broadcast_45_Braves_games_in_2011_Ex-Braves_Jones_signs_with_Yanks_114343144.html |archivedate=1 October 2011 }}</ref>  On February 27, 2013, it was announced that Fox Sports South and SportSouth (now called [[Fox Sports Southeast]]) would carry every regionally televised Braves game exclusively, ending the team's partnership with WPCH-TV after 40 years.<ref>[http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/baseball/braves-tv-deal-changes-games-move-peachtree-tv/nWcNF/ Braves' TV deal changes; games move off Peachtree TV ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', February 27, 2013]</ref>

After the 2004 season, longtime radio flagship station [[WSB (AM)|750 WSB]] was replaced by [[WGST]] 640AM. Due to WGST's weak signal at night, which fails to cover the entire [[Atlanta metropolitan area]], all games began to be simulcast on [[FM radio]] when the rights were transferred. The games first appeared on 96.1 [[WWPW|WKLS]] (formerly "96 Rock") in 2005, but moved to [[country music]] station 94.9 [[WUBL]] ("94.9 The Bull") in 2007 after WKLS underwent a change in format from [[classic rock]] to [[active rock]] and became [[WWPW|Project 9–6–1]]. As of the 2009 season, the Braves returned to WKLS on the FM frequency but remained on WGST on AM. It was announced that for the 2010 season, the Braves will be flagshipped on [[WCNN]] 680 The Fan and in Atlanta on the AM dial and [[WNNX]] 100.5 FM.<ref>Press Release- [http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20090302&content_id=3904480&vkey=pr_atl&fext=.jsp&c_id=atl "Atlanta Braves and Clear Channel Announce Move to Project 9–6–1 for 2009 Games."] March 2, 2009.

The Atlanta Braves radio network currently serves 134 radio stations across the Southern United States, including 20 in [[Alabama]], 4 in Florida, 68 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 1 in [[Mississippi]], 13 in [[North Carolina]], 14 in [[South Carolina]], and 14 in [[Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/schedule/affiliates.jsp |title=Affiliate Radio Stations &#124; braves.com: Schedule |publisher=Atlanta.braves.mlb.com |accessdate=July 25, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110714010651/http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/atl/schedule/affiliates.jsp| archivedate= July 14, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Since 2009, the radio announcers have been former Brewers announcer [[Jim Powell (sportscaster)|Jim Powell]] and [[Don Sutton]]. Sutton was released after the [[2006 in baseball|2006 season]] and called [[Washington Nationals]] games on television from 2007 to 2008, but he has since returned for the 2009 season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Carroll |url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/braves/stories/2009/01/27/braves_sutton.html?cxntlid=thbz_hm |title=Sutton rejoins Braves’ broadcast team |publisher=Ajc.com |date=January 27, 2009 |accessdate=July 25, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110629062651/http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/braves/stories/2009/01/27/braves_sutton.html?cxntlid=thbz_hm| archivedate= June 29, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Longtime Braves voices [[Skip Caray]] and [[Pete Van Wieren]] were the primary play-by-play voices of Braves baseball until Skip's sudden death on August 3, 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=441791 |title=Sportingnews.com |publisher=Sportingnews.com |accessdate=July 25, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110629131957/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=441791| archivedate= June 29, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> and Van Wieren's retirement after the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mark Bowman&nbsp;/&nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081021&content_id=3634597&vkey=news_atl&fext=.jsp&c_id=atl |title=Atlanta.braves.mlb.com |publisher=Atlanta.braves.mlb.com |date=October 21, 2008 |accessdate=July 25, 2011| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20110616143023/http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081021&content_id=3634597&vkey=news_atl&fext=.jsp&c_id=atl| archivedate= June 16, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
