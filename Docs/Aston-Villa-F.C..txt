Founded in 1874, they have played at their current home ground, [[Villa Park]], since 1897. Aston Villa were the originators and founding members of [[the Football League]] in 1888.

[[File:FACupFinal1905NewcastleVilla.jpg|thumb|left|[[Harry Hampton (footballer born 1885)|Harry Hampton]] scores one of his two goals in the [[1905 FA Cup Final]]]]
Aston Villa Football Club were formed in March 1874, by members of the Villa Cross [[John Wesley|Wesleyan]] Chapel in [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] which is now part of [[Birmingham]]. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/news/top-stories/2007/11/26/cup-presented-to-aston-villa-founder-member-jack-hughes-is-back-with-his-family-97319-20162107/ |title=Cup presented to Aston Villa founder member Jack Hughes is back with his family |first=Nick |last=McCarthy |date=26 November 2007 |newspaper=Birmingham Mail |accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> Aston Villa's first match was against the local [[St Mary's Church, Aston Brook|Aston Brook St Mary's]] [[Rugby football|Rugby]] team. As a condition of the match, the Villa side had to agree to play the first half under rugby rules and the second half under football rules.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 6.</ref> After moving to the [[Wellington Road (Perry Barr)|Wellington Road]] ground in 1876, Villa soon established themselves as one of the best teams in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the [[Birmingham Senior Cup]] in 1880, under the captaincy of Scotsman [[George Ramsay]].<ref name="Hall of Fame">{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015041500/http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HallOfFame/0,,10265,00.html |archivedate=15 October 2007|title=Aston Villa Hall of Fame |publisher=Aston Villa F.C|url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HallOfFame/0,,10265,00.html}}</ref>

The club won their first FA Cup in 1887 with captain [[Archie Hunter]] becoming one of the game's first household names. Aston Villa were one of the dozen teams that competed in the inaugural Football League in 1888 with one of the club's directors, [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]] being the league's founder. Aston Villa emerged as the most successful English club of the Victorian era, winning no fewer than five League titles and three FA Cups by the end of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign.<ref name="Ward192">Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 192.</ref> In 1897, the year Villa won [[Double (association football)|The Double]], they moved into their present home, the Aston Lower Grounds.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; pp. 33–36.</ref> Supporters coined the name "Villa Park"; no official declaration listed the ground as [[Villa Park]].<ref>Hayes, Dean; p. 170.</ref>

Aston Villa won their sixth FA Cup in 1920, soon after though the club began a slow decline that led to Villa, at the time one of the most famous and successful clubs in world football, being relegated in 1936 for the first time to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. This was largely the result of a dismal defensive record: they conceded 110 goals in 42 games, 7 of them coming from [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] [[Ted Drake]] in an [[Aston Villa 1–7 Arsenal (14 December 1935)|infamous 1–7 defeat]] at Villa Park.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 71.</ref> Like all English clubs, Villa lost seven seasons to the Second World War, and that conflict brought several careers to a premature end.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 75.</ref> The team was rebuilt under the guidance of former player [[Alex Massie]] for the remainder of the 1940s. Aston Villa's first trophy for 37 years came in the 1956–57 season when another former Villa player, [[Eric Houghton]] led the club to a then record seventh FA Cup Final win, defeating the 'Busby Babes' of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the final.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; pp. 86–87.</ref> The team struggled in the league though and were relegated two seasons later, due in large part to complacency. However, under the stewardship of manager [[Joe Mercer]] Villa returned to the top-flight in 1960 as Second Division Champions. The following season Aston Villa became the first team to win the [[Football League Cup]].<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 93.</ref>

Mercer's forced retirement from the club in 1964 signalled a period of deep turmoil. The most successful club in England was struggling to keep pace with changes in the modern game, with Villa being relegated for the third time, under manager [[Dick Taylor (football manager)|Dick Taylor]] in 1967. The following season the fans called for the board to resign as Villa finished 16th in the Second Division. With mounting debts and Villa lying at the bottom of Division Two, the board sacked [[Tommy Cummings]] (the manager brought in to replace Taylor), and within weeks the entire board resigned under overwhelming pressure from fans.<ref name="Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p.100">Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 100.</ref> After much speculation, control of the club was bought by London financier Pat Matthews, who also brought in [[Doug Ellis]] as chairman.<ref name="Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p.100" /> However, new ownership could not prevent Villa being relegated to the Third Division for the first time at the end of the [[1969–70 in English football|1969–70]] season. However, Villa gradually began to recover under the management of former club captain [[Vic Crowe]]. In the [[1971–72 in English football|1971–72 season]] they returned to the Second Division as Champions with a record 70 points.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 106.</ref> In 1974, [[Ron Saunders]] was appointed manager. His brand of no-nonsense man-management proved effective, with the club winning the League Cup the following season and, at the end of season 1974–75, he had taken them back into the First Division and into Europe.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 111.</ref>

[[File:82team.jpg|thumb|left|The 1982 European Cup winning squad celebrate the 25th anniversary of their win.|alt=In the foreground is two men holding a large cup, they have claret scarves and a medal around their necks. Around them are ten old players in suits with medals and scarves around their necks]]
Villa were back among the elite as Saunders continued to mould a winning team. This culminated in a seventh top-flight league title in [[1980–81 in English football|1980–81]]. To the surprise of commentators and fans, Saunders quit halfway through the [[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]] season, after falling out with the chairman, with Villa in the quarter final of the European Cup. He was replaced by his softly-spoken assistant manager [[Tony Barton (footballer)|Tony Barton]] who guided the club to a 1–0 victory over [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] in the [[1982 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] in [[Rotterdam]] courtesy of a [[Peter Withe]] goal. The following season Villa were crowned [[European Super Cup]] winners, beating [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the final. This marked a pinnacle though and Villa's fortunes declined sharply for most of the 1980s, culminating in relegation in 1987.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 148.</ref> This was followed by promotion the following year under [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] and a runners-up position in the First Division in the 1989–90 season.<ref>Ward, Adam; Griffin, Jeremy; p. 155.</ref>

Villa were one of the founding members of the Premier League in 1992, and finished runners-up to Manchester United in the inaugural season. For the rest of the Nineties however Villa went through three different managers and their league positions were inconsistent, although they did win two League Cups and regularly achieved [[UEFA Cup]] qualification. Villa reached the FA Cup final in 2000 but lost 1–0 to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the last game to be played at the old [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fchd.info/ASTONVIL.HTM |title=Aston Villa |work=Football Club History Database |publisher=Richard Rundle |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Chelsea claim FA Cup glory |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sport/football/fa_cup/756784.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 May 2000 |accessdate=21 September 2010}}</ref> Again Villa's league position continued to fluctuate under several different managers and things came to a head in the summer of 2006 when [[David O'Leary]] left in acrimony.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/5196872.stm |title=O'Leary parts company with Villa |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=15 September 2008 | date=19 July 2006}}</ref> After 23 years as chairman and single biggest shareholder (approximately 38%), Doug Ellis finally decided to sell his stake in Aston Villa due to ill-health.

The club colours are a claret shirt with sky blue sleeves, white shorts with claret and blue trim, and sky blue socks with claret and white trim. They were the original wearers of the claret and blue. Villa's colours at the outset generally comprised plain shirts (white, grey or a shade of blue), with either white or black shorts. For a few years after that (1877–79) the team wore several different kits from all white, blue and black, red and blue to plain green. By 1880, black jerseys with a red lion embroidered on the chest were introduced by William McGregor. This remained the first choice strip for six years. On Monday, 8 November 1886, an entry in the club's official minute book states:

{{quote|(i) Proposed and seconded that the colours be chocolate and sky blue shirts and that we order two dozen.
(ii) Proposed and seconded that Mr McGregor be requested to supply them at the lowest quotation.}}

A new badge was revealed in May 2007, for the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08]] season and beyond. The new badge includes a [[Star (football badge)|star]] to represent the European Cup win in 1982, and has a light blue background behind Villa's 'lion rampant'. The traditional motto ''"Prepared"'' remains in the badge, and the name Aston Villa has been shortened to AVFC, FC having been omitted from the previous badge. The lion is now unified as opposed to fragmented lions of the past. [[Randy Lerner]] petitioned fans to help with the design of the new badge.<ref name="new badge">{{cite web |url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/HistoryKits |title=The Aston Villa Hit: The Current Crest |publisher=Aston Villa F.C |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>

The lion in the new badge will have claws added to it and the word "Prepared" will be removed to increase the size of the lion and club initials in the badge.<ref name=introducing>{{cite web | url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~5475744,00.html | title=Introducing our badge for 2016/17 | publisher=Aston Villa Football Club | date=6 April 2016 | accessdate=6 April 2016}}</ref>

=== Kit sponsorship ===

== Stadium ==
{{Main|Villa Park}}
Aston Villa's current home venue is Villa Park, which is a [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA 5-star rated stadium]], having previously played at Aston Park (1874–1876) and [[Wellington Road (Perry Barr)|Wellington Road]] (1876–1897). Villa Park is the largest football stadium in the English Midlands, and the eighth largest stadium in England. It has hosted 16 England internationals at senior level, the first in 1899, and the most recent in 2005. Thus, it was the first English ground to stage international football in three different centuries.<ref name=favillaprk>{{cite web| url=http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/11/England_vHolland_VillaPark.htm| title=England international matches at Villa Park |publisher=FA|accessdate=15 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041211203124/http://www.thefa.com/England/SeniorTeam/NewsAndFeatures/Postings/2004/11/England_vHolland_VillaPark.htm|archivedate=11 December 2004}}</ref> Villa Park is the most used stadium in FA Cup semi-final history, having hosted 55 semi-finals. The club have planning permission to extend the North Stand; this will involve the 'filling in' of the corners to either side of the North Stand. If completed, the capacity of Villa Park will be increased to approximately 51,000.

The current training ground is located at [[Bodymoor Heath Training Ground|Bodymoor Heath]] near [[Kingsbury, Warwickshire|Kingsbury]] in north [[Warwickshire]], the site for which was purchased by former chairman Doug Ellis in the early 1970s from a local farmer. Although Bodymoor Heath was state-of-the-art in the 1970s, by the late 1990s the facilities had started to look dated. In November 2005, Ellis and Aston Villa plc announced a state of the art [[Pound sterling|GB£]]13&nbsp;million redevelopment of Bodymoor in two phases. However, work on Bodymoor was suspended by Ellis due to financial problems, and was left in an unfinished state until new owner Randy Lerner made it one of his priorities to make the site one of the best in world football. The new training ground was officially unveiled on 6 May 2007, by then manager [[Martin O'Neill]], then team captain [[Gareth Barry]] and 1982 European Cup winning team captain [[Dennis Mortimer]], with the Aston Villa squad moving in for the 2007–08 season.<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825003721/http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/HeadlinesDetail/0,,10265~1021732,00.html|archivedate=25 August 2007|title=Gaffer on BMH |publisher=Aston Villa F.C|url=http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/HeadlinesDetail/0,,10265~1021732,00.html}}</ref>

== Ownership ==
[[File:Lerner, Randy.jpg|thumb|right|Randy Lerner, the club owner of Aston Villa (2006-2016).]]
The first shares in the club were issued towards the end of the 19th century as a result of legislation that was intended to codify the growing numbers of professional teams and players in the Association Football leagues. FA teams were required to distribute shares to investors as a way of facilitating trading among the teams without implicating the FA itself. This trading continued for much of the 20th century until Ellis started buying up many of the shares in the 1960s. He was chairman and substantial shareholder of "Aston Villa F.C." from 1968 to 1975 and the majority shareholder from 1982 to 2006. The club were [[Initial public offering|floated]] on the [[London Stock Exchange]] (LSE) in 1996, and the share price fluctuated in the ten years after the flotation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Aston-Villa-plc-Company-History.html |title=Company Histories & Profiles: Aston Villa plc |publisher=FundingUniverse.com |accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> In 2006 it was announced that several consortia and individuals were considering bids for Aston Villa.<ref name=EndEllisEra/>

On 14 August 2006, it was confirmed that [[Randy Lerner]], then owner of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Cleveland Browns]], had reached an agreement of £62.6&nbsp;million with Aston Villa for a takeover of the club. A statement released on 25 August to the LSE announced that Lerner had secured 59.69% of Villa shares, making him the majority shareholder. He also appointed himself Chairman of the club.<ref name=Ellisearner>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2006/aug/23/ellisrollsawayfromhisnice |title=Ellis rolls away from his nice Villa earner |first=David |last=Conn |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=19 March 2012 | location=London}}</ref> In Ellis's last year in charge Villa lost £8.2m before tax, compared with a £3m profit the previous year, and income had fallen from £51.6m to £49m.<ref name=EndEllisEra>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/4792189.stm | title=End of Ellis era |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 September 2006 |accessdate=15 September 2008 |first=Simon |last=Austin}}</ref> Lerner took full control on 18 September, as he had 89.69% of the shares. On 19 September 2006, Ellis and his board resigned to be replaced with a new board headed by Lerner.<ref name=EndEllisEra/> Lerner installed [[Charles Krulak]] as a non-executive director and Ellis was awarded the honorary position of Chairman Emeritus.

Lerner put the club up for sale in May 2014, valuing it at an estimated £200&nbsp;million.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/aston-villa/10777086/Randy-Lerner-ready-to-sell-as-Aston-Villa-limp-to-Premier-League-safety.html|title=Randy Lerner ready to sell as Aston Villa limp to Premier League safety|date=20 April 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

On 18 May 2016, Randy Lerner agreed the sale of Aston Villa to Recon Group, owned by Chinese businessman Dr Tony Jiantong Xia, for a reported £60 million. The sale will be completed if approved by the Football League and the club is set to become part of Recon Group's Sport, Leisure and Tourism division.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introducing Tony Xia {{!}} Latest News {{!}} Aston Villa|url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~5580405,00.html|website=www.avfc.co.uk|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref> During an interview, Xia said Aston Villa should be a top six Premier League side and hoped to achieve promotion back to the Premiership during the 2016/17 season: "If we can get the right team to work with we can get on the right track and I hope we can achieve it one year."

Aston Villa have a large fanbase and draw support from all over the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and beyond, with supporters' clubs all across the world. Former Villa chief executive Richard Fitzgerald has stated that the ethnicity of the supporters is currently 98% white.

Like many English football clubs Aston Villa have had several [[Football hooliganism|hooligan firms]] associated with them: ''Villa Youth'', ''Steamers'', ''[[Aston Villa Hardcore|Villa Hardcore]]'' and the ''C-Crew'', the last mentioned being very active during the 1970s and 1980s.

There have been many players who can be called notable throughout Aston Villa's history. These can be classified and recorded in several forms. The Halls of Fame and PFA Players of the Year are noted below. {{As of|2014}}, Aston Villa, jointly with Tottenham Hotspur, hold the record for providing the most [[England national football team|England]] internationals with 73.<ref name="England">{{cite web|title=How many players has your club provided for England?|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/england/11508860/How-many-players-has-your-club-provided-for-England.html|website=Telegraph|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> Aston Villa have had several players who were [[One-club man|one-club men]]. In 1998, to celebrate the 100th season of League football, [[The Football League]] released a list entitled the [[Football League 100 Legends]] that consisted of "100 legendary [[Association football|football]] players." There were seven players included on the list who had formerly played for Villa: [[Danny Blanchflower]], [[Trevor Ford]], [[Archie Hunter]], [[Sam Hardy]], [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]], [[Peter Schmeichel]] and [[Clem Stephenson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/144986.stm |title=Sport: Football Legends list in full |date=5 August 1998 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=19 March 2012}}</ref>

Three Aston Villa players have won the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] award.
