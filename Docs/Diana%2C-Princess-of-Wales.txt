'''Diana, Princess of Wales''' (Diana Frances;{{efn|name=surname}} ''née'' '''[[Spencer family|Spencer]]'''; 1 July 1961&nbsp;– 31 August 1997), was the first wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], who is the eldest child and [[heir apparent]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].

Diana was born into a family of [[British nobility]] with royal ancestry as ''The Honourable'' Diana Spencer. She was the fourth child and third daughter of [[John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer|John Spencer, Viscount Althorp]] and [[the Honourable]] [[Frances Shand Kydd|Frances Roche]]. She grew up in Park House, situated on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham estate]], and was educated in [[England]] and [[Switzerland]]. In 1975, after her father inherited the title of [[Earl Spencer (peerage)|Earl Spencer]], she became ''Lady'' Diana Spencer.

Her [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer|wedding to the Prince of Wales]] on 29 July 1981, held at [[St Paul's Cathedral]], reached a global television audience of over 750 million people. While married, Diana bore the titles [[Princess of Wales]], [[Duchess of Cornwall]], [[Duchess of Rothesay]], [[Countess of Chester (title)|Countess of Chester]], and [[Baroness of Renfrew]]. The marriage produced two sons, the princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry|Harry]], who were then respectively second and third in the [[line of succession to the British throne]]. As Princess of Wales, Diana undertook royal duties on behalf of the Queen and represented her at functions overseas. She was celebrated for her charity work and for her support of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]]. She was involved with dozens of charities including London's [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] for children, of which she was president from 1989.

Diana remained the object of worldwide media scrutiny during and after her marriage, which ended in divorce on 28 August 1996. Media attention and public mourning were extensive after [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|her death in a car crash]] in Paris on 31 August 1997 and subsequent [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|televised funeral]].

==Early life==
Diana was born on 1 July 1961, in Park House, [[Sandringham, Norfolk]].{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=70}} She was the fourth of five children of [[John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer|John Spencer, Viscount Althorp]] (1924–1992) and his first wife, [[Frances Shand Kydd|Frances]] ([[Maiden and married names|née]] Roche; 1936–2004).{{sfn|Morton |1997|pp=70-71}} The [[Spencer family]] has been closely allied with the [[British Royal Family]] for several generations.{{sfn|Brown|2007|pp=32–33}} Both of Diana's grandmothers had served as [[ladies in waiting]] to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=2}} The Spencers were hoping for a boy to carry on the family line, and no name was chosen for a week, until they settled on Diana Frances, after her mother and [[Diana Russell, Duchess of Bedford]], her distant relative who was also known as "Lady Diana Spencer" before marriage and was a prospective Princess of Wales.{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} Diana was baptised at [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham]].{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} Diana had three siblings: [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale|Sarah]], [[Jane Fellowes, Baroness Fellowes|Jane]], and [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|Charles]].{{sfn|Brown|2007|pp=37–38}} An infant brother, John, died shortly after his birth in 1960.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=37}} The desire for an heir added strain to the Spencers' marriage, and Lady Althorp was reportedly sent to [[Harley Street]] clinics in London to determine the cause of the "problem".{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} The experience was described as "humiliating" by Diana's younger brother, Charles: "It was a dreadful time for my parents and probably the root of their divorce because I don't think they ever got over it."{{sfn|Morton |1997|p=71}} Diana grew up in Park House, situated on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham estate]].{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=41}} The Spencers leased the house from its owner, Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. The Royal Family frequently holidayed at the neighbouring Sandringham House, and Diana played with Princes [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Andrew]] and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]] as a child.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|pp=2, 20}}

Diana was seven years old when her parents divorced,{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=42}} after her mother had an affair with [[Peter Shand Kydd]]. The two were married in 1969.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|pp=40, 42}} Diana lived with her mother in London during her parents' separation in 1967. However, during Christmas holidays that year, Lord Althorp refused to let Diana and her brother Charles return to London with Lady Althorp. Shortly afterwards, Lord Althorp won custody of Diana and her brother with support from his former mother-in-law, [[Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy]].{{sfn|Brown|2007|pp=40–41}} In 1972, Lord Althorp began a relationship with [[Raine Spencer, Countess Spencer|Raine, Countess of Dartmouth]], the only daughter of Alexander McCorquodale and [[Dame Barbara Cartland]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=25}} They married at [[Caxton Hall]], London in 1976.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=34}} Diana became known as ''Lady'' Diana after her father inherited the title of [[Earl Spencer (peerage)|Earl Spencer]] in 1975, at which point her father moved the family from Park House to [[Althorp]], the Spencer seat in [[Northampton]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=29}}

==Education and career==
Diana began her education at Silfield Private School in [[Gayton, Norfolk]], and moved to [[Riddlesworth Hall School]], an all-girls boarding school near [[Diss]], when she was nine.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|pp=21–22}} She joined her sisters at [[The New School at West Heath|West Heath Girls' School]] in [[Sevenoaks]], [[Kent]], in 1973.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=23}} She did not shine academically, failing her [[General Certificate of Education|O-levels]] twice. Her outstanding community spirit was recognised with an award from West Heath.<ref name="TeenageRoyal">{{cite web|url=https://www.royal.uk/diana-princess-wales|title=Diana, Princess of Wales|work=The British Monarchy|publisher=The Royal Household}}</ref> She left West Heath when she was sixteen.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=35}} Her brother Charles recalls her as being quite shy up until that time.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|pp=40–41}} She showed a talent for music as an accomplished pianist.<ref name="TeenageRoyal"/> Diana also excelled in swimming and diving, and studied ballet and [[tap dance]].{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=55}}

After attending [[Institut Alpin Videmanette]], a [[finishing school]] in [[Rougemont, Switzerland]], for one term in 1978, Diana returned to London, where she shared her mother's flat with two school friends.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=41, 44}} In London, she took an advanced cooking course, but seldom cooked for her roommates. She took a series of low-paying jobs; she worked as a dance instructor for youth until a skiing accident caused her to miss three months of work.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=68}} She then found employment as a playgroup pre-school assistant, did some cleaning work for her sister Sarah and several of her friends, and acted as a hostess at parties. Diana spent time working as a nanny for the Robertsons, an American family living in London,{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=103}} and worked as a nursery teacher at the Young England School in [[Pimlico]].{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=45}} In July 1979, her mother bought her a flat at Coleherne Court in [[Earls Court]] as an 18th birthday present.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=46}} She lived there with three flatmates until February 25, 1981.{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=118}}

==Marriage to the Prince of Wales==
Diana first met Charles, Prince of Wales, in November 1977 when he and Diana's sister, Lady Sarah, were dating.{{sfn|Bradford|2006|p=40}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ythQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=i9AMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6693,1931194&dq=frances+ruth+roche&hl=en|title=Descendant of 4 Kings Charms Her Prince|newspaper=Daily Times|location=London|accessdate=24 April 2016|date=24 July 1981|last=Glass|first=Robert}}</ref> He took a serious interest in her as a potential bride during the summer of 1980, when they were guests at a country weekend, where she watched him play [[polo]]. The relationship developed as he invited her for a sailing weekend to [[Cowes]] aboard the royal yacht ''[[HMY Britannia|Britannia]]''. This was followed by an invitation to [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] (the Royal Family's Scottish residence) to meet his family a weekend in November 1980.<ref name=age17nov>{{cite news|title=Royal weekend fuels rumours|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DPRUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=a5IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4597,379407&dq=diana+spencer&hl=en|accessdate=22 July 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=17 November 1980|location=London}}</ref>{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=279|1994}} Lady Diana was well received by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]], [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke of Edinburgh]], and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]. The couple subsequently courted in London. The prince proposed on 6 February 1981, and Lady Diana accepted, but their engagement was kept secret for the next few weeks.{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=118}}

At the altar, Diana accidentally reversed the order of Charles's first two names, saying "Philip Charles" Arthur George instead.<ref name="BBC"/> She did not say that she would "obey" him; that traditional vow was left out at the couple's request, which caused some comment at the time.<ref name="'70s 98">{{Cite book|title= How We Got bare: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 98}}</ref> Diana [[Wedding dress of Lady Diana Spencer|wore a dress]] valued at £9,000 with a 25-foot (7.62-metre) train.<ref name="Denney2005">{{cite book|last=Denney|first=Colleen|title=Representing Diana, Princess of Wales: cultural memory and fairy tales revisited|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NU7rpq8HFxYC&pg=PA57|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=April 2005|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-4023-4|page=57}}</ref> Music and songs used during the wedding included the "[[Prince of Denmark's March]]", "[[I Vow to Thee, My Country]]", "[[Pomp and Circumstance Marches#March No. 4 in G|Pomp and Circumstance No.4]]", and "[[God Save the Queen]]".<ref>[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-07-29-15-001&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-07-29-15 Royal Wedding], ''The Times''  29 July 1981, p, 15</ref>

After becoming Princess of Wales, Diana automatically acquired rank as the third-highest female in the [[United Kingdom Order of Precedence]] (after the Queen and the Queen Mother), and was fifth or sixth in the [[order of precedence|orders of precedence]] of her other realms, following the Queen, the relevant [[viceroy]], the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales.

The couple made their homes at [[Kensington Palace]] and at [[Highgrove House]], near [[Tetbury]]. On 5 November 1981, the Princess' first pregnancy was officially announced.{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=195}} After Diana fell down a staircase at Sandringham in January 1982, 12 weeks into her first pregnancy, the royal [[gynaecologist]] [[George Pinker|Sir George Pinker]] was summoned from London. He found that although she had suffered severe bruising, the [[foetus]] was uninjured.<ref name=TelgPinker>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1550160/Sir-George-Pinker.html|title=Obituary: Sir George Pinker|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=1 May 2007|accessdate=22 December 2012|location=London}}</ref> In the private Lindo Wing of [[St Mary's Hospital, London|St Mary's Hospital]] in [[Paddington, London]], on 21 June 1982, under the care of Pinker,<ref name=TelgPinker/> the Princess gave birth to her and the Prince's first son and heir, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William Arthur Philip Louis]].{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=138}} Amidst some media criticism, she decided to take William, still a baby, on her first major tours of Australia and New Zealand, but the decision was popularly applauded. By her own admission, the Princess of Wales had not initially intended to take William until it was suggested by [[Malcolm Fraser]], the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian prime minister]].{{sfn|Morton|1997|pp=142–143}}

A second son, [[Prince Harry|Henry Charles Albert David]], was born on 15 September 1984.{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=147}} The Princess asserted she and the Prince were closest during her pregnancy with Harry (as the younger prince has always been known).

She chose their first given names, dismissed a royal family nanny and engaged one of her own choosing, selected their schools and clothing, planned their outings, and took them to school herself as often as her schedule permitted. She also organised her public duties around their timetables.{{sfn|Morton|1997|p=184}}

===Problems and separation===
Within five years of her marriage, the couple's incompatibility and age difference (almost 13 years),{{sfn|Brown|2007|p=174}} as well as Diana's concern about Charles's relationship with [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker Bowles]],{{sfn|Smith|p=561|2000}} became visible and damaging to their marriage. During the early 1990s, the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales fell apart, an event at first suppressed, then sensationalised, by the world media. Both the Princess and Prince spoke to the press through friends, each blaming the other for the marriage's demise.

The chronology of the break-up identifies reported difficulties between the Prince and Princess as early as 1985.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/02/10/charles.chronology/|title=Timeline: Long road to the altar|publisher=CNN|date=25 March 2005|accessdate=31 January 2016}}</ref> The Prince of Wales resumed his affair with his now-married former girlfriend, Camilla Parker Bowles; later, the Princess of Wales began a relationship with Major [[James Hewitt]]. These affairs were exposed in May 1992 with the publication of ''Diana: Her True Story'' by [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]]. It was serialised in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' before its publication.<ref>{{cite news|title=Princess Di breaks down after making appearance|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eUJWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jOoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6821,2308048&dq=princess+diana&hl=en|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=Eugene Register Guard|date=12 June 1992}}</ref> The book, which also laid bare the Princess' allegedly suicidal unhappiness, caused a media storm. During 1992 and 1993, leaked tapes of telephone conversations negatively reflected on both the royal antagonists. Tape recordings of the Princess and James Gilbey were made available by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper's hotline in August 1992.<ref>{{cite news|title=Princess Diana's 'admirer' named by Press|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A7FUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YJADAAAAIBAJ&pg=5278,2918655&dq=princess+diana&hl=en|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=27 August 1992|location=London}}</ref> Transcripts of taped intimate conversations were published by ''The Sun'' in August 1992. The article's title, "[[Squidgygate]]", referenced Gilbey's affectionate nickname for Diana. The next to surface, in November 1992, were the leaked "Camillagate" tapes, intimate exchanges between the Prince of Wales and Camilla, published in ''[[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]]'' and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]''.{{sfn|Brown|2007|pp=304, 309}}<!-- more sourcing needed, as Brown mentions the tapes but does not name the newspapers or the publication dates -->

In the meantime, rumours had begun to surface about the Princess of Wales's relationship with Hewitt, her and her children's former riding instructor. These would be brought into the open by the publication in 1994 of a 1994 book by Anna Pasternak titled ''Princess in Love'', which was filmed under the same title in a movie directed by [[David Greene (director)|David Greene]] in 1996.<ref name=pinlove/> The Princess of Wales was portrayed by [[Julie Cox]] and James Hewitt was portrayed by [[Christopher Villiers]].<ref name=pinlove>{{cite web|title=Princess in Love (1996)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0125988/|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=13 July 2013}}</ref>

In December 1992, Prime Minister [[John Major]] announced the couple's "amicable separation" to the House of Commons,{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=489|1994}} and the full Camillagate transcript was published a month later in the newspapers, in January 1993. On 3 December 1993, the Princess of Wales announced her withdrawal from public life.<ref name="timeline">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3868403.stm |title=Timeline: Diana, Princess of Wales|work=BBC News|date=5 July 2004|accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref>

The Prince of Wales sought public understanding via a televised interview with [[Jonathan Dimbleby]] on 29 June 1994. In this he confirmed his own extramarital affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, saying that he had rekindled their association in 1986, only after his marriage to the Princess had "irretrievably broken down".<ref>[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/royals/etc/cron.html "The Princess and the Press"] and at [http://www.gm.tv/articles/gmtv-today/march-2005/royal-couple-special/13914-royal-timeline.html "The timeline to Charles and Camilla's marriage"], Retrieved 8 January 2010.</ref>{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=395|1994}}

While she blamed Camilla Parker Bowles for her marital troubles because of her previous relationship with the Prince, the Princess at some point began to believe that he had other affairs. In October 1993, she wrote to a friend that she believed her husband was now in love with [[Tiggy Legge-Bourke]] and wanted to marry her.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/monarchy/story/0,,2236744,00.html |title=Diana affair over before crash, inquest told|work=The Guardian|location=London|author=Rosalind Ryan|date=7 January 2008|accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref> Legge-Bourke had been hired by the Prince as a young companion for his sons while they were in his care, and the Princess was resentful of Legge-Bourke and her relationship with the young princes.

Diana's aunt-in-law, [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]], burnt "highly personal" letters that Diana wrote to the Queen Mother in 1993 because she thought they were considered to be "so private".  Biographer William Shawcross wrote: "No doubt Princess Margaret felt that she was protecting her mother and other members of the family".

The burial occurred privately later the same day. Diana's former husband, sons, mother, siblings, a close friend, and a clergyman were present. Diana's body was clothed in a black long-sleeved dress designed by [[Catherine Walker (fashion designer)|Catherine Walker]], which she had chosen some weeks before. A set of [[rosary]] beads was placed in her hands, a gift she had received from [[Mother Teresa]], who died the same week as Diana. Her grave is on an island ({{Coord|52.283082|-1.000278|region:GB_type:landmark}}) within the grounds of [[Althorp]] Park, the Spencer family home for centuries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/politics97/diana/althorp.html|title=Diana Returns Home|work=BBC|accessdate=29 June 2015}}</ref>

The burial party was provided by the 2nd Battalion [[The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment]], who were given the honour of carrying the Princess across to the island and laying her to rest. Diana was the Regiment's [[Colonel-in-Chief]] from 1992 to 1996.<ref name=army/> The original plan was for Diana to be buried in the Spencer family vault at the local church in nearby [[Great Brington]], but Lord Spencer said that he was concerned about public safety and security and the onslaught of visitors that might overwhelm Great Brington. He decided that Diana would be buried where her grave could be easily cared for and visited in privacy by William, Harry, and other Spencer relatives.<ref name=sht6sep>{{cite news|title=Burial site offers princess a privacy elusive in life|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=doAfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=kH0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=6658,1380599&dq=burial+of+princess+diana&hl=en|accessdate=29 June 2015|newspaper=Sarasota Herald Tribune|date=6 September 1997}}</ref>

In November 2004, the case was settled out of court with the Memorial Fund agreeing to pay £13.5 million (US$21.5 million) to charitable causes on which both sides agreed. In addition to this, the Memorial Fund had spent a total of close to £4 million (US$6.5 million) in costs and fees relating to this litigation, and as a result froze grants allocated to a number of charities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4537799.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; Business &#124; Diana's lost millions |publisher=BBC |last=Datar |first=Rajan |date=11 November 2004|accessdate=2 April 2009}}</ref>

The [[Concert for Diana]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] was held on 1 July 2007.

In 2013, a previously unseen photograph of the then already officially engaged Diana was put up for auction. The picture belonged to the ''Daily Mirror'' newspaper, and has "Not to be published" written on it.

On 19 March 2013, ten of Diana's dresses, including a midnight blue velvet gown she wore to a 1985 [[state dinner]] at the [[White House]] when she famously danced with [[John Travolta]] (which became known as the [[Travolta dress]]), raised over £800,000 at auction in London.<ref>{{cite news|title=Princess Diana's dresses raise over £800,000 at auction|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9941199/Princess-Dianas-dresses-raise-over-800000-at-auction.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=20 March 2013|location=London|first1=Belinda|last1=White|date=19 March 2013}}</ref>

Immediately after her death, many sites around the world became briefly ''ad hoc'' memorials to Diana where the public left flowers and other tributes. The largest was outside the gates of Kensington Palace, where people continue to leave flowers and tributes. Permanent memorials include:
* The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Gardens in Regent Centre Gardens [[Kirkintilloch]]
* The [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain]] in [[Hyde Park, London]], opened by [[Elizabeth II]]
* The [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground]] in [[Kensington Gardens]], London

===Diana in contemporary art===
Diana has been depicted in [[contemporary art]] before and after her death.

In July 1999, [[Tracey Emin]] created a number of monoprint drawings featuring textual references about Diana's public and private life for ''Temple of Diana'', a themed exhibition at The Blue Gallery, London. Works such as ''They Wanted You To Be Destroyed'' (1999)<ref>Work illustrated on page 21 of Neal Brown's book ''Tracey Emin (Tate's Modern Artists Series)'' (London: Tate, 2006) ISBN 1-85437-542-3</ref> related to Diana's [[bulimia]], while others included affectionate texts such as ''Love Was on Your Side'' and Diana's ''Dress with puffy sleeves''. Another text praised her selflessness – ''The things you did to help other people'', showing Diana in protective clothing walking through a minefield in Angola – while [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales conspiracy theories#Conspiracy theories in contemporary art|another]] referenced the conspiracy theories. Of her drawings, Emin maintained "They're quite sentimental&nbsp;... and there's nothing cynical about it whatsoever."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/arts-and-culture/2009/07/tracey-emin-art-melodramatic|title=The tent is empty|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=16 July 2009|work=[[New Statesman]]|accessdate=15 February 2016}}</ref>

In 2005, [[Martín Sastre]] premiered during the [[Venice Biennale]] the film ''[[Diana: The Rose Conspiracy]]''. This fictional work starts with the world discovering Diana alive and enjoying a happy undercover new life in a dangerous [[cantegril]] on the outskirts of [[Montevideo]].

* '''28 August 1996 – 31 August 1997''': Diana, Princess of Wales

Posthumously, as in life, she is most popularly referred to as "Princess Diana", a title not formally correct and one she never held.{{efn|Often used by the public and media, the style "Princess Diana" is incorrect. With rare exceptions by permission of the Sovereign (such as [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]]), only women born to the title (such as [[Anne, Princess Royal|The Princess Anne]]) may use it before their given names. After her divorce in 1996, Diana was officially styled '''Diana, Princess of Wales''', having lost the prefix "[[Royal Highness|HRH]]".}} She is still sometimes referred to in the media as "Lady Diana Spencer" or simply as "Lady Di". In a speech after her death, then-Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] referred to Diana as the ''People's Princess''.<ref name="title3">{{Cite news|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1556863/Tony-coined-the-peoples-princess.html|title = Tony coined the 'people's princess{{'-}}|newspaper = The Daily Telegraph|location = London|date = 9 July 2007|accessdate = 23 June 2015}}</ref>
