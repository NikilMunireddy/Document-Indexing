'''Debrecen''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈdɛbrɛt͡sɛn|-|Hu-Debrecen.ogg}}; known by [[Names of European cities in different languages|alternative names]]) is the [[Cities of Hungary|second largest city]] in Hungary after [[Budapest]]. Debrecen is the regional centre of the [[Northern Great Plain]] [[Regions of Hungary|region]] and the seat of [[Hajdú-Bihar]] county. It was the largest Hungarian city in the 18th century<ref>Dezső Danyi-Zoltán Dávid: Az első magyarországi népszámlálás (1784-1787)/The first census in Hungary (1784-1787), Hungarian Central Statistical Office, Budapest, 1960</ref> and it is one of the most important cultural centres of the [[Hungarians]].<ref name="Papp">Antal Papp: Magyarország (Hungary), Panoráma, Budapest, 1982, ISBN 963 243 241 X, p. 860, pp. 463-477</ref> Debrecen was also the [[List of historical capitals of Hungary|capital city of Hungary]] during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|revolution in 1848-1849]]. During the revolution, the dethronement of the Habsburg dynasty was declared in the [[Reformed Great Church of Debrecen|Reformed Great Church]]. The city also served as the capital of Hungary by the end of the [[World War II]] in 1944-1945.<ref name="Papp"/>

== Name ==
The city was first mentioned by the name "Debrezun" in 1235. The name derived from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word "debresin", which means "live" or "move" and it is also a male given name.<ref>[http://www.lilla-debrecen.sulinet.hu/debrecen.html History of Debrecen (Hungarian)]</ref> Other theory says the name is of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] origin meaning well-esteemed (Polish: Dobrze cenione). In other languages, the name of the city varies more in spelling than in pronunciation: [[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''Debreţin'', [[German language|German]] ''Debrezin'', [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ''Debrecin'', [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''Debrecín''.

==Climate==
Debrecen, typical of Central Europe, has a climate on the boundaries of [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'') and [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] (''Dfb'').

== Economy ==

[[File:Forum Debrecen.JPG|thumb|Forum Debrecen]]
The development of Debrecen is mainly financed by agricultural, health care and educational business. The city is the main center of shopping in the east of Hungary. Forum Debrecen is the largest shopping mall in the region. Debrecen is one of the highest developed cities in Hungary, regional center of international companies, like [[National Instruments]], IT services and health product manufactures (Teva).

== Location ==

Debrecen is located on the [[Great Alföld|Great Hungarian Plain]], {{convert|220|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} east of Budapest. Situated nearby is the [[Hortobágy National Park]].

==Transport==
The city used to be somewhat isolated from Budapest, Hungary's main transport hub. However, the completion of the motorway [[M35 motorway (Hungary)|M35]] means Budapest can now be reached in under two hours. [[Debrecen International Airport|Debrecen Airport]] (the second largest in Hungary) has recently undergone modernisation in order to be able to handle more international flights, although almost all flights to and from Hungary still use Budapest's [[Budapest Ferihegy International Airport|Ferihegy Airport]] (now called Budapest Ferenc Liszt International Airport). Cities that can be reached from the Debrecen Airport include [[Brussels]], [[Eindhoven]], [[London]], [[Malmö]], [[Milan]] and [[Paris]]. The closest airport with scheduled flights in terms of distance is [[Oradea Airport]] in Romania 1 hour and 20 minutes away from Debrecen. There have also been improvements to some parts of the railway between the capital and Debrecen as part of Hungary's mainly [[European Union|EU]]-funded National Development Plan for 2004 to 2006. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

There are many railway stations in Debrecen, the most significant is the main station of Debrecen, in addition other smaller stations exist, these include Debrecen-Csapókert, Debrecen-Kondoros, Debrecen-Szabadságtelep and Tócóvölgy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elvira.mav-start.hu/ |title=MÁV-START :: ELVIRA - belföldi vasúti utastájékoztatás |publisher=Elvira.mav-start.hu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>

Debrecen's proximity to [[Ukraine]] and [[Romania]] enables it to develop as an important trade centre and transport hub for the wider international region.

Local transport in the city consists of [[buses]], [[trolleybuses]], and [[trams]]. It is provided by the [[Public transport in Debrecen|DKV]] (''Debreceni Közlekedési Vállalat'', or ''Transport Company of Debrecen''). Nearby towns and villages are linked to the city by [[Public transport in Debrecen|Hajdú Volán]] bus services.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Debrecen}}
[[File:Debrecen Piac utca old.jpg|left|thumb|Piac Street in 1910s]]
[[File:Debrecen town square.jpg|left|thumb|Downtown]]
[[File:Debrecen-bocskai.jpg|thumb|[[Stephen Bocskay]] was a Hungarian noble from [[Transylvania]].]]
The settlement was established after the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|Hungarian conquest]].<ref name="Papp"/> Debrecen became more important after some of the small villages of the area (Boldogasszonyfalva, Szentlászlófalva) deserted due to the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]]. It experienced rapid development after the middle of the 13th century.<ref name="Papp"/>

In 1361, [[Louis I of Hungary]] granted the citizens of Debrecen the right to choose the town's judge and council. This provided some opportunities for self-government for the town. By the early 16th century, Debrecen was an important market town.<ref name="Papp"/>

King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], as part of a treaty with [[Serbia]]n ruler [[Stefan Lazarević]], gave him the opportunity to rule Debrecen in September 1411. A year after Lazarević's death in 1426, his role was taken over by his successor, [[Đurađ Branković]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Between 1450 and 1507, it was a domain of the [[Hunyadi family]].<ref name="Papp"/>

During the Ottoman period, being close to the border and having no castle or city walls, Debrecen often found itself in difficult situations and the town was saved only by the diplomatic skills of its leaders. Sometimes the town was protected by the Ottoman Empire, sometimes by the Catholic European rulers or by [[Francis II Rákóczi]], prince of [[Transylvania]]. Debrecen later embraced the [[Protestant Reformation]] quite early, earning the monikers "the Calvinist Rome" and "the [[Geneva]] of Hungary". At this period the inhabitants of the town were mainly Hungarian [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. Debrecen became a [[sanjak]] between 1541 and 1693 and orderly bounded to the [[eyalet]]s of Budin (1541–1596), [[Eger|Eğri]] (1596–1660) and [[Oradea|Varat]] (1660–1693) as "Debreçin".

In 1693, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]] elevated Debrecen to [[free royal town]] status. In 1715, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] returned to Debrecen, and the town gave them a place to build a church, so the Piarist monks could build the St. Ann's Cathedral. By this time the town was an important cultural, commercial and agricultural centre, and many future scholars and poets attended its Protestant College (a predecessor of today's [[University of Debrecen]] and also of [[Debrecen Reformed Theological University]]).

In 1849, Debrecen was the capital of Hungary for a short time when the Hungarian revolutionary government fled there from Pest-Buda (modern-day Budapest).<ref name="Papp"/> In April 1849, the dethronization of Habsburgs (neglected after the fall of the revolution) and the independence of Hungary was proclaimed here by [[Lajos Kossuth]] at the Great (Calvinist) Church (''Nagytemplom'' in Hungarian.) The last battle of the war of independence was also close to Debrecen. The Russians, allied to Habsburgs, defeated the Hungarian army close to the western part of the town.

[[File:Ref. Nagytemplom (5233. számú műemlék) 11.jpg|thumb|[[Protestant Great Church of Debrecen|The Great Church]]]]

After the war, Debrecen slowly began to prosper again. In 1857, the railway line between Budapest and Debrecen was completed, and Debrecen soon became a railway junction. New schools, hospitals, churches, factories, and mills were built, banks and insurance companies settled in the city. The appearance of the city began to improve too: with new, taller buildings, parks and beautiful villas it no longer resembled a provincial town and began to look like a modern city. In 1884, Debrecen became the first Hungarian city to have a steam tramway.

After [[World War I]], Hungary lost a considerable portion of its eastern territory to [[Romania]], and Debrecen once again became situated close to the border of the country. It was occupied by the Romanian army for a short time in 1919. Tourism provided a way for the city to begin to prosper again. Many buildings (among them an indoor swimming pool and Hungary's first stadium) were built in the central park, the ''Nagyerdő'' ("Big Forest"), providing recreational facilities. The building of the university was completed. Hortobágy, a large pasture owned by the city, became a tourist attraction.

[[File:Déri Múzeum (5226. számú műemlék) 8.jpg|thumb|left|Déri Museum]]

During [[World War II]], Debrecen was almost completely destroyed, 70% of the buildings suffered damage, 50% of them were completely destroyed. A major battle involving combined arms, including several hundred tanks ([[Battle of Debrecen]]), occurred near the city in October 1944. After 1944, the reconstruction began and Debrecen became the capital of Hungary for a short time once again.<ref name="Papp"/> The citizens began to rebuild their city, trying to restore its pre-war status, but the new, Communist government of Hungary had other plans. The institutions and estates of the city were taken into public ownership, private property was taken away. This forced change of the old system brought new losses to Debrecen; half of its area was annexed to nearby towns, and the city also lost its rights over Hortobágy. In 1952, two new villages – [[Ebes]] and [[Nagyhegyes]] – were formed from former parts of Debrecen, while in 1981, the nearby village [[Debrecen-Józsa|Józsa]] was annexed to the city. The newly built blocks of flats provided housing for those who lost their homes during the war. In the following decades, Debrecen was the third largest city of Hungary (behind Budapest and [[Miskolc]]), and became the second largest in the 1990s when the population of Miskolc decreased.

From the 16th century, the Reformation took roots in the city, first Lutheranism, later [[John Calvin|Calvin]]'s teachings become predominant. From 1551, the Calvinist government of the city banned the moving of Catholics in Debrecen. Catholic churches were taken over by the Reformed church. In 1552, the Catholic faith vanished in the city, until 1715 when they regained a church. Several Reformed church leaders like Peter Melius Juhasz who translated the Genevan Psalms lived and worked here. In 1567, a synod was formed in the city when the [[Second Helvetic Confession]] was adopted. Famous Reformed Colleges and schools were formed. Nickname of Debrecen commonly used in Hungary is the ''Calvinist Rome'' because of the great percentage of the Reformed faith in the city as well as the Reformed church has significant influence in the city and the region. Debrecen is the home of the Reformed Theological University of Debrecen. (Debreceni Református Hittudományi Egyetem).<ref>http://www.drhe.hu/</ref> The Reformed Theological University was founded in 1538. This was the only Reformed Theological Institute that was allowed to function in Hungary during the communism.<ref>http://www.drhe.hu/egyetemunk</ref><ref>[http://ttre.hu/egyhazkerulet/a-kerulet-tortenete A kerület története - Egyházkerület - Tiszántúli Református Egyházkerület<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6823/ Reformatus.hu | History of the RCH<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The Hungarian Reformed Church has about 20 congregations in Debrecen, included the famous [[Reformed Great Church of Debrecen]] which can easily accommodates about 5000 people (with 3000 seats).<ref>http://www.derefem.hu/index.php?option=com_wrapper&view=wrapper&Itemid=315</ref>

===Jewish community===
[[File:Debrecen-Synagogue.jpg|thumb|The main synagogue in the center of the city]]

Jews were first allowed to settle in Debrecen in 1814, with an initial population count of 118 men within 4 years.
Twenty years later, they were allowed to purchase land and homes. By 1919, they consisted 10% of the population (with over 10,000 community members listed) and owned almost half of the large properties in and around the town.<ref name="KB">Debrecen Kehilla book, pp. 12-14</ref>

The Hungarian antisemitic laws of 1938 caused many businesses to close, and in 1939 many Jews were drafted into forced labor groups and sent to the Ukraine, where many died in minefields.<ref name="KB"/>

In 1940, the Germans estimated that 12,000 Jews were left in the town. In 1941, Jews of Galician and Polish origin were expelled, reducing the number of Jews to 9142. In 1942, more Jews were drafted into the Hungarian forced labor groups and sent to the Ukraine.

German forces entered the city on March 20, 1944, (Two and a half weeks before Passover) ordering a Judenrat (Jewish Council) headed by Rabbi Pal (Meir) Weisz, and a Jewish police squad was formed, headed by former army captain Bela Lusztbaum. On March 30, 1944, (a week before Passover) the Jews were ordered to wear the Yellow star of David. Jewish cars were confiscated and phone lines cut. During the Passover week, many Jewish dignitaries were taken to a nearby prison camp, eventually reaching the number of 300 prisoners. A week later all Jewish stores were closed, and a public book-burning of Jewish books was presided by the antisemitic newspaper editor Mihaly Kalosvari Borska.  {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

An order to erect a ghetto was issued on April 28, 1944, in the name of the town mayor Sandor Kolscey, who opposed the act, and was ousted by the Germans. Jews were forced to build the Ghetto walls, finishing it within less than a month on May 15, 1944.

On June 7, 1944, all movement in or out of the Ghetto was prohibited and a week later all Debrecen Jews were deported to the nearby Serly brickyards, and stripped of their belongings, joining Jews from other areas.<ref name="EJ">[https://books.google.com/books?id=MFn3KeENnA0C&pg=PA481 The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust] On the Hajdúböszörmény jail camp</ref>

Ten families of prominent Jews, including those of Rabbi Weisz and orthodox chief Rabbi Strasser, along with the heads of the Zionist (non orthodox) movement joined the [[Kasztner train]]. (According to some sources, the Strasshoff camps were filled with Jews for negotiations in case the Germans could receive something for releasing these Jews, among them 6841 from Debrecen.) 298 of these Debrecen Jews were shot by the SS in Bavaria, after being told they would reach [[Theresienstadt]].  Some young Debrecen Jews escaped the town, led by the high school principal Adoniyahu Billitzer and reached Budapest, joining resistance movements and partisans.<ref name="EJ"/>

Most of the remaining Debrecen Jews were deported to Auschwitz, reaching there on July 3, 1944.
Debrecen was liberated by the Soviet Army on 20 October 1944. Some 4,000 Jews of Debrecen and its surroundings survived the war, creating a community of 4,640 in 1946 - the largest in the region. About 400 of those moved to Israel, and many others moved to the west by 1970, with 1,200 Jews left in the town, using two synagogues, one of them established prior to [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Eugene KATZ |url=http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/Debrecen/ |title=Shtetlinks on Debrecen |publisher=Shtetlinks.jewishgen.org |date= |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref>

== Culture ==
[[File:A Debreceni Egyetem TEK főépülete.JPG|left|thumb|The main building of the [[University of Debrecen]].]]
Chiefly thanks to the reformation and the prestigious Calvinist College, founded in 1538, Debrecen has been the intellectual and cultural centre of the surrounding area since the 16th century. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Over the centuries, the College was transformed into a University and its intellectual life developed a sphere of influence between [[Eger]] and [[Oradea]] (Hu: ''Nagyvárad'', now in [[Romania]]). In 1949-1950, several departments of the University were shut down, due to Communist takeover, with many students and teachers being expelled. The [[University of Debrecen]], as it is now called is still widely recognized work of architecture (mostly thanks to its main building). The university has many departments and is a major research facility in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unideb.hu/portal/en/node/19 |title=History of the University &#124; Debreceni Egyetem |publisher=Unideb.hu |date=2000-01-01 |accessdate=2012-12-25}}</ref> The University is well known for the cactus research laboratory in the botanic gardens behind the main building.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Debrecen press attracted several notable figures to the city. [[Endre Ady]], [[Gyula Krúdy]], and [[Árpád Tóth]] all began their journalistic careers in Debrecen. Prominent literary figures from the city have included [[Magda Szabó]], and {{Ill|hu|Gábor Oláh|Oláh Gábor (költő)}}. One of Hungary's best known poets, [[Mihály Csokonai Vitéz]], was born and lived in the city. The city's theatre, built in 1865, was named in his honour in 1916, but can trace its roots back to the National Theatre Company founded in Debrecen in 1789, which at first gave performances in the carthouse of an inn. Celebrated actress [[Blaha Lujza tér (Budapest Metro)|Lujza Blaha]] is among those to have performed there.<ref>[http://csokonaiszinhaz.hu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=185%3Aa-szinhaz&catid=3%3Astatikus&Itemid=2 Csokonai Nemzeti Színház - Debrecen<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Debrecen has a flourishing music scene {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} and is home to [[Tankcsapda]], one of Hungary's most popular and successful rock bands. There is also a rock school in the city offer training and mentoring to young musicians. Classic media in the city include the newspaper Napló, two TV channels, a range of local radio stations and several companies and associations producing media material.
