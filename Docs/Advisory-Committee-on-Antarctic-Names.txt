Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names

The '''Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names''' ('''ACAN''' or '''US-ACAN''') is an advisory committee of the [[United States Board on Geographic Names]] responsible for recommending names for features in [[Antarctica]]. The [[United States]] does not recognise territorial boundaries within Antarctica, so ACAN will assign names to features anywhere within the continent, in consultation with other national nomenclatural bodies where appropriate.

ACAN has a published policy on naming, based on priority of application, appropriateness, and the extent to which usage has become established.<ref name=gnis>[http://geonames.usgs.gov/antex.html Policy Covering Antarctic Names]</ref>
