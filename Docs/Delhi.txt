It has been captured, ransacked and rebuilt several times, particularly during the medieval period, and modern Delhi is a cluster of a number of cities spread across the metropolitan region.

Delhi and its urban region have been given the special status of [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] (NCR) under the [[Constitution of India]]'s 69th Amendment Act of 1991. The NCR includes the neighbouring cities of [[Faridabad]], [[Gurgaon]], [[Noida]], [[Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh|Ghaziabad]], [[Neharpar]] (Greater Faridabad), [[Greater Noida]], [[Bahadurgarh]], [[Sonepat]], [[Panipat]], [[Karnal]], [[Rohtak]], [[Bhiwani]], [[Rewari]], [[Baghpat]], [[Meerut]], [[Muzaffarnagar]], [[Alwar]], [[Bharatpur, Rajasthan|Bharatpur]] and other nearby towns. A [[union territory]], the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely resembles that of a [[States of India|state]] of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a [[Chief Minister of Delhi|Chief Minister]]. New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal [[government of India]] and the local [[government of Delhi]], and is the capital of the NCT of Delhi.

==Toponomy==

There are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name ''Delhi''. One of them is derived from ''Dhillu'' or ''Dilu'', a king who built a city at this location in 50&nbsp;BC and named it after himself.<ref name=ecosurv1>{{cite web

The area around Delhi was probably inhabited before the second millennium BC and there is evidence of continuous inhabitation since at least the 6th century BC.<ref name=asherhabit/> The city is believed to be the site of Indraprastha, the legendary capital of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata.<ref name=ecosurv1/> According to Mahabharata, this land was initially a huge mass of forests called 'Khandavaprastha' which was burnt down to build the city of Indraprastha. The earliest architectural relics date back to the [[Maurya]] period (c. 300 BC); in 1966, an inscription of the Mauryan [[Emperor Ashoka]] (273–235 BC) was discovered near Srinivaspuri. Remains of eight major cities have been discovered in Delhi. The first five cities were in the southern part of present-day Delhi. Gurjara-pratihara King [[Anang Pal]] of the [[Tomara dynasty]] founded the city of [[Lal Kot]] in AD 736. The [[Chauhan]]s conquered Lal Kot in 1180 and renamed it [[Qila Rai Pithora]].

On the death of Muhammad in 1206, the Turkic slave-general, [[Qutb-ud-din Aibak]], broke away from the [[Ghurid Dynasty]] and became the first [[Sultan of Delhi]]. He began construction of the [[Qutb Minar]] and [[Quwwat-al-Islam]] (might of Islam) mosque, the earliest extant mosque in India.

Under the second Khilji ruler, [[Ala-ud-din Khilji]], the Delhi sultanate extended its control south of the [[Narmada River]] in the Deccan. The Delhi sultanate reached its greatest extent during the reign of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] (1325–1351). In an attempt to bring the whole of the Deccan under control, he moved his capital to [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra]] in central India. However, by moving away from Delhi he lost control of the north and was forced to return to Delhi to restore order. The southern provinces then broke away. In the years following the reign of [[Firoz Shah Tughlaq]] (1351–1388), the [[Delhi sultanate]] rapidly began to lose its hold over its northern provinces.

Under the Afghan [[Lodhi dynasty]] (1451–1526), the Delhi sultanate recovered control of the Punjab and the Gangetic plain to once again achieve domination over Northern India. However, the recovery was short-lived and the sultanate was destroyed in 1526 by [[Babur]], founder of the [[Mughal dynasty]].

[[Babur]], was a descendant of [[Descent from Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan]] and Timur, from the Fergana Valley in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]].

Delhi is located at {{coord|28.61|N|77.23|E|display=inline}}, and lies in [[North India|Northern India]]. It borders the Indian states of [[Haryana]] on the north, west and south and [[Uttar Pradesh]] (UP) to the east. Two prominent features of the geography of Delhi are the Yamuna flood plains and the [[Delhi ridge]]. The [[Yamuna river]] was the historical boundary between Punjab and UP, and its flood plains provide fertile alluvial soil suitable for agriculture but are prone to recurrent floods. The Yamuna, a sacred river in Hinduism, is the only major river flowing through Delhi. The [[Hindon River]] separates Ghaziabad from the eastern part of Delhi. The Delhi ridge originates from the [[Aravalli Range]] in the south and encircles the west, north-east and north-west parts of the city. It reaches a height of {{convert|318|m|ft|abbr=on}} and is a dominant feature of the region.<ref name=gisridge>{{cite web

The [[Circles of Sustainability]] assessment of Delhi gives a marginally more favourable impression of the ecological sustainability of the city only because it is based on a more comprehensive series of measures than only air pollution. Part of the reason that the city remains assessed at basic sustainability is because of the low resource-use and [[carbon emissions]] of its poorer neighbourhoods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process |title=Circles of Sustainability Urban Profile Process |publisher=The Cities Programme |date=2012-07-27 |accessdate=2014-05-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131112175841/http://citiesprogramme.com/archives/resource/circles-of-sustainability-urban-profile-process |archivedate=12 November 2013 }}</ref>

===Road===

Delhi has the highest road density of 2103&nbsp;km/100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in [[India]].

Buses are the most popular means of road transport catering to about 60% of Delhi's total demand. Delhi has one of India's largest bus transport systems. Buses are operated by the state-owned [[Delhi Transport Corporation]] (DTC), which owns the largest fleet of [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG)-fueled buses in the world. Personal vehicles especially cars also form a major chunk of vehicles plying on Delhi roads. Delhi has the highest number of registered cars compared to any other metropolitan city in India. Taxis, auto rickshaws and cycle rickshaws also ply on Delhi roads in large numbers.

'''Important Roads in Delhi'''

Some roads and expressways serve as important pillars of Delhi's road infrastructure:

* Inner [[Ring Road]] is one of the most important "state highways" in Delhi. It is a 51&nbsp;km long circular road which connects important areas in Delhi. Owing to more than 2 dozen grade-separators/flyovers, the road is almost signal-free.
* Outer [[Ring Road]] is another major artery in Delhi that links far-flung areas of Delhi.
* The Delhi Noida Direct Flyway ([[DND Flyway]]) is an eight-laned access controlled tolled expressway which connects Delhi to [[Noida]] (an important satellite city of [[Uttar Pradesh]]). The acronym DND stands for "Delhi-Noida Direct".
* The [[Delhi Gurgaon Expressway]] is a 28&nbsp;km (17&nbsp;mi) expressway connecting Delhi to [[Gurgaon]], an important satellite city of [[Haryana]].
* The [[Delhi Faridabad Skyway]] is controlled tolled expressway which connects Delhi to [[Faridabad]], an important satellite city of [[Haryana]].

'''National Highways Passing Through Delhi'''

Delhi is connected by Road to various parts of the country through several National Highways:

* [[National Highway 1 (India)]] or (NH 1) is a National Highway in Northern India that links the National capital [[New Delhi]] to the town of Attari in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] near the Indo-Pakistan border.
* [[National Highway 2 (India)]] (NH 2) commonly referred as Delhi-[[Kolkata]] Road is a busy Indian National Highway that runs through the states of Delhi, [[Haryana]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]] and [[West Bengal]].
* [[National Highway 8 (India)]] (NH 8) is a National Highway in India that connects the Indian capital city of New Delhi with the Indian Financial capital city of Mumbai.
* [[National Highway 10 (India)]] (NH 10) is a National Highway in northern India that originates at Delhi and ends at the town of Fazilka in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] near the Indo-Pakistan border.
* National Highway 24 (India) (NH 24) is a National Highway in India that connects the National capital Delhi to [[Uttar Pradesh]] state capital Lucknow running {{convert|438|km|mi|abbr=off}} in length.

===Metro ===

The [[Delhi Metro]] is a rapid transit system serving Delhi, [[Faridabad]], [[Gurgaon]], [[Noida]] and [[Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh|Ghaziabad]] in the National Capital Region of India. Delhi Metro is the world's 10th largest metro system in terms of length. Delhi Metro was India's first modern public transportation system which has revolutionised travel by providing a fast, reliable, safe, and comfortable means of transport. The network consists of six lines with a total length of {{convert|189.63|km|mi|abbr=off}} with 142 stations, of which 35 are underground, five are at-grade, and the remainder are elevated. All stations have escalators, elevators, and tactile tiles to guide the visually impaired from station entrances to trains. It has a combination of elevated, at-grade, and underground lines, and uses both broad gauge and standard gauge rolling stock. Four types of rolling stock are used: Mitsubishi-ROTEM Broad gauge, Bombardier MOVIA, Mitsubishi-ROTEM Standard gauge, and CAF Beasain Standard gauge. The Phase-I of Delhi Metro was built at a cost of US$2.3&nbsp;billion and the Phase-II was expected to cost an additional {{INRConvert|216|b}}.<ref name="Bloomberg.com: Opinion"/> Phase-II has a total length of 128&nbsp;km and was completed by 2010.<ref name="Economictimes.indiatimes.com"/> [[Delhi Metro]] completed 10&nbsp;years of operation on 25 December 2012. It carries millions of passengers every day.<ref name="10 years of Delhi Metro"/> In addition to the Delhi Metro, a suburban railway, the [[Delhi Suburban Railway]] exists.<ref name="Indian Express"/>

Delhi Metro is being built and operated by the [[Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited]] (DMRC), a state-owned company with equal equity participation from Government of India and Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi. However, the organisation is under administrative control of Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India. Besides construction and operation of Delhi Metro, DMRC is also involved in the planning and implementation of metro rail, monorail and high-speed rail projects in India and providing consultancy services to other metro projects in the country as well as abroad. The Delhi Metro project was spearheaded by [[Padma Vibhushan]] [[E. Sreedharan]], the Managing Director of DMRC and popularly known as the "Metro Man" of India. He famously resigned from DMRC taking moral responsibility for a metro bridge collapse which took five lives. Sreedharan was awarded with the prestigious [[Legion of Honour]] by the French Government for his contribution to Delhi Metro.

Metro services are being extended to important hubs in the cities which are close to offices, colleges and tourist spots. This will facilitate easy conveyance for the citizens, who otherwise have to rely on public buses which are heavily crowded and are often stuck in traffic jams.

===Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS)===
The 08 RRTS Corridors have been proposed by National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) to facilitate the people travelling from nearby cities in NCR to Delhi. The three main corridors in first phase are as follows which are expected to become operational before 2019:
# '''Delhi - [[Alwar]]''' via Gurgaon
# '''Delhi - [[Panipat]]''' via Sonepat
# '''Delhi - [[Meerut]]''' via Ghaziabad

Remaining five corridors are also approved by National Capital Region Planning Board but are planned in the second phase.

To make the project operational NCRPB has formed a separate body named as "[[National Capital Region Transport Corporation]]'' on the lines of DMRC to independently formalise and monitor its progress.
