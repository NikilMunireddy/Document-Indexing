The '''American Airlines Center''' ('''AAC''') is a multi-purpose [[arena]], located in the [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]] neighborhood, near [[downtown Dallas|downtown]] [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].

The venue serves as the home to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] of the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[Dallas Stars]] of the [[National Hockey League]]. The arena is also used for concerts and other live entertainment. It opened in 2001 at a cost of $420 million.

==History and construction==
By 1998, the Dallas Mavericks, then owned by [[H. Ross Perot, Jr.]], and the Dallas Stars were indicating their desire for a new facility to replace the dated [[Reunion Arena]]. Dallas taxpayers approved a new hotel tax and rental car tax to pay for a new facility to cover a portion of the funding, with the two benefiting teams, the Mavericks and the Stars, picking up the remaining costs, including cost overruns. The new arena was to be built just north of [[State Highway Spur 366 (Texas)|Woodall Rodgers Freeway]] near [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] on the site of an old [[power plant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanairlinescenter.com/about-aacenter/overview.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 23, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140129193627/http://www.americanairlinescenter.com:80/about-aacenter/overview.php |archivedate=January 29, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Brick |first=Michael |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/01/business/commercial-real-estate-downtown-dallas-project-mired-in-disputes.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm |title=COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE - Downtown Dallas Project Mired in Disputes |location=Dallas (Tex) |website=NYTimes.com |date=2002-05-01 |accessdate=2016-05-27}}</ref>

On March 18, 1999, [[American Airlines]] announced that it would be acquiring the naming rights for the arena for US$195 million.<ref>{{cite web | publisher=American Airlines Center | url=http://www.americanairlinescenter.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/Page/PageID/73/ArticleID/126 | title=American and the Arena Group Announce Agreement To Name New Dallas Facility American Airlines Center | accessdate=25 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher=American Airlines Center | url=http://www.americanairlinescenter.com/index.cfm/FuseAction/Page/PageID/73/ArticleID/71 | title=Owners Add Upgrades to American Airlines Center | accessdate=25 October 2006}}</ref> American Airlines is headquartered in Fort Worth and is based at [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]].

On July 27, 2001, the facility opened with the largest [[ribbon-cutting ceremony]] ever, according to the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of Records]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The first event occurred the next day with an [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] concert. On the next night, the arena hosted the last show of [[Michael Flatley|Michael Flatley's]] [[Feet of Flames]] tour. The first sporting event took place on August 19, 2001, with the [[Dallas Sidekicks (1984–2004)|Dallas Sidekicks]] of the [[World Indoor Soccer League]] taking on the [[San Diego Sockers (2001–2004)|San Diego Sockers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kicksfan.com/2001/box/season/game1.htm |title=2001 Season Opening Night: Dallas Sidekicks 6 San Diego Sockers 5 (OT) at the American Airlines Center |website=Kicksfan.com |date=2001-08-19 |accessdate=2016-05-27}}</ref>

==Design==

Principal design work was carried out by [[David M. Schwarz]] Architectural Services of [[Washington D.C.]] [[American Airlines]] Center was designed to be the heart of a new urban, commercial area designed to reinvigorate the city of Dallas called [[Victory Park, Dallas, Texas|Victory Park]]. The facility itself features a conservative, traditional design with sweeping brick façades and smooth arches, and has been graced with a number of awards (below). The interior includes retractable seating, public art and a state-of-the-art technological arena. Because of the [[Quonset hut]]-like appearance of its roof and the fact that American Airlines holds the naming rights some fans have come to refer to it as "The Hangar".

On the south side of the arena [[AT&T Inc.|AT&T]] Plaza (also called Victory Plaza) serves as the principal entrance into the facility, designed by artist [[Athena Tacha]] in 2000. The plaza provides an open space with fountains flanked by retail and office buildings. With several [[high-definition video]] displays from [[Daktronics]] mounted on the side of the arena and office buildings, the plaza is often used for outdoor events and movie showings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Entertainment Venue – American Airlines Center|url=http://www.americanairlinescenter.com/about-aacenter/att_plaza.php|publisher=American Airlines Center|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}</ref>
