'''Association Sportive de Monaco Football Club'''  (commonly referred to as  '''AS Monaco''' ({{IPA-fr|ɑ ɛs monako|pron}}) or simply '''Monaco''') is a French-registered [[Monaco]]-based [[association football|football club]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asm-fc.com/en/article/the-origins-1919-1930-62951.html |title=The origins (1919–1930) |publisher=AS Monaco FC |accessdate=17 October 2013}}</ref> The club was founded in 1919 and plays in [[Ligue 1]], the top tier of [[Football in France|French football]]. The team plays its home matches at the [[Stade Louis II]] in [[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]]. Monaco is managed by [[Leonardo Jardim]] and is [[Captain (association football)|captained]] by [[Jérémy Toulalan]].

Though based in Monaco, the club plays in the [[French football league system]]. Monaco is one of the most [[List of French football champions|successful clubs]] in France, having won seven league titles and five [[Coupe de France]] trophies. The club has also competed in [[European football]] having been runners-up in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] in [[1992 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1992]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[2004 UEFA Champions League Final|2004]].

The club's traditional colours are red and white, and the club is known as ''Les Rouges et Blancs'' (''The Red and Whites''). Monaco is also a member of the [[European Club Association]]. In December 2011, two-thirds of the club was sold to an investment group led by Russian billionaire [[Dmitry Rybolovlev]].<ref name=BBC>{{cite news|title=Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev takes over Monaco|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/16322948|accessdate=2 April 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=23 December 2011}}</ref> With Rybolovlev's financial backing, the club quickly returned to Ligue 1.

== History ==

===Early history===
AS Monaco FC was founded on 1 August 1919 <ref>{{[cite web|url=http://www.asmonaco.com/en/article/the-origins-1919-1930-62951.html}}</ref> as a unification of numerous local clubs based in France and the [[Monaco|principality]]. The club's early years were spent in the amateur regional divisions of the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]], rising rapidly between the leagues in the 1920bbhs. In 1933, Monaco were invited by the [[French Football Federation]] to turn professional. The Monégasques' first year of [[Ligue 2|second division football]] ended in failure however, as they were relegated to the amateur leagues the following year. By 1948, Monaco re-acquired its professional status and returned to the French second division; they subsequently consistently finished in its upper echelons, with this sustained effort resulting in promotion to the French [[Ligue 1|first division]] for the first time in 1953.

===Domestic successes (1960–1986)===
[[File:Lucien Leduc.jpg|thumb|[[Lucien Leduc]] guided Monaco to three league titles and two domestic cups]]
In 1960, Monaco's first iconic coach, [[Lucien Leduc]], led the club to its first professional trophy, the [[Coupe de France]], beating [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] 4–2 in [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]]. This initial success was bettered in the following year with the club winning the [[Ligue 1|French Championship]] for the first time in its history, qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]]. Leduc subsequently led the club to its first League and Cup Double in 1963. Upon Leduc's departure in 1963, Monaco endured a barren run, entrenched in the middle half of the league for the best part of the next decade and alternating between the first and second divisions after 1963. In 1975, Jean-Louis Campora, son of former president Charles Campora, became chairman of the club. In his second season, he brought back Leduc, who immediately won the club promotion to the first division and won them the championship the following year in 1978. Leduc subsequently left the club again in 1979, to be succeeded by [[Lucien Muller]] and [[Gérard Banide]], both of whom were unable to halt the club's decline.

The early 1980s saw a steady stream of successes in national competitions. Monaco won a title almost every other year; the [[Coupe de France]] in 1980 and 1985, the [[Ligue 1|French Championship]] in 1982, was [[Coupe de France]] finalist in 1984. In the 1985–86 season, Monaco hammered [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] 9–0, one of the biggest wins in club history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchleague.com/club/historique.asp?no_affil_fff=500211 |title=Ligue1.com – French Football League – Ligue 1, Ligue 2, Coupe de la Ligue, Trophée des Champions |publisher=Frenchleague.com |date= |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>

Disappointingly for Monaco fans, the club could not translate its domestic leadership into European success. Up to this point, Monaco had never passed the first round of any European competition. Monaco lost to [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] (1981) [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] twice (1982 and 1984) and [[FC Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bundesliga.weltfussball.at/teams/as-monaco/1986/3/ |title=AS Monaco – Dates & results 1985/1986 |publisher=Bundesliga.weltfussball.at |date= |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>

===1990s: Wenger and Tigana===

[[File:AS Monaco logo.svg|125px|thumb|right|The former AS Monaco logo used until 2013.]]
In 1986, famed [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] manager [[Ștefan Kovács]], who succeeded [[Rinus Michels]] and honed his [[Total Football]] ideals with the Dutch champions, came out of a three-year "retirement" to manage Monaco, but even he could not bring them success. With the club facing a second barren spell, they signed [[Arsène Wenger]], who had hitherto been relatively unknown, managing [[AS Nancy|Nancy]] without much success. Wenger's reign saw the club enjoy one of its most successful periods, with several inspired signings, including [[George Weah]], [[Glenn Hoddle]], [[Jürgen Klinsmann]], and [[Youri Djorkaeff]]. Youth team policies produced future World Cup winners [[Emmanuel Petit]], [[Lilian Thuram]] and [[Thierry Henry]]. Under Wenger, they won the league in his first season in charge (1988) and the Coupe de France in 1991, with the club consistently competing in the latter stages of the European Cup and regularly challenging for the league title.<ref name="rees-guardian">{{cite news

}}</ref> The club could have had even greater success in this period, as it emerged in 1993 that bitter rivals [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] had indulged in match fixing and numerous improprieties, a view that Wenger had long held.<ref name="rees-guardian"/> In 1994, after being blocked by the Monaco board from opening discussions with German powerhouse [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] for their vacant managerial post after being shortlisted for the role, Wenger was released from the club, several weeks after the post had already been filled.<ref name="rees-guardian"/><ref>''Arsène Wenger The Biography'' by Xavier Rivoire</ref>

After Wenger's departure, the club went on to record two further league championships; under [[Jean Tigana]] in [[1996–97 French Division 1|1997]] and under [[Claude Puel]] in [[1999–2000 French Division 1|2000]]. However, as the decade came to an end, rumours were surfacing that the club was facing numerous financial difficulties. In 2003, these financial problems came to a head. Despite finishing second in the league, the club was relegated to Ligue 2 by the French Professional League for amassing a €50 million ($68 million) debt.<ref name="SI-Lyttleton">{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/ben_lyttleton/01/22/monaco/index.html |title=Monaco struggling for survival |publisher=SI.com |date=23 January 2011|accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref> Whilst this was reduced on appeal to a ban on purchasing players, it was enough to force President Jean-Louis Campora, who had been in charge for 28 years, to step aside. He was replaced by Pierre Svara, an administrator considered to be close to the Principality's royal family but with no footballing experience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=78342.html#campora+quits+monaco+role |title=Campora quits Monaco role|publisher=uefa.com|date=30 June 2003|accessdate=24 April 2012}}</ref>

The following season saw remarkable success on the field, given the club's financial strife. The team, coached by former French national team captain [[Didier Deschamps]] and featuring stalwarts such as [[Fernando Morientes]], [[Ludovic Giuly]], [[Jérôme Rothen]] and [[Dado Pršo]], finished third in Ligue 1 and enjoyed a remarkable run to the final of the [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], beating [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] along the way. However, despite the on-field success, the 2003–04 season was the club's worst financial year in its history. Within 12 months, Deschamps had left as coach and Svara had been replaced by Michel Pastor.<ref name="SI-Lyttleton" />

===Relegation and takeover===
[[File:Dmitry Rybolovlev in 2012.jpg|thumb|Russian billionaire [[Dmitry Rybolovlev]] bought the club in 2011 and has made it one of the biggest spenders in the football world.]]
With [[Francesco Guidolin]] hired to replace Deschamps, one of Pastor's first tasks was to hold on to the players who had turned the club into one of the best in Europe. However, he failed to convince them to stay and their replacements were unable to replicate previous successes. Guidolin lasted only one year, before being replaced by assistant coach [[Laurent Banide]] who, in turn, only lasted a year, before being replaced by Brazilian [[Ricardo Gomes]]. In 2008, after four years at the club featuring six coaches and only mid-table finishes, Pastor left the club amid severe criticism of his management skills.

In 2008, [[Jérôme de Bontin]], a leading shareholder of the club since 2003, took charge of the club, promising a complete shake-up. Under his reign as president, the club brought in players such as [[Park Chu-Young]] and [[Freddy Adu]], so they did not find much success on the pitch, going through a torrid season and only managing a mid-table finish. De Bontin resigned at the end of the season, replaced by banker Étienne Franzi and a new board of directors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.fr/Football/foo/Ligue-1-Monaco-Etienne-Franzi-president-152330.shtm|title=Monaco: Etienne Franzi président|publisher=Sport.fr|date=21 March 2009|accessdate=9 September 2009}}</ref>

In July 2009, Ricardo Gomes was replaced by former [[AS Cannes|Cannes]] and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] coach [[Guy Lacombe]], inheriting a youthful squad featuring numerous highly lauded youth team prospects, including [[Cédric Mongongu]], [[Serge Gakpé]], [[Vincent Muratori]], [[Frédéric Nimani]], [[Nicolas N'Koulou]], [[Park Chu-Young]], [[Yohan Mollo]] and [[Yohann Thuram-Ulien]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/clubfootball/news/newsid=677973.html|title=The little princes of Monaco|publisher=[[FIFA]].com|date=29 January 2009}}</ref> Lacombe led Monaco to eighth place in Ligue 1 in his first season in charge, but he was unable to replicate this performance in his second season, and was sacked in January 2011, with Monaco in 17th place in Ligue 1. He was replaced by former coach [[Laurent Banide]], who was unable to turn around the club's fortunes; Monaco finished the [[2010–11 Ligue 1|2010–11 season]] in 18th, thus becoming relegated to [[Ligue 2]].

In December 2011, 66.67% of the club was sold to the Russian billionaire [[Dmitry Rybolovlev]] while the club were bottom of Ligue 2.<ref name=BBC/> Banide was sacked due to this poor start to the [[2011–12 Ligue 2|2011–12 season]], and was replaced by Italian manager [[Marco Simone]]. Although he lifted the club to eighth by the end of the season, the club's board targeted promotion for the upcoming season and so fired him and appointed his compatriot [[Claudio Ranieri]], whose attacking style of football saw the club score 64 goals in the [[2012–13 Ligue 2|2012–13 season]]. With the club only losing four times, Monaco finished the season as champions, earning promotion back to [[Ligue 1]]. Using Rybolovlev's funds, Monaco were one of the biggest spenders in Europe in 2013, spending roughly £140 million, including a club-record £50 million for [[Radamel Falcao]] from [[Atlético Madrid]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Radamel Falcao: Monaco sign striker from Atletico Madrid|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22737856|accessdate=2 April 2014|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|date=31 May 2013}}</ref>

== Stadium ==
{{main|Stade Louis II}}
[[File:Stadion von Monaco Seitenansicht.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The iconic nine arches of the [[Stade Louis II]].]]
Monaco played at the original [[Stade Louis II (1939)|Stade Louis II]] since its construction in 1939. In 1985, the stadium was replaced with the current [[Stade Louis II|iteration]], built on a nearby site consisting of land reclaimed from the Mediterranean, which has become a recurring feature of the stadium's seaside surroundings. The stadium is named after the former [[Prince of Monaco]] [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco|Louis II]] and houses a total of 18,500 supporters. The Stade Louis II is noted for its iconic nine arches and has hosted numerous athletic events and European Cup finals. Every August from 1998 – 2012 it hosted each instance of the annual [[UEFA Super Cup]], but from 2013 UEFA decided to rotate the event throughout various stadiums in Europe. The stadium has undergone renovations numerous times and, at the beginning of the [[2008–09 Ligue 1|2008–09 season]], underwent numerous changes, one of which was the installation of two large screens. Monaco train in nearby [[La Turbie]], a newly built training facility featuring state-of-the-art gyms, pools and conference centres.
