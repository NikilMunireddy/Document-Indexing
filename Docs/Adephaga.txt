The '''Adephaga''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀδηφάγος, ''adephagos'', "gluttonous"), with more than 40,000 recorded species in 10 families, are a suborder of highly specialized [[beetles]] and the second-largest suborder of the order [[Coleoptera]]. Members of this suborder are '''adephagans''', a term which notably include [[ground beetle]]s, [[tiger beetle]]s, [[predacious diving beetle]]s, and [[whirligig beetle]]s. The majority of the species belongs to the family of carabids, or ground beetles ([[Carabidae]]).

==Anatomy==
Adephagans have simple antennae with no [[pectination]] or clubs. The galeae of the [[Maxilla (arthropod mouthpart)|maxillae]] usually consist of two segments. Adult adephagans have visible [[notopleuron|notopleural]] sutures. The first visible [[abdomen|abdominal]] [[sternum (arthropod)|sternum]] is completely separated by the hind [[Arthropod leg|coxa]]e, which is one of the most easily recognizable traits of adephagans. Five segments are on each foot.

===Wings===
The [[transverse fold]] of the [[insect wing|hind wing]] is near the wing tip. The [[median nervure]] ends at this fold, where it is joined by a [[cross nervure]].

===Internal organs===
Adephagans have four [[malpighian tubule]]s. Unlike in other beetles, [[yolk chamber]]s alternate with [[egg chamber]]s in the [[ovarian tube]]s of adephagans. The coiled, tubular [[testes]] consist of a single follicle, and the [[ovary|ovaries]] are [[polytrophic]].

==Chemical glands==
All families of adephagan have paired [[pygidium|pygidial]] [[gland]]s located posterodorsally in the [[abdomen]], which are used for secreting chemicals. The glands consist of complex invaginations of the [[cuticle]] lined with [[Squamous epithelium|epidermal]] cells contiguous with the [[integument]]. The glands have no connection with the [[rectum]] and open on the eighth abdominal [[tergum]]. 

Secretions pass from the [[secretory lobe]]s, which are aggregations of secretory cells, through a tube to a reservoir lined with muscles. This reservoir then narrows to a tube leading to an opening valve.  The secretory lobes differ structurally from one taxon to another; it may be elongated or oval, branched basally or apically, or unbranched.

==Delivery of glandular compounds==
The secretion is realized in one of these manners:
*Oozing: if the gland is not muscle-lined, the discharge is limited in amount.
*Spraying: if the gland is muscle-lined, which is typically the case of carabids, the substances are ejected more or less forcefully.
*Crepitation is only associated with the [[Brachininae]] carabids and several related species. See [[bombardier beetle]] for a detailed description of the mechanism.

The secretions differ in the chemical constituents, according to the taxa. [[Gyrinidae|Gyrinids]], for instance, secrete [[norsesquiterpenes]] such as [[gyrinidal]], [[isogyrinidal]], [[gyrinidione]], or [[gyrinidone]]. [[Dytiscidae|Dytiscids]] discharge aromatic [[aldehyde]]s, [[ester]]s, and [[acid]]s, especially [[benzoic acid]]. [[Carabidae|Carabids]] typically produce [[carboxylic acid]]s, particularly [[formic acid]], [[methacrylic acid]], and [[tiglic acid]], but also [[aliphatic ketone]]s, [[saturated ester]]s, [[phenol]]s, aromatic aldehydes, and [[quinone]]s. Accessory glands or modified structures are present in some taxa: the [[Dytiscidae]] and [[Hygrobiidae]] also possess paired [[prothorax|prothoracic]] glands secreting [[steroid]]s; and the Gyrinidae are unique in the extended shape of the external opening of the pygidial gland.

The function of many compounds remain unknown, yet several hypotheses have been advanced:
*As [[toxin]]s or deterrent against [[predator]]s, some compounds indirectly play this role by easing the penetration of the deterrent into the predator's [[integument]].
*[[Antimicrobial]] and [[Fungicide|antifungal]] agents (especially in [[Hydradephaga]])
*A means to increase wetability of the integument (especially in Hydradephaga)
*Alarm [[pheromone]]s (especially in Gyrinidae)
*Propellant on water surfaces (especially in Gyrinidae)
*Conditioning plant tissues associated with [[oviposition]]

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Habitat (ecology)|Habitat]]s range from caves to [[rainforest]] [[Canopy (forest)|canopy]] and [[alpine climate|alpine]] habitats. The body forms of some are structurally modified for adaptation to habitats: members of the family Gyrinidae live at the air-water interface, [[Rhysodinae|rhysodines]] live in [[heartwood]], and [[Paussinae|paussine]] carabids inhabit [[ant nest]]s.

==Feeding==
Most species are [[predator]]s. Other less-typical forms of feeding include: [[algophagy]] (family [[Haliplidae]]), seed-feeding ([[Harpalinae|arpaline]] carabids), [[mycophagy]] (rhysodine carabids), and [[snail]]-feeding ([[Licininae|licinine]] and [[Cychrinae|cychrine]] carabids). Some species are [[ectoparasitoid]]s of insects ([[Brachininae|brachinine]] and [[Lebiinae|lebiine]] carabids) or of [[millipede]]s ([[Peleciinae|peleciine]] carabids).

==Reproduction and larval stage==
Some species are [[ovoviviparous]], such as [[Pseudomorphinae|pseudomorphine]] carabids.

The [[larva]]e are active, with well-[[chitin]]ized cuticle, often with elongated [[cercus|cerci]] and five-segmented legs, the foot-segment carrying two claws.  Larvae have a fused [[Insect mouthparts|labrum]] and no [[mandibular mola]]e.

==Phylogeny==
Adephagans diverged from their sister group in the late [[Permian]], the most recent common ancestor of living adephagans probably existing in the early [[Triassic]], around 240 million years ago. Both aquatic and terrestrial representatives of the suborder appear in fossil records of the late Triassic. The Jurassic fauna consisted of [[trachypachid]]s, carabids, gyrinids, and [[haliplid]]-like forms. The familial and tribal diversification of the group spans the [[Mesozoic]], with a few tribes radiating explosively during the [[Tertiary]]. 

The [[phylogeny]] of adephagans is disputed. The group is usually divided into two main groups:
*The [[Geadephaga]] comprise the two terrestrial families Carabidae and Trachypachidae (the Trachypachidae are sometimes considered a subfamily of the Carabidae).
*The [[Hydradephaga]], gathering all other families, are aquatic.

This division is often criticized, as mounting evidence is pointing out that the two groups are not [[monophyletic]].
