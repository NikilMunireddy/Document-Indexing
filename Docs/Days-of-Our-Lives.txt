In the 1990s, the show branched out into supernatural story lines, which critics immediately panned, as it was seen as a departure from more realistic storylines for which the show had originally become known.

== Storyline ==
[[File:Dee&Drake.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Long-time actors [[Deidre Hall]] and [[Drake Hogestyn]], who portray [[Marlena Evans]] and [[John Black (Days of our Lives)|John Black]], are known for being featured in some of the show's most famous storylines.]]
When ''Days of Our Lives'' premiered in 1965, the show revolved around the tragedies and triumphs of the suburban [[Horton family]]. Over time, additional families were brought to the show to interact with the Hortons and serve as springboards for more dramatic storylines. Originally led by patriarch [[Tom Horton|Dr. Tom Horton]] and his wife, homemaker [[Alice Horton|Alice]], the Hortons remain a prominent fixture in current continuity. One of the longest-running story lines involved the rape of [[Mickey Horton]]'s wife Laura by Mickey's brother [[Bill Horton (character)|Bill]]. Laura confides in her father-in-law Dr. Tom, and the two agree that her husband Mickey should never know. The secret, involving the true parentage of [[Mike Horton (Days of Our Lives)|Michael Horton]] (a product of the rape) and Mickey's subsequent health issues as a result of the revelation, spanned episodes from 1968 to 1975. This plotline was made even more complex with the presence of Linda Patterson (originally [[Margaret Mason]] for many years, later [[Elaine Princi]]) who claimed that her daughter Melissa had been fathered by Mickey. When Mickey married the lovely [[Maggie Simmons]] ([[Suzanne Rogers]]), Linda became even more involved in the story line as the show's main villainess, marrying the wealthy Bob Anderson ([[Mark Tapscott]]) and taking over the running of Anderson Manufacturing when he became ill. The story line involving Mickey, Laura and Bill was the first to bring the show to prominence, and put it near the top of the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] daytime ratings.<ref name="soapnet">{{cite web|title = Unforgettable Stories |last = Bonderoff |first = Jason |url = http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070319004927/http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html |archivedate = 2007-03-19 |publisher = [[SOAPnet]] |accessdate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> Another love triangle, between lounge singer [[Doug Williams and Julie Olson|Doug Williams]], Tom and Alice's daughter [[Addie Horton|Addie]], and Addie's own daughter, [[Julie Olson|Julie]], proved to be very popular around the same time. The storyline culminated in the death of Addie in 1974 and the marriage of Doug and Julie in 1976.<ref>Gilbert, Annie, ''All My Afternoons'', p. 112.</ref>

In the early 1980s, the [[Brady family (Days of our Lives)|Brady]] and [[DiMera family (Days of our Lives)|DiMera]] families were introduced, and their rivalry quickly cemented their places as core families in Salem beside the Hortons. Around the same time, with the help of head writers [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], action/adventure story lines and [[supercouple]]s such as [[Bo and Hope]], [[Shane and Kimberly]], and [[Patch and Kayla]] reinvigorated the show, previously focused primarily on the domestic troubles of the Hortons. Since the 1990s, with the introduction of writer [[James E. Reilly]], ''Days of Our Lives'' has moved from traditional plots to some supernatural and science-fiction-themed stories, in conjunction with the rivalry of good vs. evil, in a [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfield/McCoy]] feud style the Bradys versus the DiMeras.  Under the tenure of Reilly, ratings rose to #2, and stayed there until he left in 1999 to start his own creation of ''[[Passions]]''. Despite the introduction of new head writer [[Hogan Sheffer]] in 2006, ratings failed to revive, which led the show's producers to hire a few past fan favorites to stop the ratings hemorrhage.<ref name = "ratings"/>

In addition to the love triangles of Bill/Laura/Mickey and Addie/Doug/Julie, other memorable storylines include the 1968 story of amnesiac [[Tom Horton Jr.|Tom Horton, Jr.]], who returns from [[Korean War|Korea]] believing he is someone else and then proceeds to romance his younger sister [[Marie Horton|Marie]];<ref name = "soapnet"/> the 20-year tragic love triangle when John Black steals Marlena Brady from her husband Roman;<ref name = "soapnet"/> the 1982 "Salem Strangler" (Jake Kositchek, who was nicknamed "Jake the Ripper") who stalks and murders women;<ref name = "soapnet"/> the 1984 ''[[Gone with the Wind]]'' story line in which [[Hope Williams Brady]] and [[Bo Brady]] hide out on a Southern plantation and dress up as [[Scarlett O'Hara]] and [[Rhett Butler]] (devised to keep viewers tuned in while rival network ABC's soaps were preempted due to the [[1984 Summer Olympics]]);<ref name = "soapnet"/><ref name="bope">{{cite news|title=Where's the Soaps?|last=Zoglin|first=Richard|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926796,00.html|publisher=[[TIME]]|accessdate=2007-06-09 | date=1984-08-13}}</ref> and "[[The Cruise of Deception]]" in 1990, when madman Ernesto Toscano invites all his enemies aboard a ship, the ''S.S. Loretta,'' and holds them captive.<ref name = "soapnet"/>

In 1992, the show received a reboot with additions such as refurbished sets, the debut of the Brady Pub,  the addition of new characters such as [[Vivian Alamain]], Lisanne Gardner, [[Billie Reed]], and [[Kate Roberts (Days of our Lives)|Kate Roberts]]. Later that same year, ''Days of Our Lives'' introduced its highly popular teen scene with new characters such as a [[SORAS]]ed [[Sami Brady]], played by [[Alison Sweeney]], [[Carrie Brady]], played by [[Tracy Middendorf]], and then back to [[Christie Clark]] again, [[Austin Reed (Days of our Lives)|Austin Reed]] portrayed by [[Patrick Muldoon]], [[Lucas Roberts]] played by [[Bryan Dattilo]],  Abe Carver's younger brother Jonah Carver, played by Thyme Lewis, Jamie Caldwell, played by Miriam Parish, and Wendy Reardon played by Tammy Townsend to appeal to younger viewers. However, by 1997, the characters of Jonah, Jamie, and Wendy had been written out or faded into the background, proving to be unsuccessful  and the Carrie/Austin/Sami/Mike love triangle and the [[Will Horton]] paternity issue/custody battle storyline had now been taking most of the series' air time.

The shocking and ratings-grabbing 1993 plot when [[Vivian Alamain]] buried Dr. [[Carly Manning]] alive (the first controversial storyline from head writer Reilly);<ref name="carlyburiedalive">{{cite web|title=Buried Alive Carly vs. Sheridan|url=http://daytimeconfidential.zap2it.com/forums/10/09/10/buried-alive-carly-vs-sheridan|accessdate=2011-10-27|publisher=DaytimeConfidential|date=2010-10-10}}</ref> and the 1994–1995 story line in which the town's Christmas tree burns down and [[Marlena Evans|Marlena]] becomes [[demonic possession|possessed]] in ''[[The Exorcist (film)|Exorcist]]'' fashion.<ref name="marlenadevil">{{cite news|title=Soap Operas: The Old and the Desperate|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982368-1,00.html|publisher=[[TIME]]|accessdate=2007-06-09 | date=1995-05-29|first=Ginia|last=Bellafante}}</ref><ref name = "soapnet"/>

Also from 1993 to 1998, the soap saw a lot of actress [[Eileen Davidson]]. Her character, [[Kristen DiMera]] suffers a miscarriage in secret, and in a panic to keep John Black away from Marlena, pretends to still be pregnant with John's child. Stefano hires a [[doppelganger]], [[Susan Banks]] to conceive and bear a child for her (which resulted in the birth of [[EJ DiMera]]). Eileen Davidson portrayed the entire Banks family clan, four in total (including one male), as well as her main character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soaps.sheknows.com/daysofourlives/cast/987/Susan_Banks_Crumb/ |title=Susan Banks Crumb Played by Brynn Thayer on Days of Our Lives - Soaps.com |publisher=Soaps.sheknows.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daysofourlives.com/show_guide/famous_plots_detail_576.html |title=Days of our Lives |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-07-26 |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726042645/http://www.daysofourlives.com/show_guide/famous_plots_detail_576.html |archivedate=July 26, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daysofourlives.com/show_guide/famous_plots_detail_574.html |title=Days of our Lives |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2013-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824040521/http://www.daysofourlives.com/show_guide/famous_plots_detail_574.html |archivedate=August 24, 2010 }}</ref>

2000 saw the departures of front-and-center cast members, [[Louise Sorel]] as [[Vivian Alamain]] and [[Jensen Ackles]] as [[Eric Brady]]. Ackles and the character of Eric had been one of the main focus of the series for the past three years prior, in which the void would be hard to fill. Ken Corday and NBC announced plans to re-introduced a SORAS Brady Black, immediately following the conclusion of Eric's storyline. That spring, Kyle Lowder was cast as the new Brady Black, whom would now be aged to his early 20's, first appearing on August
21, 2000, a month following Eric's exit. Lowder's Brady did prove to win over the majority of viewers, as his pairing with Chloe Lane proved highly popular. The pair married and left town in 2005 when Lowder's contract was not renewed.

2003–2004's "Melaswen", saw several characters purportedly die at the hands of a masked psychopath; they are later revealed to have been kidnapped to the secret island of Melaswen (''New Salem'' spelled backwards).<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|title = Unforgettable Stories|last = Bonderoff|first = Jason|url = http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070319004927/http://soapnet.go.com/specials/days40th/article2.html|archivedate = 2007-03-19|publisher = [[SOAPnet]]|accessdate = 2007-06-08}}</ref> 2007's "Bradys and DiMeras: The Reveal", told the story regarding how the Brady/DiMera feud started.

When ''Days of Our Lives'' debuted the cast consisted of seven main characters ([[Tom Horton]], [[Alice Horton]], [[Mickey Horton]], [[Marie Horton]], [[Julie Olson]], Tony Merritt, and Craig Merritt).<ref name="Days of Our Lives: A Complete History of the Long-Running Soap Opera">{{cite book|title=Days of Our Lives: A Complete History of the Long-Running Soap Opera|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> When the show expanded to one hour in April 1975, the cast increased to 27 actors. By the 25th anniversary in 1990, 40 actors appeared on the show in contract or recurring roles,<ref name="Days of Our Lives: A Complete History of the Long-Running Soap Opera"/> which is the approximate number of actors the show has used since then.

Original cast member [[Frances Reid]], who played [[Alice Horton]], remained on contract with ''Days of Our Lives'' until her death on February 3, 2010, though she last appeared on the show in December 2007.<ref name="creators"/> Original cast member [[John Clarke (actor)|John Clarke]], who played Mickey Horton, left the series in 2004. [[Suzanne Rogers]], who plays [[Maggie Horton]] has been on the show since 1973, and [[Susan Seaforth Hayes]] has played [[Julie Olson Williams]] since 1968 with a few breaks in between, and also her husband [[Bill Hayes (actor)|Bill Hayes]], who has played [[Doug Williams (Days of our Lives)|Doug Williams]] since 1970, though neither Seaforth Hayes or Hayes is employed with the serial on contract.

In recent years, ''Days of Our Lives'' has hired back many former cast members. Twenty of the current contract cast members have been with the show, off-and-on, since at least 1999. Since 2005, cast members from the 1980s and 1990s, such as [[Christie Clark]] ([[Carrie Brady]]), [[Stephen Nichols]] ([[Steve Johnson (Days)|Steve Johnson]]), [[Austin Peck]] ([[Austin Reed (Days of our Lives)|Austin Reed]]), [[Mary Beth Evans]] ([[Kayla Brady]]), [[Joseph Mascolo]] ([[Stefano DiMera]]), and [[Thaao Penghlis]] ([[Tony DiMera]]) have been brought back to ''Days of Our Lives''.<ref name="ratings">{{cite web|title=Mascolo Brings Stefano Back to Salem|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/days/news/2007/0507-mascolo.php|publisher=Soap Central|accessdate=2007-06-09}}</ref> More additions to the show include the returns of  [[Crystal Chappell]] ([[Carly Manning|Dr. Carly Manning]]), and [[Louise Sorel]] ([[Vivian Alamain]]).

== Executive producing and head writing team ==
{{Main|Days of Our Lives producers and writers}}

The co-creator and original executive producer, [[Ted Corday]], was only at the helm for eight months before dying of cancer in 1966. His widow, [[Betty Corday|Betty]], was named executive producer upon his death. She continued in that role, with the help of [[H. Wesley Kenney]] and [[Al Rabin]] as supervising producers, before she semi-retired in 1985. When Mrs. Corday semi-retired in 1985, and later died in 1987, her son, Ken, became executive producer and took over the full-time, day-to-day running of the show,<ref name="Soap Opera Digest' 1998, page 42"/>  a title he still holds today. The series' current co-executive producers are Greg Meng and [[Lisa de Cazotte]]. In March 2015, it was reported that de Cazotte would no longer serve as a co-executive producer for the series. [[Albert Alarr]] was announced as de Cazotte's replacement as a co-executive producer.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Errol|title=‘DAYS" Lisa de Cazotte OUT!

The first long-term head writer, [[William J. Bell]], started writing for ''Days of Our Lives'' in 1966 and continued until 1975, a few years after he had created his own successful soap, ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''. He stayed with the show as a story line consultant until 1978. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, many writing changes occurred. In the early 1980s, [[Margaret DePriest]] helped stabilize the show with her serial killer story line. Later head writers, such as [[Sheri Anderson]], [[Thom Racina]], and [[Leah Laiman]], built on that stability and crafted story lines of their own, temporarily bringing up ratings. Many writing changes occurred after Laiman left the series in 1989 and would not become stable again until [[James E. Reilly]] started with the show in 1993. His tenure, which lasted for four-and-a-half years, was credited with bringing ratings up to the second place spot in the Nielsens. Other writers who succeeded him, such as [[Sally Sussman Morina]] and [[Tom Langan]], failed to keep the ratings success, and another writer turnover continued until Reilly returned to the series in 2003.

Five-time Daytime Emmy winner [[Hogan Sheffer]] was named head writer with great fanfare in October 2006, but lasted less than 16 months with the show, with his last episode airing in January 2008. Former head writer [[Dena Higley]]'s first episode aired on April 23, 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20186226,00.html|title=The Powers that be| accessdate=2008-04-01|publisher=EW.com|date=2008-03-26}}</ref> Her co-head writer was [[Christopher Whitesell]] until February 2011. On May 18, 2011, Dena Higley was fired. The new head writers were Marlene McPherson and Darrell Ray Thomas Jr.

In April 2012, it was confirmed that McPherson and Thomas Jr. were fired from their positions as co-head writers. [[Gary Tomlin]] and Christopher Whitesell were hired for the position.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soapoperadigest.com/content/days-writers-out |title=DAYS Writers OUT |publisher=''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'' |accessdate=April 4, 2012 |date=2012-04-04}}</ref> It was later confirmed that former ''[[All My Children]]'' headwriter [[Lorraine Broderick]] would join Tomlin and Whitesell as a breakdown writer on the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://soapoperadigest.com/content/its-official-days-names-new-writing-team |title=It's Official: DAYS Names New Writing Team |publisher=''Soap Opera Digest'' |accessdate=April 6, 2012 |date=2012-04-06}}</ref> In February 2015, ''Soap Opera Digest'' confirmed that both Tomlin and Whitesell had been ousted in their roles as head-writers; they further confirmed that former head writer Higley would return, alongside former ''The Young and the Restless'' head writer [[Josh Griffith]].

In August 2015, reports stated that Higley would be taking a leave of absence from the show. In her place, Sony would be sending a writer from ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' to help Griffith with the transition. The writer was later revealed to be former head writer [[Beth Milstein]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Giddens|first1=Jamey|title=REPORT: Dena Higley Takes Leave of Absence From Days of Our Lives|url=http://daytimeconfidential.com/2015/08/12/report-dena-higley-takes-leave-of-absence-from-days-of-our-lives|website={{noitalic|Daytime Confidential}}|publisher=Confidential Media, Inc.

In February 2016, several days after the show was renewed for another year, ''Soap Opera Digest'' exclusively reported that Griffith has departed the show as head writer with Higley remaining; they further revealed that script writer Ryan Quan has been promoted to replace Griffith.<ref>{{cite news|author1=SOD|title=EXCLUSIVE!

== Domestic broadcast ==
According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', ''Days of Our Lives'' is the most widely distributed soap opera in the United States, with episodes not just broadcast via NBC, but also via cable ([[SOAPnet]]), and as of June 2007, episodes are offered via [[iTunes Store|iTunes]].<ref name="Josef Adalian"/>

For the first three years on the air, ''Days of Our Lives'' was near the bottom of the Nielsen ratings, and close to cancellation. However, its ascent to the top was rapid; as the 1969 TV season ended, it became an effective tool of NBC, which attempted to dethrone daytime leader [[CBS]]. By 1973 the show, pitted against CBS' popular ''[[Guiding Light]]'' and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The Newlywed Game]]'' at 2 p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|ET]])/1 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|CT]]),<ref name="daytime">{{cite web|title=NBC Daytime|last=Alliaume|first=Curt|url=http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> had matched the first-place ratings of ''As the World Turns'' and sister NBC soap ''Another World''. Due to the success of the program, it expanded from a half-hour to one hour on April 21, 1975. This expansion had followed the lead of ''Another World,'' which became TV's first-ever hour-long soap on January 6, three-and-a-half months earlier. Further, ''Days of Our Lives''' new starting time of 1:30 p.m./12:30<ref name = "daytime"/> finally solved a scheduling problem that began in 1968 when NBC lost the game ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'' to ABC, and in its wake, eight different shows were placed into the slot (''[[Hidden Faces]]'', ''[[You're Putting Me On]]'', ''[[House Party (radio and TV show)#Television|Life with Linkletter]]'', ''Words & Music'', ''[[Memory Game]]'', ''[[Three on a Match (game show)|Three on a Match]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', and ''[[How to Survive a Marriage]]'').

However, this first golden period for NBC daytime proved to be short-lived, as ''Days of Our Lives''' ratings began to decline in 1977. Much of the decline was due to ABC's expansion of its increasingly popular soap ''[[All My Children]]'' to a full hour, the last half of which overlapped with the first half of ''Days of Our Lives'' By January 1979, the network, in a mode of desperation more than anything else, decided to jump headlong against ''AMC'' and moved the show ahead to the same 1:00&nbsp;p.m./12 Noon time slot.<ref name = "daytime"/> In exchange to its affiliates for taking away the old half-hour access slot at 1:00/Noon, NBC gave them the 4 p.m./3 slot, which many (if not most) stations had been preempting for years anyway.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|title=NBC Daytime|last=Alliaume|first=Curt|url=http://www.curtalliaume.com/nbc_day.html|publisher="Curt Alliaume's Utterly Irrelevant Web Site"|accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref> By 1986, ABC and CBS followed suit, under the intense pressure of lucrative (and cheap) [[television syndication|syndicated]] programming offered to affiliates.

By 1980, ''Days of Our Lives'' had displaced ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' as NBC's highest-rated soap. However, the entire NBC soap lineup was in ratings trouble. In fact, by 1982, all of its shows were rated above only one ABC soap (''[[The Edge of Night]]'') and below all four CBS soaps. The "supercouple" era of the 1980s, however, helped bring about a ratings revival, and the 1983–1984 season saw ''Days of Our Lives'' experience a surge in ratings. It held onto its strong numbers for most of the 1980s, only to decline again by 1990, eventually falling back into eighth place. In the mid-1990s, however, the show experienced a resurgence in popularity and the show reached number two in the ratings, where it remained for several years before experiencing another ratings decline beginning in 1999, the year that ''Days of Our Lives'' became NBC's longest-running daytime program (upon the cancellation of ''Another World''). Throughout the 2000s (decade), ''Days of Our Lives'' and all the other remaining network daytime serials have witnessed a steady erosion of viewers, mainly due to vastly altered viewing habits induced by [[cable television|cable]] networks and alternative genres such as [[reality shows|reality]] and [[talk shows]] on minor network affiliates.

On January 17, 2007, NBC Universal Television president [[Jeff Zucker]] remarked that ''Days of Our Lives'' would most likely not "continue past 2009."<ref name="zucker">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC|last=Levin|first=Gary|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-17-nbc-presstour_x.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2007-06-08 | date=2007-01-17}}</ref> This contributed to an immediate ratings decline for ''Days of Our Lives''. The show was averaging a 2.4 rating prior to the announcement, dropped to a 2.2 average household rating in the months after. In an April 2007 interview with ''[[Soap Opera Digest]]'', executive producer Ken Corday commented on the ratings decline of the previous months, "If I don't pay attention to the ratings and what the viewers are saying, I'm an ostrich. I have not seen a decline in the ratings on the show this precipitous — ever. I've never seen this much of a percentage decline."<ref name=autogenerated3>''Soap Opera Digest''. "Crisis at ''DAYS''! The Secret Plan to Save It". April 17, 2007.</ref>

''Days of Our Lives'' had finished the 2008-2009 television season with substantial increases in viewers (3.0 million vs. 2.8 million) and has risen to the #3 spot behind ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', respectively.  It was the #2 daytime program behind ''The Young and the Restless'' in the much coveted 18-49 demographic.  During the first few months of the 2009-2010 season, ''Days of Our Lives'' increased its average household rating to 2.4, and averaged consistently over 3,000,000 viewers. It was only one point behind the #2 daytime drama ''The Bold and the Beautiful'', and has beat that soap on several days during the season. In 2010, ''Days of Our Lives'' continued to increase viewership, reaching as high as 3.6 million viewers on several days. A substantial increase in viewership such as ''Days of Our Lives'' has had lately also bucks the viewership trend in daytime dramas, which had declined since the 1990s for all other daytime drama series. ''Days of Our Lives'' was the only daytime drama series to increase in viewers between 2008 and 2010 and had reduced its operating budget, making it a profitable asset to NBC's broadcast line-up.<ref name="Days of our Lives Renewed">{{cite news|title=No surprises at NBC - Days of our Lives Renewed|url=http://www.nbc.com/days-of-our-lives/news/|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=2007-06-08 | date=2007-01-17}}</ref>

However starting in 2011, ''Days of Our Lives'' started to lose ground significantly to the point that it sometimes occupied the last position among all soaps for both total viewership and the 18-49 women demographic. The ending of ''[[All My Children]]'' on ABC combined with the return of several cast members allowed a brief resurgence of ''Days of Our Lives'' in October 2011, but ratings soon declined again. In December 2011, ''Days of Our Lives'' recorded three consecutive weeks of new lows in the 18-49 women key demo category.,<ref name="New lows 1">{{cite web|last=Toups |first=Xavier |url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/ratings/ratings-new-lows-for-days-yr-in-women-18-49-viewers |title=Ratings: New Lows For DAYS & Y&R in Women 18-49 Viewers |publisher=Soap Opera Network |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref><ref name="New lows 2">{{cite web|last=Toups |first=Xavier |url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/ratings/ratings-another-new-low-for-days-in-women-18-49-viewers |title=Ratings: Another New Low For DAYS in Women 18-49 Viewers |publisher=Soap Opera Network |date=2011-12-23 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref><ref name="New lows 3">{{cite web|last=Toups |first=Xavier |url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/ratings/ratings-days-hits-lows-for-third-straight-week |title=Ratings: DAYS Hits Lows For Third Straight Week |publisher=Soap Opera Network |date=2012-01-03 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref><ref name="New lows 4">{{cite web|last=Toups |first=Xavier |url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/news/ratings-days-hits-new-low-in-women-18-49-viewers-2 |title=Ratings: DAYS Hits New Low in Women 18-49 Viewers |publisher=Soap Opera Network |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref> and again another consecutive three weeks of low ratings in the same demographic during March–April 2012 <ref>{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=Errol |url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/news/the-revolution-hits-new-series-low-bringing-down-general-hospital |title=‘The Revolution’ Hits New Series Low, Bringing Down ‘General Hospital’ |publisher=Soap Opera Network |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Toups |first=Xavier |url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/news/ratings-another-new-low-for-days-in-women-18-49-viewers-2 |title=Ratings: Another New Low For DAYS in Women 18-49 Viewers |publisher=Soap Opera Network |date=2012-04-06 |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref><ref>|url=http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/news/ratings-new-lows-for-days-another-horrible-week-for-soaps |date=20131113114601 [http://www.soapoperanetwork.com/news/ratings-new-lows-for-days-another-horrible-week-for-soaps Ratings: New Lows For DAYS/Y&R; Another Horrible Week For Soaps | Soap Opera Network<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{wayback}}</ref>

=== Local scheduling variations ===
Since January 1993 after the cancellation of ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', [[WPXI-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]] airs ''Days'' weekdays during its 3:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot while some stations such as [[WJAC-TV]] in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]] air the program during the 2:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot, but most stations continue to air ''Days'' at its 1 p.m. time slot.

However, the program has received schedule and station shifts with the start of the [[2013–14 United States network television schedule (weekday)|2013-14 television season]]. One NBC station, [[KSNV-DT]] in [[Las Vegas]], stopped carrying the show on August 19, 2013 due to a long-term move to an all-news schedule outside of network news and primetime programming; the program moved to the market's [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[KVCW]], where it aired at its traditional 1:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot until an ownership change saw the show return to KSNV in late December 2014 as part of a change in the all-news plans. With the cancellation of ''[[Passions]]'', ''Days'' is now NBC's last remaining daytime soap opera, as well as the network's last remaining daytime program.<ref>{{cite web|title = Days of Our Lives Weekly Nielsen Ratings Charts|url = http://members.aol.com/jason47b/pressrelease.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080110144119/http://members.aol.com/jason47b/pressrelease.html|archivedate = 2008-01-10|accessdate = 2007-06-10}}</ref> [[Salt Lake City]]'s [[KSL-TV]] moved the show to the late night 1:05&nbsp;a.m. slot three weeks later on September 9 for unknown reasons, though a romantic plot line between two gay characters was theorized as a reason for the move; the station is owned by the [[Bonneville International|broadcasting arm]] of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church]].<ref name=slt-ksl-gay-daytime-channel>{{cite web|title=KSL won’t be airing ‘Days of Our Lives’ during day |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56819585-223/ksl-gay-daytime-channel.html.csp |work=The Salt Lake Tribune |accessdate=6 September 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002034629/http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment2/56819585-223/ksl-gay-daytime-channel.html.csp |archivedate=October 2, 2013 }}</ref>

Throughout Canada, ''Days of Our Lives'' currently airs at 1:00 pm on [[Global Television Network]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globaltv.com/daysofourlives/ |title=Days of our Lives - GlobalTV.com: Global Television Official Site |publisher=GlobalTV.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-07}}</ref> Episodes are aired in sync with the NBC broadcast to take advantage of [[simultaneous substitution]] regulations.

[[New Zealand]] has aired ''Days of Our Lives'' along with ''The Young and the Restless'' since 1975, debuting on [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ). Originally airing weekdays on [[TV2 (New Zealand)|TV2]] was shifted to [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]] in 2003, where it was put in a 2pm time slot. The soap was approximately five seasons behind the NBC season due to being preempted by holiday and sporting programming. During October 2009, TVNZ announced that they were ending their exclusive contract with Sony Pictures. Despite a national petition from fans ''Days of Our Lives'' ended on May 19, 2010. On February 27, 2013, nearly three years the series' final broadcast on TVNZ, [[ChoiceTV]] announced their decision to pick up the series; the series began broadcasting on March 11, 2013, weekdays at 1:30pm. Broadcasting began with the series' 46th season (2011–12), meaning the show would be only 18 months behind the current NBC season in the US.

[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] aired episodes of ''Days  of our Lives'' in the United Kingdom from March 2000 to April 2001, eventually pulling it off the air; network executives deemed its audience of 200,000 viewers as too low a figure.<ref name=daysuk/> ''Days'' had previously aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on the [[Sky Soap]] channel between 1994 and 1999; episodes were three years behind U.S. telecasts.

From the show's debut in 1965 until March 1966, announcer Ed Prentiss spoke the phrase, adding ''"Days of Our Lives,'' a new dramatic serial starring Macdonald Carey."<ref name = "credits"/> Since April 1966, the voice has been that of [[Macdonald Carey]], who played [[Tom Horton|Dr. Thomas Horton]] from the show's premiere until the actor's 1994 death from [[lung cancer]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,980442,00.html|title=Milestones: MacDonald Carey obituary|date=1994-04-04|accessdate=2007-06-08|publisher=''[[TIME]]'' magazine}}</ref> From 1966 to 1994, he would add "This is Macdonald Carey, and these are the ''Days of Our Lives."''

The theme that regularly accompanies each sequence was composed by Charles Albertine, [[Tommy Boyce]], and [[Boyce and Hart|Bobby Hart]].<ref name="song">{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/bobby-hart/biography/ |title=Bobby Hart Biography |accessdate=2007-06-10 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] Music |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120708013014/http://music.yahoo.com/bobby-hart/biography/ |archivedate=July 8, 2012 }}</ref> The theme has only been modified a few times since ''Days of Our Lives'' premiered: in 1972; in 1993, when the opening titles were changed to computerized visuals (designed by [[Wayne Fitzgerald]] and Judy Loren); in 2004, with an orchestral arrangement that was only used in eight episodes, after which time the theme was reverted to the 1993 arrangement; and in 2009, when the theme was edited for time and shortened. Beginning with the November 8, 2010 episode, there were slight changes to the coloring of the sky background in the sequence now being displayed in [[16:9]] widescreen. However, there was very little change in the sequence's appearance from the 1993 version.

== Parodies ==
* [[Second City Television|SCTV]] had a recurring soap opera sketch called "Days of the Week" which featured [[Martin Short]] and [[Andrea Martin]].

* ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'': Just after Emily goes to walk after her and Richard's fight, Lorelai says ''Like sands through the hourglass, so are the Gilmores of Our Lives''. This happened at season 2 in episode 10 ("The Bracebridge Dinner").

== Fans ==
The show has had many high-profile fans. In 1976, ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine reported that then-Justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], would call a recess around the 1 p.m. hour to watch ''Days of Our Lives''.<ref name="Marshall">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ckOav3Szu7oC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=true|page=13|title=A History and Ethnography of the Beothuk|first=Ingeborg |last=Marshall |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-7735-1774-X}}</ref> Actress [[Julia Roberts]] admitted at the 2002 [[People's Choice Awards]] that she was a fan of ''Days of Our Lives'', asked to be seated near the cast, and upon winning her award stated, "I'm very nervous because the cast of ''Days of Our Lives'' is here."
