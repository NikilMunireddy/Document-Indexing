==History==
{{main|History of D.C. United}}
Prior to the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]], the [[United States Soccer Federation]] fulfilled its promise to [[FIFA]] by aiding in the foundation of a new professional league. On June 15, 1994, [[Major League Soccer]] selected Washington, D.C. out of twenty-two applicants to host one of the first seven teams, with three more added before the league's launch.<ref name=overview>{{cite web |url= http://web.mlsnet.com/about/ |title= General Overview |work= [[Major League Soccer]] |year= 2009 |accessdate=June 26, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625214719/http://web.mlsnet.com/about/ |archivedate = June 25, 2008|deadurl=yes}}</ref> Like many team names in MLS, the team's name was chosen as a reflection of the names of European clubs, such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] or [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]].

[[Image:DC United post-game victory celebration (RFK Memorial Stadium, 06-11-2004).jpg|left|thumb|D.C. United won the 2004 Eastern Conference championship in what has been called one of the best games in MLS history.|alt=A team celebrates in the center of a soccer field while fans in stand on both sides cheer.]]
On April 6, 1996, D.C. United played in the league's inaugural match against the [[San Jose Clash]] in [[Spartan Stadium (San Jose)|Spartan Stadium]] in [[San Jose, California]].<ref name=overview/> In the league's early years, D.C. was the most successful of all the teams in MLS. In their first year, coach [[Bruce Arena]] led the team to the first "double" in modern U.S. soccer history by beating the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] in the first [[MLS Cup]] and the [[Rochester Raging Rhinos]] of the [[USL First Division]] in the 1996 [[U.S. Open Cup]]. D.C. repeated its MLS Cup victory in 1997 against the [[Colorado Rapids]], in front of a home crowd at RFK Stadium. The team also experienced early success in [[CONCACAF]] competitions, winning both the [[CONCACAF Champions' Cup|Champions' Cup]] and the [[Interamerican Cup]] in 1998.<ref name=trophies/>

In October 1998, Arena left the team to coach [[United States men's national soccer team|the U.S. men's national team]]. Arena's departure marked the beginning of a downturn in the team's fortunes.<ref name=FIFA>{{cite web |url= http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/news/newsid=887744.html |title= America's one and only United |work= [[FIFA]] |date= September 24, 2008 |accessdate=September 6, 2009}}</ref> While the club again won the MLS Cup in 1999 under coach [[Thomas Rongen]], lackluster results in 2000 and 2001 led to Rongen's departure and his replacement by [[Ray Hudson]] in 2002. The team did not, however, fare much better under Hudson, and [[Piotr Nowak]] replaced him before the start of the 2004 season.<ref name=tradition>{{cite web|url=http://web.mlsnet.com/t103/load.jsp?section=about&content=tradition |title=D.C.

On November 18, 2003, [[Major League Soccer|MLS]] made sports history by signing [[Freddy Adu]], a 14-year-old soccer prodigy and on January 16, 2004 he was officially selected by United with the first pick in the [[2004 MLS SuperDraft]]. When Adu entered United's regular-season opener as a second-half substitute on April 3, 2004, he became the youngest player in any professional sport in the United States since 1887.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6169400.stm |title= Doubts raised in US over Adu move |first= Matt |last= Slater |work=BBC News |date= November 22, 2006 |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref> On December 11, 2006, D.C.

In 2005, the club again made MLS history by becoming the first United States-based team to participate in [[Copa Sudamericana]], entering in the Round of sixteen.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/22/AR2005092202000_pf.html |title= United Ousted From Copa Sudamericana |date= September 23, 2005 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref> Since 2006, United has played well against international competition, beating [[Scottish Premier League|Scottish]] champions [[Celtic F.C.]] and drawing [[Real Madrid]] in [[Seattle]].

Since winning back-to-back Shields in 2006 and 2007, the club [[List of MLS club post-season droughts#Post-season appearance droughts|failed to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs]] five years in a row. During this stretch, United's lone major title came in 2008, when they won the [[2008 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]]. In league play during the 2008 and 2009 campaigns, United faltered at the tail-end of each season, ultimately causing them to miss out on the playoffs. They had a poor [[2010 MLS season]], winning only six matches, drawing four and losing 20. In 2011, United again failed to qualify for the playoffs in the second to last week of the campaign.

==Colors and badge==
[[File:DCUnitedOld.png|thumb|Original logo of D.C. United.|alt=A shield with stylized black eagle facing right on a red field under the words "D.C. United". Below the eagle are three white stars with soccer balls.]]

The team's colors and original logo were announced on October 17, 1995 along with those of the other ten original teams during a presentation in New York City.<ref name=overview/> Black and white are D.C. United's primary colors, though the team's nickname is the "Black-and-Red." Red is used to accent the home jersey while white is the main color of the team's away kit. The three stripes along the shoulder – in white at home and black on the road – do not represent the three jurisdictions of the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]] (Washington, D.C., [[Maryland]], and [[Virginia]]); rather, they represent the fact that the team's kits are made by [[Adidas]]. United's shirt sponsor is [[Reston, Virginia]] defense company [[Leidos]].<ref>http://www.dcunited.com/news/2014/02/leidos-becomes-official-sponsor-of-dc-united</ref> In 2011, the team introduced a predominantly red [[Third jersey|third kit]] with black accents to be worn four or more times in the season.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/2011/01/dc_uniteds_third_jersey.html |title= D.C. United introduces a third jersey |first= Steve |last= Goff |work=The Washington Post |date= January 29, 2011 |accessdate=February 8, 2011}}</ref> The team has also previously used white away uniforms with red stripes; white and red are the colors of the [[flag of Washington, D.C.]], and the stripes are also reminiscent of those used on the flag.

The team's original shield was implemented in 1996 consisting of the team's name, D.C. United, above a black [[bald eagle]] facing right on a red field, clawing three [[soccer ball]]s overlaid on three white stars. The three stars and balls were intended to represent the region's three jurisdictions. The bird, associated with the federal government based in Washington, D.C., symbolizes many of the attributes of the team, including speed and power. The logo was redesigned before the 1998 season. The current design reoriented the eagle facing left, and removed the three stars below it, whose metaphor was retained by three raised wing feathers. At the center of the eagle is a single gold-colored star and soccer ball, which represents the team's victory in [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[MLS Cup 1996|inaugural cup in 1996]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.footballcrests.com/clubs/dc-united-sc |title= D.C. United S.C. |work= FootballCrests.com |first= Doug |last= Hicks |accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> The logo can also be adorned with four silver [[Star (football badge)|stars]] above it, representing the [[MLS Cup]]s the team has won.

On December 10, 2015, D.C. United unveiled an updated logo designed by Peter Horridge, featuring a [[Flag of the District of Columbia|D.C. flag]]-inspired design across the eagle, an updated wordmark, and more dynamic wings.<ref>{{cite web|author=MLSsoccer staff|title=DC United unveil updated team logo for only the second time in club history|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2015/12/10/dc-united-unveil-updated-team-logo-only-second-time-club-history|publisher=Major League Soccer|date=December 10, 2015|accessdate=December 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soccer-insider/wp/2015/12/10/d-c-united-unveils-a-new-logo/ |title= D.C.

[[File:RFK Stadium from Washington Metro train.jpg|thumb|[[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] has been home to D.C. United for the team's entire existence.|alt= A large circular stadium with a curving overhang behind a mostly unused parking lot.]]

[[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] (RFK) has been home to D.C. United since the club's founding in 1996. The D.C. United Training Complex is located north of the stadium, and is where the [[MLS Reserve Division|Reserve Division]] team plays.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://dcunited.mlsnet.com/t103/camps/academy/directions/ |title= D.C.

RFK was built in 1961 as a dual use baseball and [[American football]] stadium. Prior to 1996, it periodically hosted soccer matches, including the 1980 [[Soccer Bowl]], the 1993 [[Supercoppa Italiana]], and five matches during the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. When the [[Washington Nationals]] baseball team shared the field from 2005 to 2007, there were criticisms regarding problems with the playing surface and even the dimensions of the field.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16346-2005Apr26.html |first= Steven |last= Goff |work=The Washington Post |date= April 26, 2005 |accessdate=May 27, 2009 | title=MLS Officials: United Played on Irregular Field}}</ref>

===New DC United Stadium===
{{Main|D.C. United Stadium}}
In July 2006, D.C. United proposed building a new stadium along the [[Anacostia River]] near [[Anacostia Park]], but disputes with the city government forced the team to consider other sites.<ref name=kravitz/><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/20/AR2007072002470_pf.html |title= Talks Fall Apart on Stadium for D.C.

This proposal ran into similar trouble, however, when the County Council voted to send a letter to the [[Maryland General Assembly]] opposing the stadium plan.<ref>{{cite news |title=Prince George's vote likely kills D.C.

In October 2009, the [[Baltimore Sun]] reported that [[Baltimore]] mayor [[Sheila Dixon]] has asked the [[Maryland Stadium Authority]] to explore the possibility of wooing D.C. United to Baltimore by building a soccer stadium that could serve as D.C. United's permanent home, as well as host other events.  The Baltimore plan did not coalesce, however, and the team returned its focus to Washington D.C.

On July 25, 2013, a tentative deal was announced which will see a 20,000-25,000 seat stadium built at [[Buzzard Point]] costing $300 million.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.stadiadirectory.com/deal-reached-for-new-d-c-united-stadium/|title= Deal reached for new stadium |work=StadiaDirectory |date= July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Term  Sheet DC United Stadium Project |work= District of Columbia and DC Soccer LLC |date= July 25, 2013 |publisher= District of Columbia Office of the City Administrator |url= http://oca.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/oca/page_content/attachments/Soccer%20Stadium%20Term%20Sheet%20%28executed%20copy%29.pdf }}</ref> Following votes by the D.C.

The agreement also contained a clause governing land: If the cost of land acquisition rose above $150 million, D.C. United was required to reimburse the city 50 percent of the excess (although the club's commitment was capped at $10 million). The club was also barred from playing more than an occasional home game away from the Buzzard Point stadium (e.g., barred from relocating for the term of the lease).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/united-district-reach-final-terms-on-stadium-deal/2015/06/08/9f991a0e-06db-4a9a-9372-8c103b8a31ce_story.html|last=O'Connell|first=Jonathan|title=United, District reach final terms on stadium deal|work=The Washington Post|date=June 9, 2015|accessdate=July 1, 2015|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|url=http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/06/08/dc-united-finalizes-deal-new-stadium-buzzard-point|last=Straus|first=Brian|title=D.C.

=== Rivalries ===
D.C. United's primary rival is the [[New York Red Bulls]]. The two teams compete annually for the [[Atlantic Cup (Major League Soccer)|Atlantic Cup]], a competition instituted by the two clubs. The cup is awarded to the team that gets the most points across the teams' meetings throughout the season. D.C. United also has a burgeoning rivalry with the [[Philadelphia Union]] as the two teams represent two cities separated by only 120 miles.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/sports/2011/09/30/union-and-united-building-animosity/|title=Union and United: Building animosity|last=FoxSports|date=October 1, 2011|work=Latino.foxnews.com|publisher=Fox News Latino|accessdate=October 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.necn.com/08/20/12/The-Inside-Doop-Union-DC-United-rivalry/landing_styleboston.html?blockID=760039&tagID=14877 |title=The Inside Doop: Union-D.C.

== Ownership ==
{{main|D.C. United Holdings}}

When the league was founded in 1995, billionaire investor [[George Soros]] was the primary financial backer and director of Washington Soccer L.P., the group that owned the operating rights to D.C. United.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/62439758.html?dids=62439758:62439758&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&fmac=&date=Oct+12%2C+2000&author=Steven+Goff&desc=United%27s+Ownership+Uncertain%3B+After+Sale+Fell+Through%2C+MLS+Might+Take+Over+Operation |title= United's Ownership Uncertain; After Sale Fell Through, MLS Might Take Over Operation |work=The Washington Post |first= Steven |last= Goff |date= October 12, 2000 |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}</ref> [[Kevin Payne (soccer)|Kevin Payne]], former President of Soccer USA Partners and current CEO of D.C.

By 1998 the group was looking for new investors, and on February 15, 2001, it agreed to sell the team to [[Anschutz Entertainment Group]] (AEG), founded by Colorado billionaire [[Philip Anschutz]], with AEG exercising its option to become the sole investor-operator on January 8, 2002.<ref name=overview/> AEG, who also own [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] and [[Houston Dynamo]], ran the team until 2007.

In May 2007, United entered into an initial one-year strategic partnership with Brazilian club [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]]. The goal of the partnership is to enhance the sporting and commercial success of the respective clubs by sharing expertise and experience as well as creating new opportunities for the clubs in both areas.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://dcunited.mlsnet.com/news/team_news.jsp?ymd=20070504&content_id=92026&vkey=pr_dcu&fext=.jsp&team=t103 |title= D.C.

On January 8, 2007, the operating rights to D.C. United were sold to [[D.C. United Holdings]], a newly formed group venture that included real estate developer Victor MacFarlane, founder of MacFarlane Partners, and [[Will Chang|William H.C.

==Broadcasting==
In 2015, the club reached a new multi-year deal with [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]'s [[American Sports Network]] division to broadcast all of the team's regionally-televised matches, beginning in the 2016 season. The matches will be split between its local cable network [[NewsChannel 8]] and Washington's ABC affiliate [[WJLA-TV]]. Sinclair and the team will split the costs of the telecasts and production roles, while the team will handle advertising sales and provide on-air commentators.<ref name=wp-sinclairdcunited>{{cite news|title=D.C.

  -- Do NOT add new players before their signing is officially announced by the club
  -- and do NOT assign unreferenced jersey numbers as well.
  -- Do NOT create articles for new draft picks until they make either their MLS or US Open Cup debut, and do not add red wikilinks to these players as it prevents the creation of articles by people who don't understand the WP:FOOTY notability guidelines
