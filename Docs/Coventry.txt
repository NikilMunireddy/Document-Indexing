Coventry is {{convert|95|mi|km}} northwest of [[central London]], {{convert|19|mi|km}} east-south-east of [[Birmingham]], {{convert|24|mi|km}} southwest of [[Leicester]] and {{convert|11|mi|km}} north of [[Warwick]]. 

[[Coventry Cathedral]] was built after the destruction of the 14th&nbsp;century cathedral church of Saint Michael by the German [[Luftwaffe]] in the  [[Coventry Blitz]] of 14 November 1940. Coventry motor companies have contributed significantly to the [[British motor industry]]. The city has two universities, [[Coventry University]] in the city centre and the [[University of Warwick]] on the southern outskirts.

==History==
<!-- Note: this is intended to be a summary of Coventry's history. Please put detailed history in the main History of Coventry article -->
{{Main|History of Coventry}}

The Romans founded another settlement in [[Baginton]] and another formed around a [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] nunnery, founded {{circa|AD&nbsp;700}} by St Osburga,<ref>[http://www.historiccoventry.co.uk/history/history.php#arden Coventry's beginnings in the Forest of Arden] Retrieved 29 September 2008</ref> that was later left in ruins by [[Canute the Great|King Canute's]] invading [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] army in 1016. Earl [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia|Leofric]] of [[Earldom of Mercia|Mercia]] and his wife [[Lady Godiva]] built on the remains of the nunnery and founded a [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[monastery]] in 1043 dedicated to St Mary.<ref>{{harvnb|Fox|1957|p=3}}</ref><ref>[http://www.coventrycathedral.org.uk/History.html The history of Coventry Cathedral on the cathedral's website] Retrieved on 28 September 2008</ref> In time, a market was established at the abbey gates and the settlement expanded.

By the 14th&nbsp;century, Coventry was an important centre of the cloth trade, and throughout the [[Middle Ages]] was one of the largest and most important cities in England. The bishops of [[Diocese of Lichfield|Lichfield]] were often referred to as bishops of Coventry and Lichfield, or Lichfield and Coventry (from 1102 to 1541). Coventry claimed the [[city status in the United Kingdom|status of a city]] by [[time immemorial|ancient prescriptive usage]], was granted a [[royal charter|charter of incorporation]] in 1345, and in 1451 became a [[County of the City of Coventry|county]] in its own right.<ref>Home Office List of English Cities by Ancient Prescriptive Right, 1927, cited in {{Cite book |title=City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002 |last=Beckett |first=J V |year=2005 |publisher=Ashgate |location=Aldershot |isbn=0-7546-5067-7

In the 18th and 19th&nbsp;centuries, Coventry became one of the three main British centres of [[watch]] and [[clock]] manufacture and ranked alongside [[Prescot]], in [[Lancashire]] and [[Clerkenwell]] in London.<ref name=cwm>{{cite web |url=http://www.coventrywatchmuseum.co.uk |title=Coventry Watch Museum Project |publisher=Coventry Watch Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrykid.com/My%20Suddens%20Branches.htm|title=John Suddens, watchmaker|accessdate=25 June 2009}}</ref> As the industry declined, due mainly to competition from [[Swiss Made]] clock and watch manufacturers, the skilled pool of workers proved crucial to the setting up of bicycle manufacture and eventually the [[motorbike]], car, [[machine tool]] and aircraft industries.

In the late 19th&nbsp;century, Coventry became a major centre of bicycle manufacture. The industry energised by the invention by [[James Starley]] and his nephew [[John Kemp Starley]] of the Rover [[safety bicycle]], which was safer and more popular than the pioneering [[penny-farthing]]. The company became [[Rover Company|Rover]]. By the early 20th&nbsp;century, bicycle manufacture had evolved into [[automobile|motor]] manufacture, and Coventry became a major centre of the [[British motor industry]]. The design headquarters of [[Jaguar Cars]] is in the city at their [[Whitley plant]] and although vehicle assembly ceased at the [[Browns Lane plant]] in 2004, Jaguar's head office returned to the city in 2011, and is also sited in Whitley. Jaguar is owned by the Indian company, [[Tata Motors]].

[[File:Coventry precinct and spire.jpg|thumb|Coventry precinct with spire of ruined cathedral in the background.]]

With many of the city's older properties becoming increasingly unfit for habitation, the first [[Council housing|council houses]] were let to their tenants in 1917. With Coventry's industrial base continuing to soar after the end of the [[World War I|Great War]] a year later, numerous private and council housing developments took place across the city in the 1920s and 1930s. The development of a southern by-pass around the city, starting in the 1930s and being completed in 1940, helped deliver more urban areas to the city on previously rural land.

Coventry suffered severe bomb damage during the Second World War. There was  a massive [[Luftwaffe]] [[Strategic bombing|air raid]], part of the "[[Coventry Blitz]]",  on 14 November 1940. [[Firebombing]] on this date led to severe damage to large areas of the city centre and to [[Coventry Cathedral|Coventry's historic cathedral]], leaving only a shell and the spire. More than 4,000 houses were damaged or destroyed, along with around three quarters of the city's industrial plants. More than 800 people were killed, with thousands injured and homeless.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/15/newsid_3522000/3522785.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY / 15 / 1940: Germans bomb Coventry to destruction|work=[[BBC News Online]] | date=15 November 1940}}</ref>

Aside from London, [[Hull Blitz|Hull]] and [[Plymouth Blitz|Plymouth]], Coventry suffered more damage than any other British city during the Luftwaffe attacks, with huge firestorms devastating most of the city centre. The city was probably targeted due to its high concentration of armaments, munitions, aircraft and aero-engine plants which contributed greatly to the British war effort, although there have been claims that [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] launched the attack as revenge for the bombing of [[Munich]] by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] six days before the Coventry Blitz and chose the Midlands city because its medieval heart was regarded as one of the finest in Britain. Following the raids, the majority of Coventry's historic buildings could not be saved as they were in ruinous states or were deemed unsafe for any future use. Several structures were demolished simply to make way for modern developments which saw the city centre's buildings and road infrastructure altered almost beyond recognition by 1970.

Further housing developments in the private and public sector took place after the Second World War, partly to accommodate the growing population of the city and also to replace condemned and bomb damaged properties, including a major prefabricated housing district in south [[Canley]] which exists to this day.

In the post-war years Coventry was largely rebuilt under the general direction of the [[Donald Gibson (architect)|Gibson Plan]], gaining a new pedestrianised shopping precinct (the first of its kind in Europe on such a scale) and in 1962 Sir [[Basil Spence]]'s much-celebrated new [[Coventry Cathedral|St Michael's Cathedral]] (incorporating one of the world's largest tapestries) was consecrated. Its prefabricated steel spire (flèche) was lowered into place by helicopter.

Major expansion to Coventry had taken place previously, in the 1920s and 1930s, to provide housing for the large influx of workers who came to work in the city's booming factories. The areas which were expanded or created in this development included [[Radford, Coventry|Radford]], [[Coundon, Coventry|Coundon]], [[Canley]], [[Cheylesmore]] and [[Stoke Heath, Coventry|Stoke Heath]].

Coventry's motor industry boomed during the 1950s and 1960s and Coventry enjoyed a 'golden age'. During this period the disposable income of Coventrians was amongst the highest in the country and both the sports and the arts benefited. A new sports centre, with one of the few Olympic standard swimming pools in the UK, was constructed and [[Coventry City Football Club]] reached the First Division of English Football. The [[Belgrade Theatre]] was also constructed along with the [[Herbert Art Gallery]]. Coventry's pedestrianised Precinct shopping area came into its own and was considered one of the finest retail experiences outside London. In 1965 the new [[University of Warwick]] campus was opened to students, and rapidly became one of the country's leading higher-education institutions.

Coventry's large industrial base made it attractive to the wave of [[Asia]]n and [[Caribbean]] [[Immigration|immigrants]] who arrived from [[Commonwealth]] colonies after 1948. In 1960, one of Britain's first [[mosque]]s—and the very first in Coventry—was opened on Eagle Street to serve the city's growing [[Islam]]ic community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/coventry.html|title=A brief history of Coventry|work=localhistories.org|first=Tim|last=Lambert|accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref> The 1970s, however, saw a decline in the British motor industry and Coventry suffered particularly badly, especially towards the end of that decade. By the early 1980s, Coventry had one of the highest unemployment rates in the country and crime rates rose well above the national average.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Some 30 years later, Coventry is now considered as one of the UK's safer major cities and has gradually recovered economically with newer industries locating there, although the motor industry continues to decline. By 2008, only one motor manufacturing plant was operational, that of LTI Ltd, producing the popular [[TX4]] taxi cabs. On 17 March 2010 LTI announced they would no longer be producing bodies and chassis in Coventry, instead producing them in [[People's Republic of China|China]] and shipping them in for final assembly in Coventry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article7066364.ece|title=Manganese Bronze: Black cabs on the road to China|last=Lea|first=Robert|date=18 March 2010|work=The Times | location=London}}</ref>

On the sporting scene, [[Coventry R.F.C.|Coventry Rugby Football Club]] was consistently among the nation's leading rugby football sides from the early 20th&nbsp;century, peaking in the 1970s and 1980s with a host of major honours and international players.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Association football]], on the other hand, was scarcely a claim to fame until 1967, when [[Coventry City F.C.]] finally won promotion to the top flight of [[Football in England|English football]] as champions of the [[Football League Second Division]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/coventry-city-fc/coventry-city-fc-news/2008/01/17/promotion-winners-the-greatest-coventry-city-player-ever-92746-20363894/|title=Promotion winners: The greatest Coventry City player ever|publisher=''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''|first=Jim|last=Brown|date=17 January 2008|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> They would stay among the elite for the next 34 years, reaching their pinnacle with [[FA Cup]] [[1987 FA Cup Final|glory]] in 1987—the first and to date only major trophy in the club's history.<ref name="ccfc records">{{cite web|url=http://www.ccfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10269~1030502,00.html|title=Club Records|work=ccfc.co.uk|publisher=[[Coventry City F.C.]]|date=23 August 2010|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref> Their long stay in the top flight of English football ended in relegation in 2001,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1310324.stm |work=news.bbc.co.uk| publisher=[[BBC Sport]] | title=Coventry relegated at Villa | date=5 May 2001}}</ref> and in 2012 they were relegated again to the third tier of English football. [[Highfield Road]], to the east of the city centre, was Coventry City's home for 106 years from 1899. They finally departed from the stadium in 2005 on their relocation to the 32,600-seat [[Ricoh Arena]] some three miles to the north of the city centre, in the Rowleys Green district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premierfootballbooks.co.uk/highfield_road.html|title=Highfield Road - Coventry City football Club|work=premierfootballbooks.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2012}}</ref> Since 2000, the city has also been home to one of the most successful [[Ice Hockey]] teams in the country, the [[Coventry Blaze]] who are four time [[Elite Ice Hockey League|Elite League]] champions.

==City boundaries==

Coventry forms the largest part of the [[Coventry and Bedworth Urban Area]].

The protected [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] [[Green belt (UK)|Green Belt]], which surrounds the city on all sides, has prevented the expansion of the city into both the administrative county of [[Warwickshire]] and the metropolitan borough of [[Solihull]] (the [[Meriden Gap]]), and has helped to prevent the coalescence of the city with surrounding towns such as [[Kenilworth]], [[Nuneaton]], [[Leamington Spa]], [[Warwick]], [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] and [[Balsall Common]].

==Places of interest==

===Cathedral===
[[File:Coventry Cathedral Ruins with Rainbow edit.jpg|thumb|right|The ruins of the old cathedral]]
[[Coventry Cathedral|St. Michael's Cathedral]] is Coventry's best-known landmark and visitor attraction. The 14th&nbsp;century church was largely destroyed by German bombing during the [[Second World War]], leaving only the outer walls and spire. At {{convert|300|ft|m|abbr=off}} high, the spire of St. Michael's is claimed to be the third tallest cathedral spire in England, after [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury]] and [[Norwich Cathedral|Norwich]].<ref>Arthur Mee, The King's England – Warwickshire; Hodder & Stoughton, 1936</ref> Due to the architectural design (in 1940 the tower had no internal wooden floors and a stone vault below the belfry) it survived the destruction of the rest of the cathedral. The new Coventry Cathedral was opened in 1962 next to the ruins of the old. It was designed by Sir [[Basil Spence]]. The cathedral contains the tapestry ''Christ in Glory'' by [[Graham Sutherland]]. The bronze statue ''St Michael's Victory over the Devil'' by [[Jacob Epstein]] is mounted on the exterior of the new cathedral near the entrance. [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[War Requiem]]'', regarded by some as his masterpiece, was written for the opening of the new cathedral.<ref>[http://www.brittenpears.org/?page=britten/works/requiem.html Britten-Pears Foundation] Retrieved 24 September 2009</ref> The cathedral was featured in the 2009 film ''[[Nativity!]]''.<ref name="nativity">{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2009/10/23/nativity-movie-could-make-coventry-a-big-star-this-christmas-92746-24995014/|title=Nativity movie could make Coventry a big star this Christmas|publisher=''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''|first=Marion|last=McMullen|date=23 October 2009|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>

The spire of the ruined cathedral forms one of the ''"three spires"'' which have dominated the city skyline since the 14th&nbsp;century, the others being those of [[Greyfriars, Coventry|Christ Church]] (of which only the spire survives) and [[Holy Trinity Church, Coventry|Holy Trinity Church]] (which is still in use).
[[File:Coventry spires-2Aug2005-2rc.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Two of Coventry's "three spires"]]

===Cultural institutions===
The [[Herbert Art Gallery and Museum]] is one of the largest cultural institutions in Coventry. Another visitor attraction in the city centre is the free-to-enter [[Coventry Transport Museum]], which has the largest collection of British-made road vehicles in the world.<ref>.http://www.transport-museum.com</ref> The most notable exhibits are the world speed record-breaking cars, [[Thrust2]] and [[ThrustSSC]]<ref>.http://www.transport-museum.com/visiting/biffa_award_land_speed_record_exhibition.aspx</ref> The museum received a refurbishment in 2004 which included the creation of a new entrance as part of the city's Phoenix Initiative project. It was a finalist for the 2005 [[Gulbenkian Prize]].

About four miles from the city centre and just outside Coventry in [[Baginton]] is the [[Lunt Fort]], a reconstructed [[Roman Empire|Roman]] fort on its original site. The [[Midland Air Museum]] is situated just within the perimeter of Coventry on land adjacent to [[Coventry Airport]] and near [[Baginton]].

Coventry was one of the main centres of watchmaking during the 18th and 19th&nbsp;centuries and as the industry declined, the skilled workers were key to setting up the cycle trade. A group of local enthusiasts founded a museum in [[Spon Street]].<ref name=cwm/>

[[File:West Midlands Police - Coventry Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Exhibits in Coventry Police Museum]]

The city's main [[police station]] in Little Park Street also hosts a museum of Coventry's police force. The museum, based underground, is split into two sections—one representing the history of the city's police force, and the other compiling some of the more unusual, interesting and grisly cases from the force's history. The museum is funded from charity donations—viewings can be made by appointment.

[[Hillfields#Coventry City Farm|Coventry City Farm]] was a small farm in an urban setting. It was mainly to educate city children who might not get out to the countryside very often. The farm closed in 2008 due to funding problems.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7291402.stm |title=City farm shuts after cash crisis |date=12 March 2008 |accessdate=28 March 2008 |work=BBC News Online}}</ref>

==Redevelopment==

[[File:MillenniumSquareCov.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Millennium Square by night, showing the Time Zone Clock designed by Francoise Schein with the Whittle Arch soaring above]]

Major improvements continue to regenerate the city centre. The Phoenix Initiative, which was designed by [[MJP Architects]], reached the final shortlist for the 2004 [[Stirling Prize|RIBA Stirling Prize]] and has now won a total of 16 separate awards. It was published in the book 'Phoenix : Architecture/Art/Regeneration' in 2004.<ref name="Phoenix">{{cite web|url=http://blackdogonline.com/all-books/phoenix.html|title=Phoenix : Architecture/Art/Regeneration|accessdate=27 August 2009|year=2004|work=Black Dog Publishing}}</ref> Further major developments are potentially afoot, particularly the Swanswell Project, which is intended to deepen Swanswell Pool and link it to [[Coventry Canal#Coventry Canal Basin|Coventry Canal Basin]], coupled with the creation of an urban marina and a wide Parisian-style boulevard. A possible second phase of the Phoenix Initiative is also in the offing, although both of these plans are still on the drawing-board. On 16 December 2007, [[IKEA]]'s first city centre store in the UK was opened, in Coventry.<ref name="ikeapress">{{cite web|url=http://www.ikea.com/ms/en_GB/about_ikea/press_room/press_release/national/southampton_opening.html|title=

The [[River Sherbourne]] runs under Coventry's city centre; the river was paved over during the rebuilding after the Second World War and is not commonly known. When the new rebuild of Coventry city centre takes place 2009 onwards, it is planned that river will be re-opened, and a river walk way will be placed alongside it in parts of the city centre.<ref>{{cite web

==Twinning with other cities; "city of peace and reconciliation"==
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in the United Kingdom}}

Coventry and [[Stalingrad]] (now [[Volgograd]]) were the world's first 'twin' cities when they established a twinning relationship during the Second World War. The relationship developed through ordinary people in Coventry who wanted to show their support for the Soviet [[Red Army]] during the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].<ref name="coventry.gov.uk2"/> The city was also subsequently twinned with [[Dresden]], as a gesture of peace and reconciliation following the Second World War. Each twin city country is represented in a specific ward of the city and in each ward has a peace garden dedicated to that twin city. Coventry is now twinned with 26 places across the world:<ref name="Coventry twinnings">{{cite web|url= http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/local-news/what-point-coventrys-twin-towns-3038605|title=Coventry's twin towns|accessdate=6 August 2013|last=Griffin|first=Mary|date=2 August 2011|work=Coventry Telegraph}}</ref><ref name="Coventry twins">{{cite web|url=http://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory/25/twin_towns_and_cities|title=Coventry - Twin towns and cities|accessdate = 6 August 2013|work = Coventry City Council.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412062545/http://www.coventry.gov.uk/directory/25/twin_towns_and_cities|archivedate =14 April 2013}}</ref>

==Education==
{{See also|List of schools in Coventry}}
[[File:Coventry university 26l07.JPG|left|thumb|The Alan Berry building, Coventry University.]]
Coventry has two universities; [[Coventry University]] is situated on a modern city centre campus while the [[University of Warwick]] lies {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km|abbr=off}} to the south of the city centre, mostly within Coventry and straddling the border with [[Warwickshire]]. The [[University of Warwick]] is one of only five universities never to have been rated outside the top ten in terms of teaching excellence and research and is a member of the prestigious [[Russell Group]]. A team from the university won the BBC TV ''[[University Challenge]]'' trophy in April 2007. [[Coventry University]] is one of only a handful of universities to run a degree course in automotive design in the [[Coventry School of Art and Design]]

Coventry also has three further education colleges within city boundaries, [[City College Coventry|City College]], [[Henley College Coventry|Henley College]] and [[Hereward College]].

Many of the secondary schools in and around Coventry are specialist colleges, such as [[Finham Park School]], which is a mathematics and IT college, a teacher training school and the only school in Coventry to offer studying the International Baccalaureate, and [[Coventry Blue Coat Church of England School]] which has recently become a specialist college of music, one of only a few in the country. [[Cardinal Wiseman Catholic School and Language College]] specialises in languages. [[Bishop Ullathorne RC School]] became a specialist college in humanities in 2006. [[Woodlands School, Coventry|Woodlands School]] in Coventry is now also a sports college, which has a newly built sport centre. [[Ernesford Grange Community Academy]], in the south east, is a specialist science college. [[Coundon Court|Coundon Court School]] is a [[Technology College]]. [[Pattison College]], a private school opened in 1949, specialises in the performing arts. There is also [[Caludon Castle School]], a business and enterprise school, which has been rebuilt over 2005–07. [[Exhall Grange School|Exhall Grange School and Science College]] is in the north of the city, although, its catchment area is north Warwickshire. There is also [[Cardinal Newman Catholic School and Community College]].

Coventry has a variety of schools: one of the oldest secondary schools is [[Sidney Stringer Academy]] which is located in the centre of the city. It is a co-educational school and has moved into a larger building costing £28&nbsp;million.

The Coventry School Foundation comprises the independent schools [[King Henry VIII School, Coventry|King Henry VIII School]] and [[Bablake School]] together with [[King Henry VIII Preparatory School]].

The Woodlands School, which is an all-boys' school, and [[Tile Hill Wood School]] are the only single-sex schools left in Coventry. However, their [[sixth form]]s have merged to form the "West Coventry 6th Form". The Westwood Academy joined in 2013 and lessons take place in mixed classes on all three sites.

The Westwood Academy, which is a [[Technology College]], is close to the University of Warwick. It is the only school in Coventry that is a CISCO Academy and has links with other educational establishments, industry and the local community.

Sherbourne Fields School is an educational [[special needs]] school for young people with physical disabilities and is located in the Coundon area. It opened in the 1960s and there are now discussions as to whether to close this school.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Arts and culture==
[[File:Godiva Festival -Electric Main Stage-3July2009.jpg|right|thumb|[[Godiva Festival]], a major event on the Coventry arts and culture calendar]]

===Literature and drama===
* The poet [[Philip Larkin]] was born and brought up in Coventry,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2009/06/02/philip_larkin_feature.shtml|title=Larkin around Coventry|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> where his father was the City Treasurer.
* During the early 19th&nbsp;century, Coventry was well-known due to author [[George Eliot]] who was born near [[Nuneaton]]. The city was the model for her famous novel ''[[Middlemarch]]'' (1871).
* The [[Coventry Carol]] is named after the city of Coventry. It was a carol performed in the play ''The Pageant of the Shearman and Tailors'', written in the 15th&nbsp;century as one of the [[Coventry Mystery Plays|Coventry Cycle Mystery Plays]]. These plays depicted the nativity story, the lyrics of the Coventry Carol referring to the [[Annunciation]] to the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], which was the basis of the Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors. These plays were traditionally performed on the steps of the (old) cathedral, and the plays are believed to have been performed for both [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] in 1484 and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] in 1584.{{dubious|date=August 2014|reason=See talk}} The Belgrade Theatre brought back the Coventry Mystery Plays in 2000 to mark the city's millennium celebrations: the theatre now produces the Mystery Plays every three years.
* The [[Belgrade Theatre]] was Britain's first purpose-built civic theatre, opened in 1958. In 1965 the world's first ''Theatre-in-Education'' (TiE) company was formed to develop theatre as a way of inspiring learning in schools. The TiE movement spread worldwide, the theatre still offers a number of programmes for young people across Coventry and has been widely recognised as a leader in the field. It was reopened in 2007 following a period of refurbishment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belgrade.co.uk/about-us/history/|title=History|work=Belgrade Theatre}}</ref>
* Novelist [[Graham Joyce]], winner of the O Henry Award is from Keresley. His World Fantasy Award winning novel "The Facts Of Life" is set in Coventry during the blitz and in the post-war rebuilding period.
* The playwright [[Alan Pollock]] was brought up in Coventry. Other playwrights associated with the city include Nick Walker and [[Chris O'Connell]] - founder of the city's Theatre Absolute.

===Music and cinema===
During the late-1970s and early 80s, Coventry was the centre of the [[2 Tone|Two Tone]] musical phenomenon, with bands such as [[the Specials]] and [[the Selecter]] coming from the city, spawning several major hit singles and albums.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The Specials achieved two UK number 1 hit singles between 1979–81, namely "[[Too Much Too Young (The Specials song)|Too Much Too Young]]" and "[[Ghost Town (The Specials song)|Ghost Town]]".

Coventry has a range of music events including an international jazz programme, the Coventry Jazz Festival, and the [[Godiva Festival]]. On the Saturday of the Godiva Festival, a carnival parade starts in the city centre and makes its way to [[War Memorial Park, Coventry|War Memorial Park]] where the festival is held.

In the film ''[[The Italian Job]]'', the famous scene of [[Mini Cooper]]s being driven at speed through [[Turin]]'s sewers was actually filmed in Coventry, using what were then the country's biggest sewer pipes, that were accessible because they were being installed. More recently various locations in Coventry have been used in the [[BAFTA]] nominated film ''The Bouncer'' starring [[Ray Winstone]], ''[[All in the Game]]'', also starring Ray Winstone (Ricoh Arena), the medical TV series ''[[Angels (TV series)|Angels]]'' (Walsgrave Hospital), the BBC sitcom ''[[Keeping Up Appearances]]'' (Stoke Aldermoor and Binley Woods districts) and in August 2006 scenes from "[[The Shakespeare Code]]", an episode of the third series of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', were filmed in the grounds of [[Ford's Hospital]]. The 2013 ITV comedy-drama ''Love and Marriage'' was also set in the city.

===History and politics===
Coventry is well known for the legendary 11th&nbsp;century exploits of [[Lady Godiva]] who rode through the city naked on horseback in protest at high taxes being levied on the cityfolk by her husband [[Leofric, Earl of Mercia]].  The residents of the city were commanded to look away as she rode, but one man did not and was allegedly struck blind. He became known as ''[[Voyeurism|Peeping Tom]]'' thus originating a new idiom, or metonym, in English.  There is a Grade II* [[listed building|listed]] statue<ref>{{IoE|469098|Bronze statue of Lady Godiva – Grade II*}}</ref> of her in the city centre, which for 18&nbsp;years had been underneath a Cathedral Lanes shopping centre canopy, removed in October 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7697036.stm|title = Godiva statue canopy comes down|work=BBC News Online

Historically Coventry was the most important seat of ribbon-making in the UK. In this industry it competed locally with Norwich and Leicester and internationally with [[St Etienne]] in France.

Coventry has been a centre of motor and cycle manufacturing from 1896.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} Starting with [[The Coventry Motor Company|Coventry Motette]], [[The Great Horseless Carriage Company]], [[Swift Motor Company]], [[Humber Limited|Humber]], [[Hillman]], [[Riley (automobile)|Riley]], [[Francis-Barnett]] and [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] and the [[Triumph Motorcycles Ltd|Triumph motorcycle]] having its origins in 1902 in a Coventry factory. The [[Massey-Ferguson]] tractor factory was situated on [[Banner Lane]], [[Tile Hill]], until it closed in the late 1990s. Although the motor industry has declined almost to the point of extinction, the [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]]
company has retained its corporate headquarters in the city (at Whitley) and an Advanced R&D team at the University of Warwick, and [[Peugeot]] still have a large parts centre in Humber Road. The famous London [[Hackney carriage|black cab taxis]] are produced in Coventry by [[London Taxis International|LTI]] and these are now the only vehicles still wholly built in Coventry.

The manufacture of [[machine tools]] was once a major industry in Coventry. [[Alfred Herbert (company)|Alfred Herbert Ltd]] became one of the largest machine tool companies in the world. In later years the company faced competition from foreign machine tool builders and ceased trading in 1983. Other Coventry machine tool manufacturers included A. C. Wickman, and Webster & Bennett. The last Coventry machine tool manufacturer was [[Arms-to-Iraq|Matrix Churchill]] which was forced to close in the wake of the [[Project Babylon|Iraqi Supergun (Project Babylon)]] scandal.

Coventry's main industries include: cars, electronic equipment, machine tools, agricultural machinery, man-made fibres, aerospace components and telecommunications equipment. In recent years, the city has moved away from manufacturing industries towards business services, finance, research, design and development, creative industries as well as logistics and leisure.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Coventry is near the [[M6 motorway|M6]], [[M69 motorway|M69]], [[M45 motorway|M45]] and [[M40 motorway]]s.

The M45, which is situated a few miles to the south-east of the city, was opened in 1959 as a spur to the original section of the [[M1 motorway]], which linked [[London]] with the midlands. This was in effect the first motorway to serve Coventry, as the section of the M6 north of the city did not open until 1971, and the M69 between Coventry and [[Leicester]] opened five years after that. The M40 is more than 10 miles south of the city centre, south of [[Warwick]], and gives the city's residents an alternate dual carriageway and motorway route to London.

It is served by the [[A45 road|A45]] and [[A46 road|A46]] dual carriageways. The A45 originally passed through the centre of the city, but was re-routed in the 1930s on the completion of the Coventry Southern Bypass, with west-bound traffic heading in the direction of [[Birmingham]] and east-bound traffic in the direction of [[Northampton]]. The A46 was re-routed to the east of the city in 1989 on the completion of the Coventry Eastern Bypass, which directly leads to the M6/M69 interchange. To the south, it gives a direct link to the M40, making use of the existing Warwick and [[Kenilworth]] Bypasses.

Coventry has an inner [[A4053 road|ring road]] which was completed in the early 1970s and [[Phoenix Way (road)|Phoenix Way]], a dual-carriageway running north–south completed in 1995, linking the city centre with the M6 motorway.

[[Coventry railway station]] is served by the [[West Coast Main Line]], with services provide by [[Virgin Trains]], [[London Midland]] and [[Cross country trains|Cross Country]]. It has rail services between London and Birmingham (and stations beyond). It is also served by railway lines to [[Nuneaton]] via [[Bedworth]]. There is a line linking it to [[Leamington Spa]] and onwards to the south coast. Coventry has two suburban railway stations in [[Canley railway station|Canley]] and in [[Tile Hill railway station|Tile Hill]]. A [[Coventry Arena railway station|new rail station]] serving the north of city on the [[Coventry to Nuneaton Line]]) opened in January 2016.

[[Bus]] operators in Coventry include [[National Express Coventry]], [[Travel de Courcey]] and [[Stagecoach in Warwickshire]]. [[Pool Meadow Bus Station]] is the main bus and coach [[Transport hub|interchange]] in the city centre. Coventry has a single Park and Ride service from War Memorial Park served by Stagecoach in Warwickshire.<ref>http://www.networkwestmidlands.com/parkandride/indexparkandride.aspx>http://www.networkwestmidlands.com/parkandride/indexparkandride.aspx</ref>

The nearest major airports are [[Birmingham International Airport (UK)|Birmingham International Airport]], some {{convert|11|mi|km}} to the west of the city and [[Coventry Airport]] in [[Baginton]], located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} south of the city centre.

The [[Coventry Canal]] terminates near the city centre at [[Coventry Canal#Coventry Canal Basin|Coventry Canal Basin]] and is navigable for {{convert|38|mi|km}} to [[Fradley Junction]] in [[Staffordshire]].

==Waste management==
Coventry has an [[waste-to-energy|energy from waste]] [[incinerator]]<ref>[http://www.cswdc.co.uk/energyfromwaste.html Coventry & Solihull Waste Disposal Company]. CSWDC. Retrieved on 17 July 2013.</ref> which burns rubbish from both Coventry and [[Solihull]], producing electricity for the [[National Grid (UK)|National Grid]] and some hot water that is used locally through the Heatline project.<ref>[http://www.coventry.gov.uk/info/10106/major_developments/1020/heatline Heatline - Heatline - Coventry City Council]. Coventry.gov.uk. Retrieved on 17 July 2013.</ref> Rubbish is still put into [[landfill]].

* Many areas of Coventry have kerb-side plastic, metal (tins and cans), and [[paper recycling]]. Garden-green rubbish is collected and composted.
* Waste materials can be taken to the recycling depot, which is adjacent to the incineration unit.
* There are recycling points throughout the City for paper, [[glass recycling]] and metal / tin can recycling.

In October 2006, Coventry City Council signed the [[Nottingham Declaration]], joining 130 other UK councils in committing to reduce the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions of the council and to help the local community do the same.

==Local and national government==
[[File:Coventry Council House 14g06.JPG|thumb|right|The Council House, Coventry]]
Traditionally a part of [[Warwickshire]] (although it was [[County of the City of Coventry|a county in its own right]] for 400 years), Coventry became an independent [[county borough]] in 1889. It later became a [[metropolitan district]] of the [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands county]] under the Local Government Act (1974), even though it was entirely separate to the Birmingham conurbation area (this is why Coventry appears to unnaturally "jut out" into Warwickshire on political maps of the UK). In 1986, the [[West Midlands County Council]] was abolished and Coventry became administered as an effective [[unitary authority]] in its own right.

Coventry is administered by [[Coventry City Council]], controlled since 2010 by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led since May 2016 by George Duggins.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/coventry-city-council-leader-ann-11297241|title=Coventry City Council leader Ann Lucas ousted in Labour Party coup |date=6 May 2016|work=Coventry Telegraph|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref> The city is divided up into 18 [[ward (politics)|Wards]] each with three [[councillor]]s. The chairman of the [[Coventry City Council|council]] is the [[Lord Mayor of Coventry|Lord Mayor]], who has a casting vote.

Certain local services are provided by West Midlands wide agencies including the [[West Midlands Police]], the [[West Midlands Fire Service]] and the [[West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive]] (Centro) which is responsible for [[public transport]].

In 2006, Coventry and Warwickshire Ambulance Service was merged with the [[West Midlands Ambulance Service]]. The Warwickshire and Northamptonshire [[Air Ambulance]] service is based at [[Coventry Airport]] in Baginton.

Coventry is represented in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] by three [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] all of whom are Labour. These are:
* [[Colleen Fletcher]] – ([[Coventry North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry North East]])
* [[Jim Cunningham (UK politician)|Jim Cunningham]] – ([[Coventry South (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry South]])
* [[Geoffrey Robinson]] – ([[Coventry North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry North West]])

Up until 1997, Coventry was represented by four Members of Parliament, whereupon the Coventry South West and Coventry South East constituencies were merged to form Coventry South.

At the Annual Meeting of the City Council on 16 May 2013, Councillor Gary Crookes was elected as the new Lord Mayor of Coventry.

==Accent==
'''Origins''':
Coventry in a linguistic sense looks both ways, towards both the 'West' and 'East' Midlands.<ref name="Chinn">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/coventry/content/articles/2005/01/07/voices_05_chinn_history_feature.shtml|title=What did the Vikings ever do for us? |date=18 April 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2009 |work=BBC News Online}}</ref> One thousand years ago, the extreme west of Warwickshire, what today we would designate Birmingham and the Black Country was then separated from Coventry and east Warwickshire by the forest of [[Arden, Warwickshire|Arden]], with resulting inferior means of communication.<ref name="Chinn"/> The west Warwickshire settlements too were smaller in comparison to Coventry which, by the 14th&nbsp;century, was England's third city.<ref name="Chinn"/> Even as far back as Anglo-Saxon times Coventry—situated as it was, close to [[Watling Street]]—was a trading and market post between King Alfred's Saxon Mercia and [[Danelaw]] England with a consequent merging of dialects.<ref name="Trugill">{{Cite book |title= English Accents:An Introduction to Social and Regional Varieties of English in the British Isles |editor1-last=Trugill |editor1-first= Peter |editor2-last= Hughes |editor2-first=Arthur |editor3-last= Watt |editor3-first= Dominic|year= 2005 |publisher=Hodder Stoughton |isbn= 978-0-340-88718-9}}</ref>

'''Coventry and Birmingham accents''':
Phonetically the accent of Coventry is similar to Northern English in that it does not have the [[trap-bath split]], so cast is pronounced {{IPA|/kæst/}} rather than {{IPA|/kɑːst/}}.<ref name="Trugill"/> Yet the clipped, flatter vowels in the accent also contain traces of [[Estuary English]] (T-glottaling), increasingly so amongst the young since 1950.<ref name="Trugill"/> One notable feature which television producers have been apt to overlook is the distinction between Coventry and Birmingham accents. In Birmingham and the Black Country 'Old' and 'cold' may be pronounced as "owd" and "cowd", this linguistic feature stops starkly as one moves beyond Solihull in the general direction of Coventry, a possible approximation of the 'Arden Forest' divide perhaps.  Yet accents alter briskly in this particular part of the Midlands, North Warwickshire (Bedworth & Nuneaton) displays increased East Midlands dialect features.<ref name="Chinn"/> Then again, just to the south, the general Southern English feature of the longer 'a' in words such as "bath" and "path" (becoming like the [[nonce word]]s "barth" and "parth" as pronounced in a [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic accent]]) starts to occur regardless of class or geodemographic grouping across an east to west band of settlements somewhere between Southam and Banbury, positioning Coventry right at the edge of England's phonetic crossroads.<ref name="Trugill"/>

'''Coventry accent on television''':
Dramatic representations on film have been very uneven down the years, ranging from Yorkshire sounding builders visiting the Queen Vic in ''[[EastEnders]]'' [1987] to Black Country sounding factory workers in the Jeffrey Archer adaptation 'First Among Equals' (1984).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.episodeworld.com/show/EastEnders/season=22/English.html|title=Eastenders Episode Guide|date=1 October 2009|accessdate=1 October 2009}}</ref> The BBC's 2009 documentary ''The Bombing of Coventry'' contained useful phonetic data on the 'Coventry Accent' in the form of interviews with Coventrians. A recent performance from the actress Becci Gemmell, playing Coventry character Joyce in the BBC drama ''[[Land Girls]]'', also gave a more accurate phonetic representation of the accent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/04/landgirls.shtml |title=Land Girls Press Pack|date=3 June 2009|accessdate=10 October 2009 |work=BBC News Online}}</ref>

==2008 bomb scare==

The city was bombed many times during the [[Second World War]] by the [[Luftwaffe]]. These bombs were often abandoned if they fell in areas of little significant importance to the war effort, and continue to be found during construction work to this day. Many old bombs were found to still be viable explosive devices. On 12 March 2008, an unexploded Second World War Luftwaffe bomb was discovered in Coventry's city centre. Police said the device seemed genuine but it was not clear if it was live.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7292097.stm|title = 'World War II bomb' found in city|accessdate =27 March 2008|date = 12 March 2008|work=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher=BBC}}</ref>  A cordon of 500 metres was enforced. In an ironic coincidence the finding of the bomb led to a performance of "One Night in November", a play about the [[Coventry Blitz|Blitz]], being cancelled.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-176641736.html|title = Belgrade's air-raid drama cancelled by wartime bomb|accessdate=7 April 2010|work=[[Highbeam Research]]|publisher=Highbeam}}</ref>  A [[Royal Engineers]] [[bomb disposal]] team conducted a controlled explosion early on the morning of 13 March 2008.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7293488.stm|title = Controlled explosion on World War II bomb|accessdate =27 March 2008|date = 13 March 2008|work=[[BBC News Online]]|publisher=BBC}}</ref>
