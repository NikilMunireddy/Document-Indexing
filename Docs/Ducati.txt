'''Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A.''' is an Italian company that designs and manufactures motorcycles. Headquartered in [[Bologna, Italy]], Ducati is owned by German automotive  manufacturer [[Audi]] through its Italian subsidiary [[Lamborghini]], which is all owned by the [[Volkswagen Group]].<ref name=audi_ifr_2012/>

==History==
[[File:1920s Ducati logo.jpg|thumb|left|The first Ducati logo, 1926–1930s<ref>{{Cite journal |first=Livio |last=Lodi |year=2009 |url=http://www.ducati.com/heritage/news/storialogo.jhtml |title=History of the Ducati Logo: The 1920s |publisher=Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. }}</ref>]] In 1926 Antonio Cavalieri Ducati and his three sons, Adriano, Marcello, and Bruno Cavalieri Ducati; founded ''Società Scientifica Radio Brevetti Ducati'' in Bologna to produce [[vacuum tube]]s, [[Capacitor|condensers]] and other radio components. In 1935 they had become successful enough to enable construction of a new factory in the Borgo Panigale area of the city.  Production was maintained during World War II, despite the Ducati factory being a repeated target of Allied bombing.
[[File:Ducati Werk.JPG|thumb|left|Ducati Factory]]
[[File:Ducati Vilar Cucciolo 1950.jpg|left|thumb|Ducati "Cucciolo", 1950]]
Meanwhile, at the small [[Turin]]ese firm SIATA (''Societa Italiana per Applicazioni Tecniche Auto-Aviatorie''), Aldo Farinelli began developing a small [[pushrod]] [[Motorized bicycle|engine for mounting on bicycles]]. Barely a month after the official liberation of Italy in 1944, SIATA announced its intention to sell this engine, called the [[Ducati Cucciolo|"Cucciolo"]] (Italian for "puppy," in reference to the distinctive exhaust sound) to the public. The first Cucciolos were available alone, to be mounted on standard bicycles, by the buyer; however, businessmen soon bought the little engines in quantity, and offered complete motorized-bicycle units for sale.

In 1950, after more than 200,000 Cucciolos had been sold, in collaboration with SIATA, the Ducati firm finally offered its own Cucciolo-based motorcycle. This first Ducati motorcycle was a 48&nbsp;cc bike weighing {{convert|98|lb|abbr=on}} with a top speed of {{convert|40|mph|0|abbr=on}} had a 15&nbsp;mm [[carburetor]] giving just under {{Convert|200|mpgus|abbr=on}}. Ducati soon dropped the Cucciolo name in favor of "55M" and "65TL".
[[File:Scooters.Assisi026.jpg|thumb|Ducati 175 Cruiser, 1952]]
[[File:Ducati mach1 800.jpg|thumb|[[Ducati Mach 1]]]]
When the market moved toward larger motorcycles, Ducati management decided to respond, making an impression at an early-1952 Milan show, introducing their 65TS cycle and Cruiser (a four-stroke [[motor scooter]]). Despite being described as the most interesting new machine at the 1952 show, the Cruiser was not a great success, and only a few thousand were made over a two-year period before the model ceased production.

In 1953, management split the company into two separate entities, Ducati Meccanica SpA and Ducati Elettronica, in acknowledgment of its diverging motorcycle and electronics product lines. Ducati Elettronica became [[Ducati Energia|Ducati Energia SpA]] in the eighties. Dr. Giuseppe Montano took over as head of Ducati Meccanica SpA and the Borgo Panigale factory was modernized with government assistance. By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day.

In the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250&nbsp;cc road bike then available, the [[Ducati Mach 1|Mach 1]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ducati.com/heritage/anni60/mach1/mach1.jhtml|title=Mach 1|publisher=ducati.com|accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sec.edgar-online.com/2004/06/30/0001156973-04-000783/section5.asp|title=DUCATI MOTOR HOLDING SPA Annual and Transition Report (foreign private issuer) (20-F) Item 4.

In 1985, [[Cagiva]] bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the Cagiva name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the "Ducati" name on its motorcycles. Eleven years later, in 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer from [[Texas Pacific Group]] and sold a 51% stake in the company for US$325 million; then, in 1998, Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49% to become the sole owner of Ducati. In 1999, TPG issued an [[initial public offering]] of Ducati stock and renamed the company ''Ducati Motor Holding SpA''. TPG sold over 65% of its shares in Ducati, leaving TPG the majority shareholder. In December 2005, Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific's stake (minus one share) to [[Investindustrial]] Holdings, the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi.

In April 2012, [[Volkswagen Group]]'s [[Audi]] subsidiary announced its intention to buy Ducati for €{{Format price|860000000}} (US${{Format price|1200000000}}). Volkswagen chairman [[Ferdinand Piëch]], a motorcycle enthusiast, had long coveted Ducati, and had regretted that he passed up an opportunity to buy the company from the Italian government in 1984. Analysts doubted a tiny motorcycle maker would have a meaningful effect on a company the size of Volkswagen, commenting that the acquisition has "a trophy feel to it," and, "is driven by VW's passion for nameplates rather than industrial or financial logic". Italian luxury car brand [[Lamborghini]] was strengthened under VW ownership.<ref name=Cremer2012>{{Cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/17/audi-ducati-idUSL6E8FH5DR20120417 |title=UPDATE 2-Audi to pay about 860 mln euros for Ducati |agency=Reuters |publisher=Thomson Reuters |date=April 17, 2012 |first1=Andreas |last1=Cremer |first2=Christiaan |last2=Hetzner |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}</ref><ref name=Schultz2012>{{Citation |date= April 18, 2012 |title= Volkswagen Group to Add Ducati to Product Portfolio |first= Jonathan |last= Schultz |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |url= http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/volkswagen-group-adds-ducati-to-product-portfolio |accessdate= April 18, 2012 }}</ref> AUDI AG's Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A. subsidiary acquired 100 percent of the shares of Ducati Motor Holding S.p.A. on July 19, 2012 for €{{Format price|747000000}} (US${{Format price|909323100}}).<ref name=audi_ifr_2012/>

[[File:PaulSmartLE1000.jpg|thumb|2006 [[Ducati PaulSmart 1000 LE]]]]
Ducati is best known for high-performance motorcycles characterized by large-capacity [[four-stroke engine|four-stroke]], 90° [[V-twin engine]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ducati.com/bikes/techcafe.jhtml?detail=article&value=technical&part=technical&artID=1|title=History of the Two-Valve Twin|publisher=Ducati.com|accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> with a [[desmodromic]] valve design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ducati.com/bikes/techcafe.jhtml?detail=article&value=technical&part=technical&artID=2|title=Desmo for Dummies|publisher=Ducati.com|accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> Ducati refers to this configuration as L-twin because one cylinder is vertical while the other is horizontal, making it look like a letter "L". Modern Ducatis remain among the dominant performance motorcycles available today partly because of the desmodromic valve design, which is nearing its 50th year of use. Desmodromic valves are closed with a separate, dedicated cam lobe and lifter instead of the conventional valve [[spring (device)|springs]] used in most internal combustion engines in consumer vehicles. This allows the cams to have a more radical profile, thus opening and closing the valves more quickly without the risk of valve-float, which causes a loss of power that is likely when using a "passive" closing mechanism under the same conditions.

While most other manufacturers use [[wet clutch]]es (with the spinning parts bathed in oil)<ref name="Transmissions">{{cite web|url=http://www.yamaha-motor.ca/our_company/news_item.php?news_id=45|title=What is in an oil|publisher=yamaha-motor.ca|accessdate=2008-01-25}}</ref> Ducati previously used multiplate [[dry clutch]]es in many of their motorcycles. The dry clutch eliminates the [[parasitic loss|power loss from oil viscosity]] drag on the engine, even though the engagement may not be as smooth as the oil-bath versions, but the clutch plates can wear more rapidly.  Ducati has converted to wet clutches across their current product lines.

Ducati also extensively uses a [[Space frame|trellis frame]], although Ducati's MotoGP project broke with this tradition by introducing a revolutionary carbon fibre frame for the Ducati Desmosedici GP9.

==Product history==
{{see also|Ducati Museum}}
The chief designer of most Ducati motorcycles in the 1950s was [[Fabio Taglioni]] (1920–2001). His designs ranged from the small single-cylinder machines that were successful in the Italian 'street races' to the large-capacity twins of the 1980s. Ducati introduced the [[Ducati Pantah|Pantah]] in 1979; its engine was updated in the 1990s in the [[Ducati SuperSport]] (SS) series. All modern Ducati engines are derivatives of the Pantah, which uses a toothed belt to actuate the engine's valves. Taglioni used the [[Ferrari#Identity|Cavallino Rampante]] (identified with the [[Ferrari]] brand) on his Ducati motorbikes, Taglioni chose this emblem of courage and daring as a sign of respect and admiration for [[Francesco Baracca]], a heroic World War I fighter pilot who died during an air raid in 1918.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ducati.com/heritage/protagonisti/fabiotaglioni6.jhtml|title=Fabio Taglioni: a Legend|publisher=ducati.com|accessdate=25 January 2008}}</ref>

In 1973, Ducati commemorated its 1972 win at the [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] 200 with the production model green frame Ducati 750 SuperSport.

Ducati also targeted the offroad market with the two-stroke Regolarità 125, building 3,486 models from 1975 to 1979, but the bike was not successful.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/the-ducati-regolarita.aspx|title=Ducati Regolarità 125 |publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=15 December 2011|date=January–February 2011|author=Alan Cathcart}}</ref>

In 1975, the company introduced the [[Ducati 860 GT|860 GT]], designed by noted car stylist [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]. Its angular lines were unique, but raised handlebars made for an uncomfortable seating position at high speeds and also caused steering issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/1975-ducati-860-gt.aspx|title=1975 Ducati 860GT|publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=18 July 2011|date=July–August 2011|author=Roland Brown}}</ref>

===1980s===
{{main|Ducati Desmoquattro engine}}

Ducati's liquid-cooled multi-valve V-twins made from 1985 on are known as ''Desmoquattro'' ("[[desmodromic valve]] four"). These include the 851, [[Ducati 916|916]] and [[Ducati 996|996]], [[Ducati 999|999]] and a few predecessors and derivatives.

{{Main|Ducati Paso}}
[[File:907ie.JPG|thumb|1993 Ducati 907 i.e.]]
The Ducati Paso was introduced in 1986 with the Paso 750, followed in 1989 with the Paso 906. The final version came in 1991 with the 907IE (Iniezione Elettronica), now without the name "Paso". The design was from the hand of [[Massimo Tamburini]], who also designed the [[Ducati 916]] and [[MV Agusta F4 series|MV Agusta F4]]. The Paso was a typical "you love it, you hate it" bike. However, at that time it looked like that all-enclosed bodywork would be the future for all motorcycles. The Paso design was copied for the [[Moto Morini|Moto Morini Dart 400]] and [[:it:Cagiva Freccia|Cagiva Freccia]] 125. Together with Tamburini's [[Bimota DB1]], they were enormously influential in terms of styling.

===1990s===
In 1993, [[Miguel Angel Galluzzi]] introduced the [[Ducati Monster]],<ref name="monster">{{cite web|url=http://www.monsta.at/site_article_368.html|title=Desmo 2 Valve History|publisher=monsta.at|accessdate=25 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071218170044/http://www.monsta.at/site_article_368.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 18 December 2007}}</ref> a naked bike with exposed trellis and engine. Today the Monster accounts for almost half of the company's worldwide sales. The Monster has undergone the most changes of any motorcycle that Ducati has ever produced.

In 1993, [[Pierre Terblanche]], Massimo Bordi and Claudio Domenicali designed the [[Ducati Supermono]]. A 550&nbsp;cc single-cylinder lightweight "Catalog Racer". Only 67 were built between 1993 and 1997.

In 1994, the company introduced the [[Ducati 916]] model designed by [[Massimo Tamburini]],<ref name="Ducati916">{{cite web|url=http://www.ducati.com/heritage/anni90/916sbk95/916sbk95.jhtml|title=Ducati Official History (The 916)|publisher=Ducati Motor Holdings|accessdate=22 June 2008}}</ref> a water-cooled version that allowed for higher output levels and a striking new bodywork that had aggressive lines, an underseat exhaust, and a single-sided swingarm. Ducati has since ceased production of the 916, supplanting it (and its progeny, the [[Ducati 748|748]], [[Ducati 996|996]] and [[Ducati 998|998]]) with the [[Ducati 749|749]] and [[Ducati 999|999]].

===2000s===
In 2006, the retro-styled [[Ducati PaulSmart 1000 LE]] was released, which shared styling cues with the 1973 750 SuperSport (itself a production replica of [[Paul Smart (motorcycle racer)|Paul Smart]]'s 1972 race winning [[Ducati 750 Imola Desmo|750 Imola Desmo]]), as one of a [[Ducati SportClassic|SportClassic]] series representing the 750 GT, 750 Sport, and 750 SuperSport Ducati motorcycles.

==Motorcycle design history==
[[File:2007DucatiSR4-001.jpg|thumb|left|2007 [[Ducati Monster|Ducati Monster S4Rs Testastretta]]]]
Ducati has produced several styles of motorcycle engines, including varying the number of cylinders, type of valve actuation and fuel delivery. Ducati is best known for its [[V-twin engine]], called a L-twin by the company, which is the powerplant in the majority of Ducati-marqued motorcycles.
Ducati has also manufactured engines with one, two, three or four cylinders; operated by pull rod valves and push rod valves; single, double and triple overhead camshafts; [[two-stroke]] and even at one stage manufactured small diesel engines, many of which were used to power boats, generators, garden machinery and emergency pumps (for example, for fire fighting). The engines were the IS series from {{convert|7|to|22|hp|abbr=on}} air-cooled and the larger twin DM series water- and air-cooled. The engines have been found in all parts of the globe. Wisconsin Diesel even assembled and "badge engineered" the engines in the USA. They have also produced outboard motors for marine use. Currently, Ducati makes no other engines except for its motorcycles.

On current Ducati motors, except for the Desmosedici and 1199 Panigale, the valves are actuated by a standard valve cam shaft which is rotated by a [[timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]] driven by the motor directly. The teeth on the belt keep the [[camshaft]] drive pulleys indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to the camshaft through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older [[single-cylinder]] motorcycles — the shaft tube is visible on the outside of the cylinder.

Ducati is also famous for using the desmodromic valve system championed by engineer and designer Fabio Taglioni, though the firm has also used engines that use valve springs to close their valves. In the early days, Ducati reserved the desmodromic valve heads for its higher performance bikes and its race bikes. These valves do not suffer from [[valve float]] at high engine speeds, thus a desmodromic engine is capable of far higher revolutions than a similarly configured engine with traditional spring-valve heads.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Ducati produced a wide range of small two-stroke bikes, mainly sub-100&nbsp;cc capacities. Large quantities of some models were exported to the United States.

Ducati has produced the following motorcycle engine types:
* Single-cylinder,
**pullrod actuated, 48&nbsp;cc and 65&nbsp;cc (Cucciolo)

==Enthusiasts groups==
A key part of Ducati's marketing strategy since the 1990s has been fostering a distinct community identity in connection with branding efforts including online communities and local, regional and national Ducati enthusiast clubs. There are more than 400 Ducati clubs worldwide and 20,000 registered users of the Ducati Owners Club web site and 17,000 subscribers to the racing web site.<ref>{{Cite journal |publisher=Global Co-Operation in the New Millennium The 9th European Conference on Information Systems |location=Bled, Slovenia |date=June 27–29, 2001 |title=EMBARKING ON E-BUSINESS AT DUCATI MOTORCYCLES (ITALY) <nowiki>[CASE STUDY]</nowiki> |first1=Tawfik |last1=Jelassi |first2=Stefanie |last2=Leenen |url=http://is2.lse.ac.uk/Support/ECIS2001/pdf/040_Jelassi.pdf |format=PDF }}</ref> Enthusiasts and riders are informally referred to in the motorcycling community as Ducatista (singular) or Ducatisti (plural).

In North America there are several Ducati enthusiasts organizations with varying degrees of factory sponsorship. DESMO, the Ducati Enthusiast Sport Motorcycle Organization, is a North American group affiliated with the factory Desmo Owners Club.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Desmo Owners Club |publisher=Ducati Motor Holding |year=2009 |url=http://www.ducati.com/ducatiworld/clubs/home.jsp }}</ref> Some groups are focused on vintage Ducatis<ref>{{cite web |title=Ducati Vintage Club Homepage |url=http://www.ducativintageclub.com/ }}</ref> while several are based primarily or entirely on email discussion lists or web forums.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=kEX7Ncd3hO4C&pg=PA186 | title=The Savvy Guide to Motorcycles |first=Shirley |last=Duglin Kennedy |publisher=Indy Tech Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=9780790613161 }}</ref>

==Ducati products other than motorcycles==
[[File:Ducati radio receiver.jpg|thumb|1942 Ducati radio]]
Ducati Meccanica (as the company was previously known) has its marque on non-motorcycle products as well. In the 1930s and 1940s, Ducati manufactured radios, cameras, and electrical products such as a razor. Ducati made a marine [[binoculars|binocular]] called the BIMAR for the [[Kriegsmarine]] during World War II, some of which were sold on the civilian market after the war.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.binoculars-cinecollectors.com/BIMAR-Ducati-Appendix2.pdf|title=BIMAR: The little known history of the Ducati 20° inclined 10x80 binoculars|author= Giuseppe Finizio|editor=Anna Vacani|date=|publisher=Anna and Terry Vacani's Binocular & Cine Collection|accessdate=2013-03-19}}</ref> The [[Ducati Sogno]] was a [[half-frame]] [[Leica Camera|Leica]]-like camera which is now a collector's item.

Currently, there are four Ducati companies: Ducati Motor Holding (the subject of this article), [[Ducati Corse]] (which runs the Ducati racing program and is wholly owned by Ducati Motor Holding), [[Ducati Energia]], a designer and manufacturer of electrical and electronic components and systems and Ducati Sistemi, a subsidiary of Ducati Energia. All are located in [[Borgo Panigale]] in Bologna, Italy.

Ducati Motor Holding often uses electrical components and subsystems from Ducati Energia.

==Merchandising==
Ducati has a wide range of accessories, lifestyle products and co-branded merchandise bearing their logos and designs. The company has a licensing agreement with [[Tumi Inc.]], launching a collection of eight co-branded [[luggage]] pieces in 2006 sold through both of the brands' retail outlets.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/07/01/0124_tumi/source/5.htm|title=Tumi Time: Tumi+Ducati Collection|publisher=[[Business Week]]|date=2007-01-24|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>

Ducati had an important place in early Superbike racing history in the United States and vice versa: In 1977, [[Cycle (magazine)|''Cycle'' magazine]] editors [[Cook Neilson]] and [[Phil Schilling]] took a Ducati 750SS to first place at Daytona in the second-ever season of AMA Superbike racing. "Neilson retired from racing at the end of the year, but the bike he and Schilling built — nicknamed Old Blue for its blue livery — became a legend," says Richard Backus from Motorcycle Classics: "How big a legend? Big enough for Ducati to team with Italian specialty builder NCR to craft a limited-edition update, New Blue, based on the 2007 Sport 1000S, and big enough to inspire the crew at the Barber Vintage Motorsports Museum (see [[Barber Motorsports Park]]), arguably one of the most important motorcycle museums in the world, to commission Ducati specialist Rich Lambrechts to craft a bolt-by-bolt replica for its collection. The finished bike's name? Deja Blue."<ref>{{cite web |author=January/February 2009 By Richard Backus&nbsp; |url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/Motorcycle-reviews/One-famous-Ducati-750SS.aspx |title=One famous Ducati 750SS |publisher=Motorcycleclassics.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref>
