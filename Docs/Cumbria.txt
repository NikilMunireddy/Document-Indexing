'''Cumbria''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˈ|k|ʌ|m|b|r|i|ə}} {{respell|KUM|bree-ə}}; [[Cumbrian dialect|locally]] {{IPA-endia|ˈkʊmbɾiə|}} {{respell|KUUM|bree-ə}}) is a [[non-metropolitan county]] in [[North West England]]. The county and [[Cumbria County Council]], its [[local authority]], came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the [[Local Government Act 1972]]. Cumbria's largest settlement and county town is [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and the only other major urban area is [[Barrow-in-Furness]] on the south-western tip of the county.

The county of Cumbria consists of six [[Districts of England|districts]] ([[Allerdale]], [[Barrow-in-Furness (borough)|Barrow-in-Furness]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Copeland (borough)|Copeland]], [[Eden, Cumbria|Eden]] and [[South Lakeland]]), and in 2008 had a population of just under half a million. Cumbria is one of the most sparsely populated counties in the United Kingdom, with 73.4 people per km<sup>2</sup> (190/sq mi).

Cumbria, the [[List of ceremonial counties of England by area|third-largest ceremonial county in England]] by area, is bounded to the north by the [[Subdivisions of Scotland|Scottish council area]]s of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and [[Scottish Borders]], to the west by the [[Irish Sea]], to the south by [[Lancashire]], to the southeast by [[North Yorkshire]], and to the east by [[County Durham]] and [[Northumberland]].

Cumbria is predominantly rural and contains the [[Lake District]] and [[Lake District National Park]], considered one of England's most outstanding areas of natural beauty, serving as inspiration for artists, writers, and musicians. A large area of the south east of the county is within the [[Yorkshire Dales National Park]]. Much of Cumbria is mountainous, and it contains every peak in England over {{convert|3000|ft|m}} above sea level, with [[Scafell Pike]] at {{convert|3209|ft|m}} being the highest point of England. An upland, coastal, and rural area, Cumbria's history is characterised by invasions, migration, and settlement, as well as battles and skirmishes between the English and the Scots. Historic sites in Cumbria include [[Carlisle Castle]], [[Furness Abbey]], and [[Hadrian's Wall]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Cumbria}}
[[File:Castlerigg2.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Castlerigg stone circle]] dates from the late [[Neolithic|Neolithic age]] and was constructed by some of the earliest inhabitants of Cumbria]]

At the end of the period of British history known as [[Roman Britain]] (c. {{sc|a.d.}} 410) the inhabitants of [[Cumberland]] (the county called Cumbria having been created in 1974 from Cumberland, [[Furness|Lancashire over the sands]], [[Westmorland]] and a small part of the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]) were [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]]-speaking native "Romano-Britons" who were probably descendants of the [[Brigantes]] and [[Carvetii]] (sometimes considered to be a sub-tribe of the Brigantes) that the [[Roman Empire]] had conquered in about {{sc|a.d.}} 85.  (Cumbric was a language related to [[Old Welsh]] and there are many [[Cumbrian dialect]] words and phrases which take their origins from this language){{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Based on inscriptional evidence from the area, the Roman [[civitas]] of the Carvetii seems to have covered portions of Cumbria. The names "Cumbria", "Cymru" (the native [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name for [[Wales]]), "Cambria" (the medieval Latinization of Welsh Cymru) and "Cumberland" are derived from the name these people gave themselves, ''*kombroges'' in [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]], which originally meant 'compatriots'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=cymru&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymological Dictionary '&#39;Cymric'&#39; |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=Davies>{{cite book

During the [[Early Middle Ages]] Cumberland formed the core of the [[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]] kingdom of [[Rheged]].  For the rest of the first millennium, Cumbria was contested by several entities who warred over the area, including the Brythonic [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] and the [[Angles|Anglian]] [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. Most of modern-day Cumbria was a principality in the Kingdom of [[Scotland]] at the time of the [[Norman Conquest]] of England in 1066 and thus was excluded from the [[Domesday Book]] survey of 1086.  In 1092 Cumberland was invaded by [[William II of England|William II]] and incorporated into England.  Nevertheless, the region was dominated by the many wars and [[Anglo-Scottish Wars|border skirmishes]] between England and Scotland of the Latter Middle Ages and [[Early Modern Period]], and the associated [[Border Reivers]] who exploited the dynamic political situation of the region.  There were at least three [[Siege of Carlisle (disambiguation)|sieges of Carlisle]] fought between England and Scotland, and two further sieges during the [[Jacobite Risings]].

After the Jacobite Risings of the eighteenth century, Cumberland became a more stable place and, as in the rest of [[Northern England]], the [[Industrial Revolution]] caused a large growth in urban populations.  In particular, the west-coast towns of [[Workington]], [[Millom]] and [[Barrow-in-Furness]] saw large iron and [[steelworks]] develop, with Barrow also developing a significant [[shipbuilding]] industry.  [[Kendal]], [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]] and Carlisle all became [[mill town]]s, with textiles, pencils and biscuits among the products manufactured in the region.  The early nineteenth century saw the county gain fame as the [[Lake Poets]] and other artists of the [[Romanticism|romantic movement]], such as [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], lived among, and were inspired by, the lakes and mountains of the region.  Later, the children's writer [[Beatrix Potter]] also wrote in the region and became a major landowner, granting much of her property to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] on her death.  In turn, the large amount of land owned by the National Trust assisted in the formation of the [[Lake District]] [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]] in 1951, which remains the largest National Park in England and has come to dominate the identity and economy of the county.

The county of Cumbria was created in [[Local Government Act 1972|1974]] from the traditional counties of Cumberland and [[Westmorland]], the Cumberland [[County Borough of Carlisle]], along with the North Lonsdale or [[Furness]] part of [[Lancashire]], usually referred to as "Lancashire North of the Sands", (including the [[county borough]] of [[Barrow-in-Furness]]) and, from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], the [[Sedbergh Rural District]]. Its strategic authority is [[Cumbria County Council]].

Local papers ''The [[Westmorland Gazette]]'' and ''Cumberland and Westmorland Herald'' continue to use the name of their historic county.  Other publications, such as local government promotional material, describe the area as "Cumbria", as do the [[Lake District]] National Park Authority and most visitors.

==Geography==
[[File:Cumbria SRTM.png|thumb|left|Topographic map of Cumbria]]
Cumbria is the most northwesterly county of England. The northernmost and southernmost points in Cumbria are just west of [[Deadwater, Northumberland]] and [[Walney Island|South Walney]] respectively. [[Kirkby Stephen]] (close to [[Tan Hill, Yorkshire]]) and [[St Bees Head]] are the most easterly and westerly points of the county. At {{convert|978|m|ft|0}} [[Scafell Pike]] is the highest point in Cumbria and in England. [[Windermere]] is the largest natural lake in England.

The [[Lancaster Canal]] runs from Preston into South Cumbria and is partly in use.  The [[Ulverston Canal]] which once reached to [[Morecambe Bay]] is maintained although it was closed in 1945.

===Boundaries and divisions===
Cumbria is bordered by the English counties of [[Northumberland]], [[County Durham]], [[North Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]], and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] council areas of [[Dumfries and Galloway]] and [[Scottish Borders]].

The boundaries are along the [[Irish Sea]] to [[Morecambe Bay]] in the west, and along the [[Pennines]] to the east. Cumbria's northern boundary stretches from the [[Solway Firth]] from the [[Solway Plain]] eastward along the border with [[Scotland]] to [[Northumberland]].

It is made up of six [[Districts of England|districts]]: [[Allerdale]], [[Barrow-in-Furness (borough)|Barrow-in-Furness]], [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], [[Copeland, Cumbria|Copeland]], [[Eden, Cumbria|Eden]] and [[South Lakeland]]. For many administrative purposes Cumbria is divided into three areas&nbsp;— East, West and South. East consists of the districts of Carlisle and Eden, West&nbsp;consists of Allerdale and Copeland, and South consists of Lakeland and Barrow.

In January 2007, Cumbria County Council voted in favour of an official bid to scrap the current two-tier system of county and district councils in favour of a new [[Unitary authority|unitary]] Cumbria Council, to be submitted for consideration to the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cumbria.gov.uk/news/Archive/2007/january/18_01_2007-131242.asp |title=County council votes to pursue a single council for Cumbria|accessdate =24 February 2007}}</ref> This was then rejected.

The county returns six Members of Parliament to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], representing the constituencies of [[Carlisle (UK Parliament constituency)|Carlisle]], [[Penrith and The Border (UK Parliament constituency)|Penrith & The Border]], [[Workington (UK Parliament constituency)|Workington]], [[Copeland (UK Parliament constituency)|Copeland]], [[Westmorland and Lonsdale]] and [[Barrow and Furness (UK Parliament constituency)|Barrow & Furness]].

The largest and most widespread industry in Cumbria is tourism. The [[Lake District National Park]] alone receives some 15.8&nbsp;million visitors every year.<ref name=LakeDistrictstats>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/factsandfigures|title=Lake District National Park|publisher=Lake District National Park|accessdate=16 July 2010}}</ref> Despite this, fewer than 50,000 people reside permanently within the Lake District – mostly in [[Ambleside]], [[Bowness-on-Windermere]], [[Coniston, Cumbria|Coniston]], [[Keswick, Cumbria|Keswick]], [[Grasmere]] and [[Windermere, Cumbria (town)|Windermere]].<ref name=LakeDistrictstats/> Over 36,000 Cumbrians are employed in the tourism industry which adds £1.1&nbsp;billion a year to the county's economy. The Lake District and county as a whole attracts visitors from across the UK,<ref name=LakeDistrictstats/> Europe, North America and the Far East (particularly Japan).<ref name=LakeDistrictstats/> The tables below show the twenty most-visited attractions in Cumbria in 2009 (please note that not all visitor attractions provided data to Cumbria Tourism who collated the list. Notable examples are [[Furness Abbey]], the [[Lakes Aquarium]] and [[South Lakes Safari Zoo]], the latter of which would almost certainly rank within the top five).<ref name=LakeDistrictstats2>{{cite web|url=http://www.cumbriatourism.org/research/attractions.aspx|title=Lake District National Park|publisher=Cumbria Tourism|accessdate=16 July 2010}}</ref>

==Education==
[[File:Skiddaw Building, University of Cumbria - geograph.org.uk - 715574.jpg|thumb|right|The University of Cumbria's Fusehill Campus in Carlisle]] 
{{See also|List of schools in Cumbria}}

Although Cumbria has a comprehensive system almost ''in toto'', it has one state grammar school in Penrith. There are 42 state secondary schools and 10 independent schools. The more rural secondary schools tend to have [[sixth form]]s though in Barrow-in-Furness district no school except [[Chetwynde School]] (Independent) has a sixth form, and this is the same for three schools in Allerdale and South Lakeland, and one in the other districts. Chetwynde is also the only school in Barrow to educate children from nursery all the way to sixth form level.

Colleges of further education in Cumbria include [[Barrow-in-Furness Sixth Form College]], [[Carlisle College]], [[Cumbria Institute of the Arts]], Dallam Sixth form Centre, [[Furness College, Barrow-in-Furness|Furness College]], [[Kendal College]], [[Lakes College West Cumbria]], West Cumbria Catholic Sixth Form Centre and Workington Sixth Form College.

The [[University of Cumbria]] is one of the UK's newest universities having been established in 2007, it is at present the only university in Cumbria and has campuses across the county.

==Transport==
[[File:Lune Valley from Grayrigg Forest.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M6 motorway]] and [[West Coast Main Line]] near [[Grayrigg Forest]]]]

The [[M6 motorway|M6]] is the only motorway that runs through Cumbria. [[Kendal]] and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] are amongst its primary destinations before it terminates just north of [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]]. Major [[A roads in Great Britain|A roads]] within Cumbria include:

* [[A6 road (England)|A6]] (Luton, Bedfordshire to Carlisle via Kendal and Penrith)
* [[A66 road|A66]] (Workington to Middlesbrough, North Yorkshire via Keswick, Penrith and Brough)
* [[A69 road|A69]] (Carlisle to Newcastle upon Tyne via Brampton and Hexham)
* [[A590 road|A590]] (M6 Junction 36 to Barrow-in-Furness via Ulverston)
* [[A591 road|A591]] (Sizergh to Bothel via Kendal, Windermere, Ambleside, Grasmere and Keswick)
* [[A592 road|A592]] (M6 Junction 40 to Staveley via Penrith, Windermere and Bowness-on-Windermere)
* [[A595 road|A595]] (Carlisle to Dalton-in-Furness via Whitehaven and Workington)
* [[A596 road|A596]] (Carlisle to Workington)

Several bus companies  run services in Cumbria serving the main towns and villages in the county, with some services running to neighbouring areas such as [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]]. [[Stagecoach North West]] is the largest; it has depots in Barrow-in-Furness, Carlisle, Kendal and Workington. Stagecoach's flagship X6 route connects Barrow-in-Furness and Kendal in south Cumbria.

There are only two airports in the county: [[Carlisle Lake District Airport|Carlisle Lake District]] and [[Barrow/Walney Island Airport|Barrow/Walney Island]]. Both airports formerly served scheduled passenger flights and both are proposing expansions and renovations to handle domestic and European flights in the near future. The nearest international airports to south Cumbria are [[Blackpool International Airport|Blackpool]], [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]] and [[Liverpool Airport|Liverpool John Lennon]]. North Cumbria is closer to [[Newcastle Airport|Newcastle]], [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport|Glasgow Prestwick]] and [[Glasgow International Airport|Glasgow International]]. Barrow-in-Furness is one of the country's largest shipbuilding centres, but the [[Port of Barrow]] is only minor, it is operated by [[Associated British Ports]] alongside the Port of [[Silloth]] in Allerdale. There are no ferry links from any port or harbour along the Cumbria coast.

The busiest railway stations in Cumbria are [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]], [[Barrow-in-Furness railway station|Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Penrith railway station|Penrith]] and [[Oxenholme Lake District railway station|Oxenholme Lake District]]. The {{convert|399|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[West Coast Main Line]] runs through the Cumbria countryside adjacent to the M6 motorway. The [[Cumbrian Coast Line]] connects Barrow-in-Furness to Carlisle and is a vital link in the west of the county. Other railways in  Cumbria are the [[Windermere Branch Line]], most of the [[Furness Line]] and much of the [[Settle-Carlisle Railway]].

{{Main|Demography of Cumbria}}

Cumbria's largest settlement and only city is [[City of Carlisle|Carlisle]], in the north of the county. The largest town, [[Barrow-in-Furness]], in the south, is slightly smaller. The county's population is largely rural: it has the second lowest population density among English counties, and has only five towns with a population of over 20,000. Cumbria is also one of the country's most ethnically homogeneous counties, with 95.1% of the population categorised as [[White British]] (around 470,900 of the 495,000 Cumbrians).<ref name="2009ethnicity">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/lad-tables-2009.xls|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810102910/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/lad-tables-2009.xls|archivedate=10 August 2011| title=Current Estimates – Population Estimates by Ethnic Group Mid-2009 (experimental) | publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] | accessdate=20 May 2011}}</ref> However, the larger towns have ethnic makeups that are closer to the national average. The [[United Kingdom 2001 census|2001 census]] indicated that Christianity was the religion with the most adherents in the county.

2010 [[Office for National Statistics|ONS]] estimates placed the number of foreign-born (non-United Kingdom) people living in Cumbria at around 14,000 and foreign nationals at 6,000.<ref name="2010 estimates">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/population-by-birthcountrynationality-apr09-mar10.zip|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185605/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/downloads/theme_population/population-by-birthcountrynationality-apr09-mar10.zip|archivedate=29 June 2011| title=Table 1.3: Estimated population resident in the United Kingdom, by foreign country of birth, April 2009 to March 2010| publisher=Office for National Statistics | accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref> The [[2001 UK Census]] showed the following most common countries of birth for Cumbrians that year:

==Symbols and county emblems==
The arms of Cumbria County Council were granted by the [[College of Arms]] on 10 October 1974. The arms represent the areas from which the new county council's area was put together; the shield's green border has Parnassus flowers representing Cumberland interspersed with roses; red for Lancashire (the Furness district) on white for Yorkshire (Sedbergh is from the [[West Riding of Yorkshire|West Riding]]). The crest is a ram's head crest, found in the arms both of Westmorland County Council and Barrow County Borough, with Cumberland's Parnassus flowers again. The supporters are the legendary Dacre Bull (Cumberland) and a red dragon ([[Appleby in Westmorland]]). They stand on a base compartment representing Hadrian's Wall (in Cumberland), crossed with two red bars (from the Westmorland arms).<ref name=Civis>[http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/cumbria_palatine_counties.html ''Cumbria County Council''] (Civic Heraldry) accessed 24 January 2010</ref>

The county council motto "Ad Montes Oculos Levavi" is [[Latin language|Latin]], from Psalm 121; ("I shall lift up mine eyes unto the hills").<ref name=Civis/>

The county flag of Cumbria is a [[heraldic flag|banner of arms]] of Cumbria County Council.<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cumbria-floods-remembered-at-department-for-communities-and-local-government Cumbria floods remembered at Department for Communities and Local Government - News stories - GOV.UK<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web|year=2010|title=Cumbria flag flying outside Eland House|publisher=Department for Communities and Local Government|url=https://secure.flickr.com/photos/communitiesuk/5181436248/|accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref>

===Football===
[[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] are the only professional football team in Cumbria and currently play in League Two (4th Tier in the English football pyramid). They attract support from across Cumbria and beyond, with many Cumbrian "ex-pats" travelling to see their games, both home and away.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Home attendances are usually 3,000 to 4,000 and the away support is often 1,000 to 2,000. This is one of the highest proportions of away-home support in England.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

[[Barrow A.F.C.|Barrow]] and [[Workington A.F.C]]—who are always known locally as "the reds"—are well-supported non-league teams,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} having both been relegated from the Football League in the 1970s, with Barrow being one of the best supported [[non-league]] football teams in England. Recently [[Workington A.F.C]] have made a rapid rise up the non league ladder and in 2007/08 competed with Barrow in the Conference North (Tier 6). Barrow were then promoted to the Blue Square Premier (Tier 5) in 2007/08.

===Rugby league===
[[Rugby league]] is a very popular sport in South and West Cumbria. [[Barrow Raiders|Barrow]], [[Whitehaven RLFC|Whitehaven]] and [[Workington Town|Workington]] play in the [[Rugby League National Leagues]] and [[Carlisle Centurions|Carlisle]] in the [[Rugby League Conference]]. [[British Amateur Rugby League Association|Amateur]] teams; Wath Brow Hornets, [[Askam and Ireleth#Sport|Askam]], [[Egremont Rangers ARLFC|Egremont Rangers]] and [[Millom RLFC|Millom]] play in the [[National Conference League|National Conference]].

===Rugby union===

[[Rugby union]] is popular in the east of the county with teams such as Furness RUFC & Hawcoat Park RUFC (South Cumbria), Workington RUFC (West Cumbria), Carlisle RUFC, [[Aspatria RUFC]], Wigton RUFC, [[Kendal Rugby Union Football Club|Kendal RUFC]], Kirkby Lonsdale RUFC, Keswick RUFC, Cockermouth RUFC, Upper Eden RUFC and [[Penrith RUFC]].

===Cricket===
[[Cumberland County Cricket Club]] is one of the [[cricket]] clubs that constitute the [[Minor counties of English cricket|Minor Counties]] in the English domestic cricket structure. The club, based in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], competes in the [[Minor Counties Championship]] and the [[MCCA Knockout Trophy]]. The club also play some home matches in [[Workington]], as well as other locations.

Cumbrian [[club cricket]] teams play in the [[North Lancashire and Cumbria League]].

'''Wrestling'''<br>
{{Main|Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling}}

Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling is an ancient and well-practised tradition in the county with a strong resemblance to [[Scottish Backhold]].

In the 21st century Cumberland and Westmorland wrestling along with other aspects of Lakeland culture are practised at the Grasmere Sports and Show, an annual meeting held every year since 1852 on the August [[Bank Holiday]].

The origin of this form of wrestling is a matter of debate, with some describing it as having evolved from Norse wrestling brought over by Viking invaders,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ejmas.com/kronos/NewHist1700-1859.htm| title=Kronos; A Chronology of the Martial Arts and Combative Sports|accessdate=24 February 2007}}</ref> while other historians associate it with the [[Cornish Wrestling|Cornish]] and [[Gouren]] styles<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sportsvl.com/rest/wrestling/wrestling.htm#Celtic| title=Amateur Wrestling| accessdate=24 February 2007}}</ref> indicating that it may have developed out of a longer-standing Celtic tradition.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ejmas.com/kronos/NewHist0500-1349.htm| title=Kronos; A Chronology of the Martial Arts and Combative Sports| accessdate=24 February 2007}}</ref>

'''American Football'''<br>
Cumbria is home to the [[Walney Terriers]] and the [[Carlisle Border Reivers]], which are rival amateur American Football teams, despite a relatively low level of interest in the sport throughout the county.

'''Karting'''<br>
Cumbria Kart Racing Club is based at the Lakeland Circuit, [[Rowrah]], between [[Cockermouth]] and [[Egremont, Cumbria|Egremont]] [http://www.cumbriakrc.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=43&Itemid=48]. The track is currently a venue for rounds of both major UK national karting championships [http://www.cumbriakrc.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=19]. [[Formula One]] world champions [[Lewis Hamilton]] and [[Jenson Button]] both raced karts at Rowrah many times in the formative stages of their motor sport careers [http://www.cumbriakrc.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=19], while other F1 drivers, past and present, to have competed there include [[Johnny Herbert]], [[Anthony Davidson]], [[Allan McNish]], [[Ralph Firman]], [[Paul di Resta]] and [[David Coulthard]], who hailed from just over the nearby Anglo-Scottish border and regarded Rowrah as his home circuit, becoming Cumbria Kart Racing Club Champion in 1985 in succession to McNish (di Resta also taking the CKRC title subsequently) [http://www.egremont-today.com/812rowrah.htm].

==Media==
Two evening newspapers are published daily in Cumbria. The ''[[News and Star]]'' focuses largely on Carlisle and the surrounding areas of north and west Cumbria, and the ''[[North-West Evening Mail]]'' is based in Barrow-in-Furness and covers news from across Furness and the South Lakes. The ''[[Cumberland and Westmorland Herald]]'' and ''[[The Westmorland Gazette]]'' are weekly newspapers based in Penrith and Kendal respectively.

Due to the size of Cumbria the county spans two television zones: [[BBC North East and Cumbria]] and [[ITV Tyne Tees & Border]] in the north and [[BBC North West]] and [[ITV Granada]] in the south. [[The Bay (radio station)|The Bay]], [[CFM Radio]] and [[Lakeland Radio]] are the most popular local radio stations throughout the county, with [[BBC Radio Cumbria]] being the only station that is aimed at Cumbria as a whole.

Guillermo del Toro's Crimson Peak (2015) is probably set in Cumbria.  In one scene, the protagonist discovers the motto "Ad montes oculos levavi" over the fireplace of her manor.
