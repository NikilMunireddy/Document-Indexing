'''Acoustic music''' is music that solely or primarily uses [[Musical instrument|instruments]] that produce sound through [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] means, as opposed to [[Electric instrument|electric]] or [[Electronic music|electronic]] means. The [[retronym]] "acoustic music" appeared after the advent of electric instruments, such as the [[electric guitar]], [[electric violin]], [[Electronic organ|electric organ]] and  [[synthesizer]].{{sfn|Safire|2007}}

Performers of acoustic music often increase the volume of their output using [[electronic amplifier]]s. However, these amplification devices remain separate from the amplified instrument and reproduce its natural sound accurately. Often a microphone is placed in front of an acoustic instrument which is then wired up to an amplifier.{{Clarify|date=February 2016}}<!--Is this meant to explain how acoustic music may actually beelectric, or the other way around?-->

It has its origins in the folk music of the 1960s.{{sfn|Jermance|2003|p=16}} Following the increasing popularity of the television show ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' during the 1990s, acoustic (though in most cases still electrically amplified) performances by [[musician]]s (most notably [[grunge]] bands) who usually rely on electronic instruments became colloquially referred to as "unplugged" performances. The trend has also been dubbed as "acoustic rock" in some cases.{{sfn|Ilic|2013|p=44}}

Writing for ''Splendid'', music reviewer Craig Conley suggests, "When music is labeled acoustic, unplugged, or unwired, the assumption seems to be that other types of music are ''cluttered'' by [[Audio technology|technology]] and [[Overproduction (music)|overproduction]] and therefore aren't as ''pure''".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.splendidezine.com/reviews/aug-16-99/unwired.html|title= Review: ''Unwired: Acoustic Music from around the World''|accessdate=November 17, 2008|last= Conley| first = Craig|date= August 16, 1999|publisher = ''Splendid''| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081225091421/http://www.splendidezine.com/reviews/aug-16-99/unwired.html| archivedate= 25 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
