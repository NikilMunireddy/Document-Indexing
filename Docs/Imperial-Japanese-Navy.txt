The '''Imperial Japanese Navy''' ('''IJN'''; [[Kyūjitai]]: {{lang|ja|大日本帝國海軍}} [[Shinjitai]]: {{lang|ja|大日本帝国海軍}} ''{{Audio|ja-Dai-Nippon_teikoku_kaigun.ogg|Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kaigun}}'' or {{lang|ja|日本海軍}} ''Nippon Kaigun'', literally "Navy of the Greater Japanese Empire") was the [[navy]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] from 1868 until 1945, [[Potsdam Declaration|when it was dissolved]] following [[surrender of Japan|Japan's defeat and surrender in World War II]]. It was controlled by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]] and the [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Ministry of the Navy]], both of which were nominally subordinate to the [[Emperor of Japan]] as [[commander-in-chief|supreme commander]] of the army and the navy. The [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF) was formed after the dissolution of the IJN.<ref>[[Library of Congress Country Studies]], [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/jptoc.html Japan> National Security> Self-Defense Forces> Early Development]</ref>

The Japanese Navy was the third largest navy in the world by 1920, behind the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[United States Navy]] (USN).<ref>Evans, Kaigun</ref> It was supported by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet. It was the primary opponent of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] in the [[Pacific War]].

The origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy go back to early interactions with nations on the [[Asia|Asian continent]], beginning in the early [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|medieval period]] and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of [[cultural diffusion|cultural exchange]] with [[Europe]]an [[power (international)|powers]] during the [[Age of Discovery]]. After two centuries of stagnation during the country's ensuing [[Sakoku|seclusion policy]] under the [[shogun]]s of the [[Edo period]], Japan's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by [[Convention of Kanagawa|American intervention]] in 1854. This eventually led to the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Accompanying the re-ascendance of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] came a period of frantic [[modernization]] and [[industrialization]]. The navy's history of successes, sometimes against much more powerful foes as in the [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese war]] and the [[Russo-Japanese War]], ended in almost complete annihilation during the concluding days of [[World War II]], largely by the USN.

==Origins==
{{main|Naval history of Japan}}

[[Japan]] has a long history of naval interaction with the Asian continent, involving transportation of troops between [[Korea]] and Japan, starting at least with the beginning of the [[Kofun era|Kofun period]] in the 3rd century.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FxTNBAAJaqEC&pg=PA7|title=Early Samurai|work=google.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>

Following the attempts at [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] by [[Kublai Khan|Kubilai Khan]] in 1274 and 1281, Japanese ''[[Wokou|wakō]]'' became very active in [[plunder]]ing the coast of [[History of China#The Chinese Empire|China]].{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=3}}{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=4}}

[[Image:RedSealShip.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Woodblock print of a ship in sideview with sails raised.|A 1634 Japanese [[Red seal ship]], combining eastern and western naval technologies]]

[[Japan]] undertook major naval building efforts in the 16th century, during the [[Sengoku period|Warring States period]], when feudal rulers vying for supremacy built vast coastal navies of several hundred ships. Around that time Japan may have developed one of the first [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] warships when [[Oda Nobunaga]], a [[Japan]]ese [[daimyo]], had six iron-covered [[Atakebune|Oatakebune]] made in 1576.<ref>''THE FIRST IRONCLADS'' In Japanese: [http://s-mizoe.hp.infoseek.co.jp/m160.html]. Also in English: [http://www.samurai-archives.com/mth.html]: ''"Iron clad ships, however, were not new to Japan and Hideyoshi; [[Oda Nobunaga]], in fact, had many iron clad ships in his fleet."'' (referring to the anteriority of Japanese ironclads (1578) to the Korean [[Turtle ship]]s (1592)). In Western sources, Japanese ironclads are described in CR Boxer "The Christian Century in Japan 1549–1650", p122, quoting the account of the Italian Jesuit Organtino visiting Japan in 1578. Nobunaga's ironclad fleet is also described in "A History of Japan, 1334–1615", Georges Samson, p309 ISBN 0-8047-0525-9. Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] invented Korea's "ironclad Turtle ships", first documented in 1592. Incidentally, Korea's iron plates only covered the roof (to prevent intrusion), and not the sides of their ships. The first Western ironclads date to 1859 with the French [[French ironclad Gloire|''Gloire'']] ("Steam, Steel and Shellfire").</ref> In 1588 [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] issued a ban on Wakō piracy; the pirates then became vassals of Hideyoshi, and comprised the naval force used in the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)|Japanese invasion of Korea]] (1592–1598).{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=4}}

Japan built her first large ocean-going warships in the beginning of the 17th century, following contacts with the Western nations during the [[Nanban trade period]]. In 1613, the Daimyo of [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai]], in agreement with the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] [[Shogun|Bakufu]], built [[San Juan Bautista (ship)|''Date Maru'']], a 500&nbsp;ton [[galleon]]-type ship that transported the Japanese embassy of [[Hasekura Tsunenaga]] to the Americas, which then continued to Europe.<ref>
[https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&pg=PA293 ''Japan encyclopedia'' by Louis Frédéric p.293]
</ref> From 1604 the Bakufu also commissioned about 350 [[Red seal ship]]s, usually armed and incorporating some Western technologies, mainly for [[Southeast Asia]]n trade.<ref>''Asia in the Making of Europe, Volume III'' by Donald F. Lach, Edwin J. Van Kley p.29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PjVKjJ-WgOYC&pg=PA29]</ref><ref>''The Military Revolution: Military Innovation and the Rise of the West, 1500–1800'' by Geoffrey Parker p.110 [https://books.google.com/books?id=cIFiNRH3oWsC&pg=PA110]</ref>

===Western studies and the end of Seclusion===
[[Image:ShoheiMaru.JPG|thumb|alt=Colored drawing of a three-masted warship.|[[Japanese warship Shohei Maru|''Shōhei Maru'']] (1854) was built from Dutch technical drawings.]]
For more than 200 years, beginning in the 1640s, the Japanese policy of seclusion ("''[[sakoku]]''") forbade contacts with the outside world and prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships on pain of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZ5w7Qy0W8EC&pg=PA205|title=A History of Japan|work=google.com|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref> Contacts were maintained, however, with the Dutch through the port of [[Nagasaki]], the Chinese also through Nagasaki and the Ryukyus and Korea through intermediaries with Tsushima. The study of Western sciences, called "''[[rangaku]]''" through the Dutch enclave of [[Dejima]] in Nagasaki led to the transfer of knowledge related to the Western technological and [[scientific revolution]] which allowed Japan to remain aware of naval sciences, such as [[cartography]], [[optics]] and mechanical sciences, seclusion however, led to loss of any naval and maritime traditions the nation possessed.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=4}}

Apart from Dutch trade ships no other Western vessels were allowed to enter Japanese ports, a notable exception was during the [[Napoleonic wars]], when neutral ships flew the Dutch flag. However frictions with foreign ships started from the beginning of the 19th century. [[HMS Phaeton (1782)#Nagasaki Harbour Incident|The Nagasaki incident involving the HMS ''Phaeton'' in 1808]] and other subsequent incidents in the following decades led to the Shogunate to enact an [[Edict to Repel Foreign Vessels|edict to repel foreign vessels]]. Western ships which were increasing their presence around Japan due to whaling and the trade with China began to challenge the seclusion policy.

The [[Morrison Incident]] in 1837 and news of China's defeat during the [[First Opium War|Opium War]], however, led to the Shogunate to repeal the law to execute foreigners and instead to adopt the Order for the Provision of Firewood and Water. The shogunate also began to strengthen the nation's coastal defenses. Many Japanese realized that traditional ways would not be sufficient to repel further intrusions and western knowledge was utilized through the Dutch at Dejima to reinforce Japan's capability to repel the foreigners; field guns, mortars and firearms were obtained and coastal defenses reinforced. [[Sakoku#Challenges to seclusion|Numerous attempts to open Japan]] ended in failure in part to Japanese resistance, this was until the early 1850s.

During 1853 and 1854, [[United States Navy|American]] warships under the command of [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Commodore Matthew Perry]] entered [[Tokyo Bay|Edo Bay]] and made demonstrations of force requesting trade negotiations. After two hundred years of seclusion the 1854 [[Convention of Kanagawa]] led to the [[opening of Japan]] to international trade and interaction. This was soon followed by the 1858 [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States–Japan)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] and [[Unequal Treaties|treaties with other powers]].

===Development of Shogunal and Domain naval forces===

As soon as Japan opened up to foreign influences, the Tokugawa shogunate recognized the vulnerability of the country from the sea and initiated an active policy of assimilation and adoption of Western naval technologies.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=5}} In 1855, with Dutch assistance, the Shogunate acquired its first steam warship, ''Kankō Maru'', and began using it for training, establishing a [[Nagasaki Naval Training Center|Naval Training Center]] at Nagasaki.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=5}}

[[Samurai]] such as the future Admiral [[Enomoto Takeaki]] (1836-1908) were sent by the Shogunate to study in the [[Netherlands]] for several years.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=5}} In 1859 the Naval Training Center relocated to [[Tsukiji]] in [[Tokyo]]. In 1857 the Shogunate acquired its first screw-driven steam warship {{Ship|Japanese warship|Kanrin Maru||2}} and used it as an escort for the [[Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860)|1860 Japanese delegation to the United States]]. In 1865 the French naval engineer [[Léonce Verny]] was hired to build Japan's first modern naval arsenals, at [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]].{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=246}} In 1867–1868 a British Naval mission headed by [[Tracey Mission|Commander Richard Tracey]]<ref name="globalsecurity.org">{{cite web|url= http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn-rise.htm|title= Rise of the Imperial Japanese Navy|author= John Pike|work= globalsecurity.org|accessdate= 1 April 2015}}</ref> went to Japan to assist the development of the Japanese Navy and to organize the naval school of Tsukiji.<ref>Described in "Soie et Lumiere", in a parallel to the [[French military mission to Japan (1867–68)]] for the Army.</ref>

The Shogunate also allowed and then ordered various [[Han system|domain]]s to purchase warships and to develop naval fleets,{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=15}} [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]], especially, had petitioned the Shogunate to build modern naval vessels.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=5}} A naval center had been set up by the Satsuma domain in Kagoshima, students were sent abroad for training and a number of ships were acquired.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=5}} The domains of [[Choshu Domain|Choshu]], [[Hizen Province|Hizen]], [[Tosa Domain|Tosa]] and [[Kaga Domain|Kaga]] joined Satsuma in acquiring ships.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=15}} This was not enough to prevent the [[Bombardment of Kagoshima|British from bombarding Kagoshima]] in 1863 or the [[Shimonoseki Campaign|Allied bombardments of Shimonoseki]] in 1863–64.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=5}}

By the mid 1860s the Shogunate had a fleet of eight warships and thirty-six auxiliaries.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=15}} Satsuma (which had the largest domain fleet) had nine steamships,{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=16}} Choshu had five ships plus numerous auxiliary craft, Kaga had ten ships and Chikuzen eight.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=16}} Numerous smaller domains also had acquired a number of ships. However these fleets resembled maritime organizations rather than actual navies with ships functioning as transports as well as combat vessels,{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=5}} they were also manned by personnel who lacked experienced seamanship except for coastal sailing and who had virtually no combat training.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=5}}

==Creation of the Imperial Japanese Navy (1868–72)==
[[Image:Japanese Ironclad warship Ryujo.jpg|thumb|alt=Three-masted warship at anchor in a bay.|The British-built {{ship|Japanese ironclad|Ryūjō||2}} was the flagship of the Imperial Japanese Navy until 1881.]]
The [[Meiji restoration]] in 1868 led to the overthrow of the Shogunate. From 1868, the newly formed [[Dajokan|Meiji government]] continued with reforms to centralize and modernize Japan.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=13}}

===Boshin war===
[[Image:Naval Battle of Hakodate.jpg|thumb|299px|Naval battle of Hakodate.]]
Although the Tokugawa shogunate had been overthrown, tensions between the former ruler and the restoration leaders led to the [[Boshin war]]. The early part of the conflict largely involved land battles with naval forces playing a minimal role transporting troops from western to eastern Japan.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=11}} Only the [[Battle of Awa]] was significant, this was also one of the few Tokugawa successes of the war. The Tokugawa Yoshinobu eventually surrendered after the fall of Edo and as a result most of Japan accepted the emperor's rule, however resistance continued [[Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei|in the North]].

On 26 March 1868, the first naval review in Japan was held in [[Osaka Bay]], with six ships from the private domain navies of [[Saga Domain|Saga]], [[Chōshū Domain|Chōshū]], [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]], [[Kurume Domain|Kurume]], [[Kumamoto Domain|Kumamoto]] and [[Hiroshima Domain|Hiroshima]] participating. The total tonnage of these ships was 2,252&nbsp;tons, which was far smaller than the tonnage of the single foreign vessel (from the French Navy) that also participated. The following year, in July 1869, the Imperial Japanese Navy was formally established, two months after the last combat of the [[Boshin War]].

[[Enomoto Takeaki]], admiral of the Shogun's navy, also refused to surrender all his ships, remitting just four ships, and escaped to northern Honshū with the remnants of the Shogun's Navy, which were eight steam warships and 2,000 men. Following defeat of resistance on Honshū, Enomoto Takeaki later fled to Hokkaidō where he established the breakaway Republic of Ezo. A military force was dispatched by the new government to defeat the rebels culminated with the [[Naval Battle of Hakodate]] in 1869.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=7}}  The French-built ironclad ''Kotetsu'', originally ordered by the Tokugawa shogunate, was received by the Imperial side and was used decisively towards the end of the conflict.{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=100}}

===Consolidation===
In February 1868 the government had placed all captured Shogunate naval vessels under the Navy Army affairs section.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=11}} In the following months, military forces of the government were put under several organizations which were created and then disbanded until the creation of the establishment of [[Ministry of the Military|Ministry of Military Affairs]] (Hyōbushō). For the first two years of the Meiji state no national, centrally controlled navy existed,{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=12}} the Meiji government only administered those Tokugawa vessels captured from the early phase of the Boshin war.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=12}} All other naval vessels remained under the control of the various domains which had been acquired during the [[bakumatsu]] period. The naval forces mirrored that of the political environment of Japan at the time in which the domains retained their political as well as military independence from the imperial government. [[Katsu Kaishu]] a former Tokugawa navy leader was brought into the government because of his naval experience and his ability to control Tokugawa personnel who retained positions in the government naval forces. Upon assuming office Katsu Kaishu recommended the rapid centralization of all naval forces government and domain under one agency.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=12}} However, the nascent Meiji government at the time did not have the necessary political and military force to implement it and so like much of the government the naval forces retained a decentralized structure in most of 1869 through 1870.

The incident involving Enomoto Takeakis' refusal to surrender and his escape to Hokkaidō with a large part of former Tokugawa Navy's best warships embarrassed the Meiji government politically. The imperial side had to rely on considerable naval assistance from the most powerful domains as the government did not have enough naval power to put down the rebellion on its own.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=12}} Although the rebel forces in Hokkaidō surrendered, the government's response to the rebellion demonstrated the need for a strong centralized naval force.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=13}} Even before the rebellion the restoration leaders had realized the need for greater political, economic and military centralization and by August 1869 most of the domains had returned their lands and population registers to the government.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=13}} In 1871 the domains were abolished altogether and as with the political context the centralization of the navy began with the domains donating their forces to the central government.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=13}} As a result, in 1871 Japan could finally boast a centrally controlled navy, this was also the institutional beginning of the Imperial Japanese Navy.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=13}}

In February 1872, the Ministry of Military Affairs was replaced by a separate Army Ministry and Navy Ministry. In October 1873, [[Katsu Kaishu]] became Navy Minister.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=9}}

==Secondary Service (1872–1880)==
In 1870, the new government drafted an ambitious plan to create a navy with 200 ships organized into ten fleets. It was abandoned within a year due to lack of resources.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=7}} Financial considerations was also a major factor which  restricted the growth of the navy during the 1870s.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=19}} Japan at the time was not a wealthy state. Soon, however domestic rebellions, the [[Saga Rebellion]] (1874) and especially the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] (1877), forced the government to focus on land warfare and the army gained prominence.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=7}} Naval policy, expressed by the slogan ''Shusei Kokubō'' (lit. "Static Defense"), focused on coastal defenses,{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=7}} and a standing army (established with the assistance of the second [[French Military Mission to Japan (1872-1880)|French Military Mission to Japan]]), and a coastal navy, leading to a military organization under the ''Rikushu Kaijū'' (Army first, Navy second) principle.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=7}} The army gained the bulk of the military expenditures.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=18}}

===British support and Influence===
[[Image:RyujoAndHorse.jpg|thumb|alt=Group of men on the deck of a ship.|Naval gunnery trainees on the [[Jho Sho Maru|''Ryūjō'']], around their English instructor, Lieutenant Horse, in early 1871.]]

During the 1870s and 1880s, the Imperial Japanese Navy remained an essentially coastal defense force, although the Meiji government continued to modernize it. ''[[Jho Sho Maru]]'' (soon renamed ''Ryūjō Maru'') commissioned by [[Thomas Blake Glover|Thomas Glover]] was launched at [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] on 27 March 1869. In 1870, an Imperial decree determined that [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Royal Navy]] should be the model for development, instead of the [[Netherlands]].{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=12}}

From September 1870, the English Lieutenant Horse, a former gunnery instructor for the [[Saga Prefecture|Saga fief]] during the [[Bakumatsu]] period, was put in charge of gunnery practice on board the ''Ryūjō''. In 1871, the ministry resolved to send 16 trainees abroad for training in naval sciences (14 to Great Britain, two to the United States), among which was Heihachirō Tōgō. A 34-member British naval mission visited Japan in 1873 for two years, headed by [[Commander]] [[Archibald Lucius Douglas|Archibald Douglas]]. Later, Commander [[L.P. Willan]] was hired in 1879 to train naval cadets.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=12}}

===First interventions abroad (Taiwan 1874, Korea 1875–76)===

During 1873, a plan to invade the [[Korean peninsula]], the ''[[Seikanron]]'' proposal made by [[Saigo Takamori]], was narrowly abandoned by decision of the central government in Tokyo.<ref name="Kornicki">''Meiji Japan: Political, Economic and Social History 1868-1912'' Peter F. Kornicki p.191 [https://books.google.com/books?id=gxItA6-7RwIC&pg=PA191]</ref> In 1874, the [[Taiwan Expedition of 1874|Taiwan expedition]] was the first foray abroad of the new Imperial Japanese Navy and  [[Imperial Japanese Army|Army]] after the [[Mudan Incident of 1871]], however the navy served largely as a transport force.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=18}}

Various interventions in the Korean peninsula continued in 1875–1876, starting with the [[Ganghwa Island incident]] provoked by the Japanese gunboat {{ship|Japanese gunboat|Un'yō||2}}, leading to the dispatch of a large force of the Imperial Japanese Navy. As a result, the [[Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876]] was signed, marking the official opening of Korea to foreign trade, and Japan's first example of Western-style interventionism and adoption of "unequal treaties" tactics.<ref>''The land of scholars: two thousand years of Korean Confucianism'' by Jae-un Kang, Jae-eun Kang p.450''ff'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=XB4UYXNQK1wC&pg=PA450]</ref>

In 1878, the Japanese cruiser ''Seiki'' sailed to Europe with an entirely Japanese crew.<ref name="globalsecurity.org"/>

==Naval expansion (1880–1893)==

===Further modernization (1870s)===
Ships such as the {{ship|Japanese ironclad|Fusō||2}}, {{ship|Japanese ironclad|Kongō||2}} and {{ship|Japanese ironclad|Hiei|1877|2}} were built in British shipyards specifically for the Imperial Japanese Navy.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=19}}{{sfn|Sondhaus|2001|p=133}} Private construction companies such as [[Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries|Ishikawajima]] and [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.|Kawasaki]] also emerged around this time.

[[Image:Kongo(1878).jpg|thumb|alt=Three-masted armoured warship.|Armoured [[corvette]] {{ship|Japanese ironclad|Kongō||2}}.]]

In 1883, two large warships were ordered from British shipyards. The {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Naniwa||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Takachiho||2}} were 3,650&nbsp;ton ships. They were capable of speeds up to {{convert|18|kn|km/h mph|abbr=on}} and were armed with {{convert|54|to|76|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} deck armor and two {{convert|260|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[Krupp]] guns. The naval architect Sasō Sachū designed these on the line of the Elswick class of [[protected cruisers]] but with superior specifications.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}} An [[arms race]] was taking place with [[China]] however, who equipped herself with two 7,335&nbsp;ton German-built [[battleship]]s ([[Chinese turret ship Dingyuan|''Ting Yüan'']] and [[Chinese turret ship Zhenyuan|''Chen-Yüan'']]). Unable to confront the Chinese fleet with only two modern cruisers, Japan resorted to French assistance to build a large, modern fleet which could prevail in the upcoming conflict.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}}

===Influence of the French "Jeune École" (1880s)===
[[Image:Matsushima(Bertin).jpg|thumb|alt=Drawing of a large warship seen from the prow, racing forward through the sea.|The French-built ''Matsushima'', flagship of the Imperial Japanese Navy at the [[Battle of the Yalu River (1894)]]]]

During the 1880s, France took the lead in influence, due to its "[[Jeune École]]" ("young school") doctrine, favoring small, fast warships, especially [[Cruiser (warship)|cruiser]]s and  [[torpedo boat]]s, against bigger units.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}} The choice of France may also have been influenced by the Minister of the Navy, who happened to be [[Enomoto Takeaki]] at that time (Navy Minister 1880–1885), a former ally of the French during the Boshin War. Also, Japan was uneasy with being dependent on Great Britain, at a time when Great Britain was very close to China.{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=250}}

The ''Meiji'' government issued its First Naval Expansion bill in 1882, requiring the construction of 48 warships, of which 22 were to be torpedo boats.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}} The naval successes of the [[French Navy]] against China in the [[Sino-French War]] of 1883–85 seemed to validate the potential of torpedo boats, an approach which was also attractive to the limited resources of Japan.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}} In 1885, the new Navy slogan became ''Kaikoku Nippon'' (Jp:海国日本, lit. "Maritime Japan").{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=19}}

In 1885, the leading French Navy engineer [[Louis-Emile Bertin|Emile Bertin]] was hired for four years to reinforce the Japanese Navy and to direct the construction of the arsenals of [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] and [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]].{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}} He developed the ''[[Three Views of Japan|Sankei]]kan'' class of cruisers; three units featuring a single powerful main gun, the {{convert|320|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[Canet gun]].{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}} Altogether, Bertin supervised the building of more than 20 units. They helped establish the first true modern naval force of Japan. It allowed Japan to achieve mastery in the building of large units, since some of the ships were imported, and some others were built domestically at the arsenal of [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]]:

* 3 cruisers: the 4,700&nbsp;ton {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Matsushima||2}} and {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Itsukushima||2}}, built in France, and the {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Hashidate||2}}, built at Yokosuka.{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=250}}
* 3 coastal warships of 4,278&nbsp;tons.
* 2 small cruisers: the {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Chiyoda||2}}, a small cruiser of 2,439&nbsp;tons built in Britain, and the {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yaeyama||2}}, 1,800&nbsp;tons, built at Yokosuka.
* 1 [[frigate]], the 1,600&nbsp;ton {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Takao|1888|2}}, built at Yokosuka.<ref>''Rulers, guns, and money: the global arms trade in the age of imperialism'' by Jonathan A. Grant p.137 [https://books.google.com/books?id=l03qgaNVU3oC&pg=PA137]</ref>
* 1 [[aviso]]: the 726&nbsp;ton {{ship|Japanese cruiser|Chishima||2}}, built in France.
* 16 torpedo boats of 54&nbsp;tons each, built in France by the [[Companie du Creusot]] in 1888, and assembled in Japan.{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=250}}

This period also allowed Japan "to embrace the revolutionary new technologies embodied in [[torpedo]]es, torpedo-boats and [[Naval mine|mines]], of which the French at the time were probably the world's best exponents".<ref>Howe, p.281</ref> Japan acquired its first torpedoes in 1884, and established a "Torpedo Training Center" at Yokosuka in 1886.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}}

These ships, ordered during the fiscal years 1885 and 1886, were the last major orders placed with France. The unexplained sinking of {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Unebi||2}} ''en route'' from France to Japan in December 1886, created embarrassment however.{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=250}}{{sfn|Sims|1998|p=354}}

===British shipbuilding===
[[Image:Kotaka.jpg|thumb|alt=Small warship seen from the side.|The torpedo boat {{Ship|Japanese torpedo boat|Kotaka||2}} (1887)]]

Japan turned again to Britain, with the order of a revolutionary torpedo boat, {{Ship|Japanese torpedo boat|Kotaka||2}} which was considered the first effective design of a destroyer,{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}} in 1887 and with the purchase of {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Yoshino||2}}, built at the [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] works in [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], the fastest cruiser in the world at the time of her launch in 1892.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=14}} In 1889, she ordered the [[River Clyde|Clyde-built]] {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Chiyoda||2}}, which defined the type for [[armored cruiser]]s.<ref name="milanovich">''Chiyoda (II): First Armoured Cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy'', Kathrin Milanovich, Warship 2006, Conway Maritime Press, 2006, ISBN 9781844860302</ref>

Between 1882 and 1918, ending with the visit of the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1918-1919)|French Military Mission to Japan]], the Imperial Japanese Navy stopped relying on foreign instructors altogether. In 1886, she manufactured her own [[brown powder|prismatic powder]], and in 1892 one of her officers invented a powerful explosive, the [[Shimose powder]].<ref name="globalsecurity.org"/>

==Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895)==
{{main|First Sino-Japanese War}}
[[Image:Naval battle.ogg|thumb|left|alt=Smoke rising above the horizon at sea.|Video footage of a naval battle during the first Sino-Japanese war<ref>Video footage of the Sino-Japanese war: [http://www2.open.ed.jp/real/15655/01.mp2 Video (external link)].</ref>]]
Japan continued the modernization of its navy, especially as China was also building a powerful modern fleet with foreign, especially German, assistance, and as a result tensions were building between the two countries over [[Korea]]. The [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese war]] was officially declared on 1 August 1894, though some naval fighting had already taken place.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=41}} A Japanese squadron had intercepted and defeated a Chinese force [[Battle of Pungdo|near Korea]] weeks before.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=40}}

The Japanese Navy devastated Qing's [[Beiyang Fleet]] off the mouth of the [[Yalu River]] during the [[Battle of Yalu River (1894)|Battle of Yalu River]] on 17 September 1894, in which the Chinese fleet lost eight out of 12 warships.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=46}}  Although Japan turned out victorious, the two large German-made battleships of the Chinese Navy remained almost impervious to Japanese guns, highlighting the need for bigger capital ships in the Japanese Navy ([[Chinese turret ship Dingyuan|''Ting Yuan'']] was finally sunk by torpedoes, and [[Chinese turret ship Zhenyuan|''Chen Yuan'']] was captured with little damage). The next step of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion would thus involve a combination of heavily armed large warships, with smaller and innovative offensive units permitting aggressive tactics.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=48}}

As a result of the conflict, under the [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] (April 17, 1895), [[Taiwan]] and the [[Pescadores Islands]] were transferred to Japan.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=83}} The Imperial Japanese Navy took possession of the island and quelled opposition movements between March to October 1895, and the islands continued to be a Japanese colony until 1945. Japan also obtained the [[Liaodong Peninsula]], although she was forced by Russia, Germany and France to return it to China ([[Triple Intervention]]), only to see Russia take possession of it soon after.

==Suppression of the Boxer rebellion (1900)==
[[Image:BoxerJapaneseMarines.jpg|thumb|alt=Group of Japanese marines.|Japanese [[Special Naval Landing Force|marines]] serving under British commander [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Edward Seymour]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].]]
{{main|Boxer rebellion}}

The Imperial Japanese Navy further intervened in China in 1900, by participating together with Western Powers to the suppression of the Chinese [[Boxer Rebellion]]. The Navy supplied the largest number of warships (18 out of a total of 50), and delivered the largest contingent of troops among the intervening nations (20,840 Imperial Japanese Army and Navy soldiers, out of a total of 54,000).<ref>''Ground warfare: an international encyclopedia'' by Stanley Sandler p.117 [https://books.google.com/books?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&pg=PA117]</ref><ref>''The arc of Japan's economic development'' by Arthur J. Alexander
p.44 [https://books.google.com/books?id=KptffphJHPIC&pg=PT56]</ref>

The conflict allowed Japan to enter combat together with Western nations, and to acquire first hand understanding of their fighting methods.

==Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905)==
Following the Sino-Japanese War, and the humiliation of the forced return of the [[Liaodong Peninsula|Liaotung peninsula]] to [[China]] under [[Russia]]n pressure (the "[[Triple Intervention]]"), [[Japan]] began to build up its military strength in preparation for further confrontations.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=87}}
Japan promulgated a ¥215 million 10-year naval build-up program,{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=85}} under the slogan "Perseverance and determination" ({{lang|zh|臥薪嘗胆}}, Gashinshōtan), in which the Japanese commissioned 109 warships, for a total of 200,000&nbsp;tons, and increased its Navy personnel from 15,100 to 40,800.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=53}} The new fleet consisted of:{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=52}}

* 6 [[battleship]]s (all British-built)
* 8 [[armored cruiser]]s (4 British-, 2 Italian-, 1 German-built [[Japanese cruiser Yakumo|''Yakumo'']], and 1 French-built [[Japanese cruiser Azuma|''Azuma'']])
* 9 [[cruiser]]s (5 Japanese, 2 British and 2 U.S.-built)
* 24 [[destroyer]]s (16 British- and 8 Japanese-built)
* 63 [[torpedo boat]]s (26 German-, 10 British-, 17 French-, and 10 Japanese-built)

[[File:Japanese battleship Mikasa.jpg|right|thumb|alt=Large warship with smoke rising from the smokestack.|''Mikasa'', among the most powerful battleships of her time, in 1905.]]

One of these battleships, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Mikasa||2}}, among the most powerful warships afloat when completed,{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|pp=60–61}} was ordered from the [[Vickers]] shipyard in the [[United Kingdom]] at the end of 1898, for delivery to Japan in 1902. Commercial shipbuilding in Japan was exhibited by construction of the twin screw steamer ''Aki-Maru'', built for [[Nippon Yusen Kaisha]] by the [[Mitsubishi]] Dockyard & Engine Works, [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. The Imperial Japanese cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Chitose||2}} was built at the [[Union Iron Works]] in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].

These dispositions culminated with the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. At the [[Battle of Tsushima]], Admiral Togo (flag in ''Mikasa'') led the Japanese Combined Fleet into the decisive engagement of the war.<ref>Corbett ''Maritime Operations in the Russo-Japanese War'', 2:333</ref>{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=108}} The Russian fleet was almost completely annihilated: out of 38 Russian ships, 21 were sunk, seven captured, six disarmed, 4,545 Russian servicemen died and 6,106 were taken prisoner. On the other hand, the Japanese only lost 116 men and three torpedo boats.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=116}} These victories broke Russian strength in [[East Asia]], and triggered waves of mutinies in the Russian Navy at [[Sevastopol]], [[Vladivostok]] and [[Kronstadt]], peaking in June with the [[Russian battleship Potemkin|''Potemkin'' uprising]], thereby contributing to the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. The  victory at Tsushima elevated the stature of the navy.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=122}}

[[Image:Holland 1 Class Submarine in the IJN.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Submarine surfaced in a Japanese harbour.|[[John Philip Holland|''Holland 1'']]-class submarine, the first [[Imperial Japanese Navy submarines|Japanese navy submarine]], purchased during the Russo Japanese War.]]

During the Russo-Japanese war, Japan also made frantic efforts to develop and construct a fleet of submarines. Submarines had only recently become operational military engines, and were considered to be special weapons of considerable potential. Naval losses for the Japanese Navy during the war amounted to two battleships, four cruisers, one armored cruiser, seven destroyers, and at least 10 torpedo boats; the majority of them were lost due to hitting Russian mines.

The Imperial Japanese Navy acquired its first submarines in 1905 from [[Electric Boat Corporation|Electric Boat Company]], barely four years after the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] had commissioned its own first submarine, {{USS|Holland|SS-1|6}}. The ships were [[John Philip Holland|Holland]] designs and were developed under the supervision of Electric Boat's representative, [[Arthur Leopold Busch|Arthur L. Busch]]. These five submarines (known as Holland Type VII's) were shipped in kit form to Japan (October 1904) and then assembled at the Yokosuka, Kanagawa [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]], to become hulls ''No.1'' through ''5'', and became operational at the end of 1905.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=177}}

==Towards an autonomous national navy==
[[File:Japanese battleship Satsuma 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Large warship at rest on the sea.|[[Japanese battleship Satsuma|''Satsuma'']], the first ship in the world to be designed and laid down as an "[[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|all-big-gun]]" battleship]]

Japan continued in its efforts to build up a strong national naval industry. Following a strategy of "copy, improve, innovate",<ref>Howe, p.284</ref> foreign ships of various designs were usually analysed in depth, their specifications often improved on, and then were purchased in pairs so as to organize comparative testing and improvements. Over the years, the importation of whole classes of ships was progressively substituted by local assembly, and then complete local production, starting with the smallest ships, such as torpedo boats and cruisers in the 1880s, to finish with whole battleships in the early 20th century. The last major purchase was in 1913 when the [[battlecruiser]] {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kongō||2}} was purchased from the [[Vickers]] shipyard. By 1918, there was no aspect of shipbuilding technology where Japanese capabilities fell significantly below world standards.<ref>Howe, p.268</ref>

The period immediately after Tsushima also saw the IJN, under the influence of the [[navalist]] theoretician [[Satō Tetsutarō]], adopt an explicit policy of building for a potential future conflict against the [[United States Navy]]. Satō called for a battlefleet at least 70% as strong as that of the USA. In 1907, the official policy of the Navy became an '[[eight-eight fleet]]' of eight modern battleships and eight battlecruisers. However, financial constraints prevented this ideal ever becoming a reality.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|pp=150-1}}

By 1920, the Imperial Japanese Navy was the world's third largest navy and a leader in naval development:

* Following its 1897 invention by [[Guglielmo Marconi|Marconi]], the Japanese Navy was the first navy to employ [[wireless telegraphy]] in combat, at the 1905 Battle of Tsushima.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=84}}
* In 1905, it began building the battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}}, at the time the largest warship in the world by displacement, and the first ship to be designed, ordered and laid down as an "all-big-gun" battleship, about one year prior to the launching of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}. However, due to a lack of material, she was completed with a mixed battery of rifles, launched on 15 November 1906, and completed on 25 March 1910.<ref name="Jentschura p. 23">Jentschura p. 23</ref><ref>Jane's ''Battleships of the 20th Century'', p.68</ref>
* Between 1903<ref name="Jentschura p. 23"/> and 1910, Japan began to build battleships domestically. The 1906 battleship ''Satsuma'' was built in Japan with about 80% material imported from Great Britain, with the following battleship class in 1909,<ref>Jentschura p. 22</ref> the {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kawachi||2}}, being built with only 20% imported parts.

==World War I==

[[Image:Wakamiya.jpg|thumb|alt=Warship on the sea with mountainous background.|The Japanese [[seaplane carrier]] {{ship|Japanese seaplane carrier|Wakamiya||2}} conducted the world's first sea-launched air raids in September 1914.]]

Japan entered [[World War I]] on the side of the Entente, against [[Imperial Germany|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], as a consequence of the 1902 [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]].

In the [[Siege of Tsingtao]], the Japanese Navy helped seize the German colony of [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Tsingtao]]. During the siege, beginning on 5 September 1914, {{ship|Japanese seaplane carrier|Wakamiya||2}} conducted the world's first successful sea-launched air strikes. On 6 September 1914, in the very first air-sea battle in history, a Farman aircraft launched by ''Wakamiya'' attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser {{SMS|Kaiserin Elisabeth||2}} and the German gunboat ''Jaguar'' off Tsingtao.<ref>Donko, Wilhelm M.: „Österreichs Kriegsmarine in Fernost: Alle Fahrten von Schiffen der k.(u.)k.

A battle group was also sent to the central Pacific in August and September to pursue the [[German East Asiatic squadron]], which then moved into the Southern Atlantic, where it encountered British naval forces and was destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. Japan seized former German possessions in [[German New Guinea|northern Micronesia]], which remained Japanese colonies until the end of World War II, under the [[League of Nations]]' [[South Pacific Mandate]].{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=168}}

Hard pressed in Europe, where she had only a narrow margin of superiority against [[Germany]], Britain had requested, but was denied, the loan of Japan's four newest [[Kongō-class battlecruiser|''Kongō''-class]] battlecruisers ({{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kongō||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hiei||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kirishima||2}}), the first ships in the world to be equipped with {{convert|356|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} guns, and the most formidable battlecruisers in the world at the time.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=161}}

Following a further request by the British and the initiation of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany the Japanese, in March 1917, sent a special force of destroyers to the Mediterranean. This force, consisting of one armoured cruiser, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Akashi||2}} as [[flotilla leader]] and eight of the Navy's newest destroyers ({{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Ume||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kusunoki||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kaede||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Katsura||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Kashiwa||2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Matsu|1915|2}}, {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Sugi||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese destroyer|Sakaki||2}}), under Admiral Satō Kōzō, was based in [[Malta]] and efficiently protected allied shipping between [[Marseille]], [[Taranto]], and ports in [[Egypt]] until the end of the War.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=169}} In June, ''Akashi'' was replaced by {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Izumo||2}}, and four more destroyers were added (''Kashi'', ''Hinoki'', ''Momo'', and ''Yanagi''). They were later joined by the cruiser {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Nisshin||2}}. By the end of the war, the Japanese had escorted 788 allied transports. One destroyer, ''Sakaki'', was torpedoed on 11 June 1917 by a German submarine with the loss of 59 officers and men. A memorial at the Kalkara Naval Cemetery in Malta was dedicated to the 72 Japanese sailors who died in action during the Mediterranean convoy patrols.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Zammit|first1=Roseanne|title=Japanese lieutenant's son visits Japanese war dead at Kalkara cemetery|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040327/local/japanese-lieutenants-son-visits-war-dead-at-kalkara-cemetery.126734|accessdate=25 May 2015|publisher=Times of Malta|date=27 March 2004}}</ref>

In 1917, Japan exported 12 [[Arabe-class destroyer]]s to France.

In 1918, ships such as {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Azuma||2}} were assigned to [[convoy]] escort in the [[Indian Ocean]] between [[Singapore]] and the [[Suez Canal]] as part of Japan’s contribution to the war effort under the [[Anglo-Japanese alliance]].

After the conflict, the Japanese Navy received seven German submarines as spoils of war, which were brought to Japan and analysed, contributing greatly to the development of the Japanese submarine industry.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=212 & 215}}

==Interwar years==
In the [[Interwar period|years before]] [[World War II]], the IJN began to structure itself specifically to fight the United States. A long stretch of [[militarism|militaristic]] expansion and the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese war]] in 1937 had exacerbated tensions with the United States, which was seen as a rival of Japan.
[[Image:Japanese aircraft carrier Hosho cropped.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Aircraft carrier on the sea with cloudy sky in the background.|{{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hōshō||2}}, the world's first purpose built [[aircraft carrier]], completed (1922).]]

The Imperial Japanese Navy was faced, before and during World War II, with considerable challenges, probably more so than any other navy in the world.<ref>Lyon ''World War II Warships'' p. 34</ref> Japan, like Britain, was almost entirely dependent on foreign resources to supply its economy. To achieve Japan’s expansionist policies, IJN had to secure and protect distant sources of raw material (especially Southeast Asian oil and raw materials), controlled by foreign countries (Britain, France, and [[Netherlands#Naming conventions|the Netherlands]]). To achieve this goal, she had to build large warships capable of long range assault.

This was in conflict with Japan's doctrine of "decisive battle" ({{lang|ja|艦隊決戦}}, ''[[Kantai kessen]]'', which did not require long range),<ref>Peattie & Evans, ''Kaigun''.</ref> in which IJN would allow the U.S. to sail across the Pacific, using submarines to damage it, then engage the U.S. Navy in a "decisive battle area", near Japan, after inflicting such [[Attrition warfare|attrition]].<ref>Miller, Edward S. ''War Plan Orange''. Annapolis, MD: United States Naval Institute Press, 1991.</ref> This is in keeping with the theory of [[Alfred T. Mahan]], to which every major navy subscribed before [[World War II]], in which wars would be decided by engagements between opposing surface fleets<ref>Mahan, Alfred T. ''Influence of Seapower on History, 1660–1783'' (Boston: Little, Brown, n.d.).</ref> (as they had been for over 300 years). Following the dictates of Satō (who doubtless was influenced by Mahan),<ref>Peattie and Evans, ''Kaigun''</ref> it was the basis for Japan's demand for a 70% ratio (10:10:7) at the [[Washington Naval Conference]], which would give Japan superiority in the "decisive battle area", and the U.S.' insistence on a 60% ratio, which meant parity.<ref>Miller, ''op. cit.'' The United States would be able to enforce a 60% ratio thanks to reading signals from the Japanese government to her negotiators, thanks to having broken the Japanese diplomatic code. [[Herbert Yardley|Yardly]], ''American Black Chamber''.</ref> Japan, unlike other navies, clung to it even after it had been demonstrated to be obsolete.
[[Image:TogoAndFrenchAirforceMission.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Group formed by Japanese officers and French officers|Tōgō Heihachirō with members of the [[French Military Mission to Japan (1918-1919)]] in [[Gifu Prefecture]].]]

It was also in conflict with her past experience. Japan's numerical and industrial inferiority led her to seek technical superiority (fewer, but faster, more powerful ships), qualitative superiority (better training), and aggressive tactics (daring and speedy attacks overwhelming the enemy, a recipe for success in her previous conflicts), but failed to take account of any of these traits. She failed to take account of the fact her opponents in the [[Pacific War]] did not face the political and geographical constraints of her previous wars, nor did she allow for losses in ships and crews.<ref>Peattie & Evans, ''op. cit.'', and Willmott, H. P.,''The Barrier and the Javelin''. Annapolis, MD: United States Naval Institute Press, 1983.</ref>

Between the wars, Japan took the lead in many areas of warship development:
* In 1921, it launched the {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Hōshō||2}}, the first purpose-designed [[aircraft carrier]] in the world to be completed,<ref>"The Imperial Japanese Navy was a pioneer in naval aviation, having commissioned the world's first built-from-the-keel-up carrier, the ''Hōshō''." [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn.htm Source].</ref> and subsequently developed a fleet of aircraft carriers second to none.
* In keeping with its doctrine, the Imperial Navy was the first to mount {{convert|356|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} guns (in [[Japanese battleship Kongō|''Kongō'']]), {{convert|406|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} guns (in {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Nagato||2}}), and then completed the only battleships ever to mount [[18.1"/45|{{convert|460|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} gun]]s (in the [[Yamato-class battleship|''Yamato'' class]]).<ref>The British had used 18-inch guns during the First World War on the large "light" cruiser {{HMS|Furious|47|6}}, converted to an aircraft carrier during the 1920s, and also two of the eight monitors of the [[Lord Clive-class monitor|''Lord Clive'' class]], namely ''Lord Clive'' and ''General Wolfe''.</ref>
* In 1928, she launched the innovative [[Fubuki-class destroyer|''Fubuki''-class]] [[destroyer]], introducing enclosed dual {{convert|127|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} turrets capable of anti-aircraft fire. The new destroyer design was soon emulated by other navies. The ''Fubuki''s also featured the first [[torpedo tube]]s enclosed in splinterproof [[turret]]s.<ref>Fitzsimons, Bernard, ed. ''The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare'' (London: Phoebus, 1978), Volum3 10, p.1041, "''Fubuki''".</ref>
* Japan developed the {{convert|610|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} oxygen fuelled [[Type 93 torpedo]], generally recognized as the best torpedo in the world, to the end of World War II.<ref>Westwood, ''Fighting Ships''</ref>
[[Image:SempillMission.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two men standing over the interior of an airplane's cockpit.|Captain [[William Forbes-Sempill, 19th Lord Sempill|Sempill]] showing a Sparrowhawk to Admiral [[Tōgō Heihachirō]], 1921.]]
By 1921, Japan's naval expenditure reached nearly 32% of the national budget. In 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy possessed 10 battleships, 10 aircraft carriers, 38 cruisers (heavy and light), 112 destroyers, 65 submarines, and various auxiliary ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/ijn-rise.htm|title=Rise of the Imperial Japanese Navy|author=John Pike|work=globalsecurity.org|accessdate=1 April 2015}}</ref>

Japan at times continued to solicit foreign expertise in areas in which the IJN was inexperienced, such as naval aviation. In 1918, Japan invited the [[French military mission to Japan (1918–19)]], composed of 50 members and equipped with several of the newest types of airplanes to establish the fundamentals of Japanese naval aviation (the planes were several [[Salmson 2]]A2, [[Nieuport]], [[Spad XIII]], two [[Breguet XIV]], as well as [[Caquot]] [[dirigible]]s). In 1921, Japan hosted for a year and a half the [[Sempill Mission]], a group of British instructors who were able to train and advise the Imperial Japanese Navy on several new aircraft such as the [[Gloster Aircraft Company|Gloster]] [[Gloster Sparrowhawk|Sparrowhawk]], and on various techniques such as torpedo bombing and flight control.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=181 and 301}}

During the pre-war years, two schools of thought battled over whether the navy should be organized around powerful battleships, ultimately able to defeat American ones in Japanese waters, or around aircraft carriers. Neither really prevailed, and both lines of ships were developed, with the result neither solution displayed overwhelming strength over the American adversary. A consistent weakness of Japanese warship development was the tendency to incorporate too much armament, and too much engine power, in comparison to ship size (a side-effect of the Washington Treaty), leading to shortcomings in stability, protection and structural strength.<ref>Lyon ''World War II warships'' p. 35</ref>

In order to combat the numerically superior American navy, the IJN devoted large amounts of resources to creating a force superior in quality,{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=205 & 370}} the objective being of "making up for quantity by means of quality".{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=357}} <ref>Howe, p286</ref> Betting on the agile success of aggressive tactics which stemmed from Mahanian doctrine and the concept of decisive battle,{{sfn|Stille|2014|p=13}} Japan did not invest significantly in capabilities needed to protect its long shipping lines against enemy submarines,{{sfn|Stille|2014|p=371}} particularly under-investing in the vital area of [[antisubmarine warfare]] (both escort ships and [[escort carrier]]s), and in the specialized training and organization to support it.<ref>Parillo, Mark. ''Japanese Merchant Marine in World War II''. Annapolis, MD: United States Naval Institute Press, 1993.</ref> Imperial Japan's reluctance to use its [[submarine]] fleet for commerce raiding and failure to secure its communications also hastened its defeat.

During the first six months of the Pacific War, the IJN enjoyed spectacular success inflicting heavy defeats on Allied forces.{{sfn|Stille|2014|p=9}} The [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] crippled the battle line of US Pacific fleet{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=488}} while Allied navies were devastated during the conquest of Southeast Asia.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=489}} Japanese naval aircraft were also responsible for [[Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|sinkings of the ''Prince of Wales'' and ''Repulse'']] which was the first time that capital ships were sunk by aerial attack while underway.{{sfn|Peattie|2007|p=169}} In April 1942, the [[Indian Ocean raid]] drove the [[Royal Navy]] from South East Asia.{{sfn|Peattie|2007|p=172}}

After these successes, the IJN now concentrated on the elimination and neutralization of strategic points from where the Allies could launch counteroffensives against Japanese conquests.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=489}} However, at [[Battle of the Coral Sea|Coral Sea]] the Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=489}} while the defeat in the [[Battle of Midway|Midway Campaign]] saw the Japanese forced on the defensive. The [[Solomon Islands campaign|campaign in the Solomon Islands]], in which the Japanese lost the war of attrition, was the most decisive; the Japanese failed to commit enough forces in sufficient time.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|pp=490}} During 1943 the Allies were able to reorganize their forces and American industrial strength began to turn the tide of the war.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=491}} American forces ultimately managed to gain the upper hand through a vastly greater industrial output and a modernization of its air and naval forces.<ref>''The origins of Japanese trade supremacy: development and technology in Asia'' by Christopher Howe p.313'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=XkCRcv0iXn0C&pg=PA313]</ref>

In 1943, the Japanese also turned their attention to the defensive perimeters of their previous conquests. Forces on Japanese held islands in Micronesia were to absorb and wear down an expected American counteroffensive.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=491}} However, American industrial power become apparent and the military forces that faced the Japanese in 1943 were overwhelming in firepower and equipment.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=491}} From the end of 1943 to 1944 Japan's defensive perimeter failed to hold.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=491}}

Defeat at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea|Philippine Sea]] was a disaster for Japanese naval air power with American pilots terming the slanted air/sea battle the ''Great Marianas Turkey Shoot'', mostly going in the favor of the U.S.,{{sfn|Peattie|2007|p=188-189}} while the battle of [[Battle of Leyte Gulf|Leyte Gulf]] led to the destruction of a large part of the surface fleet.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=492}} During the last phase of the war, the Imperial Japanese Navy resorted to a series of desperate measures, including a variety of [[Japanese Special Attack Units|Special Attack Units]] which were popularly called ''[[kamikaze]]''.<ref name="Inoguchi">''The Divine Wind: Japan's Kamikaze Force in World War II'' Rikihei Inoguchi, Tadashi Nakajima, Roger Pineau p.150 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZUwqtaN3IYC&pg=PA150]</ref> By May 1945, most of the Imperial Japanese Navy had been sunk and the remnants had taken refuge in Japan's harbors.{{sfn|Evans|Peattie|1997|p=492}} By July 1945, all but one of the Imperial Japanese Navy capital ships had been sunk in [[Bombing of Kure (July 1945)|raids]] by the [[United States Navy]].

==Self-Defense Forces==

{{main|Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force}}
{{grammar|date=April 2016}}
Following Imperial Japan's surrender to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the conclusion of [[World War II]] and Japan's subsequent occupation, Japan's entire imperial military was dissolved in the new 1947 [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] which states, by the dense prenegotiations, due to the success in keeping the organizational continuity, reincarnation to JMSDF that new Navy organization that based on civilian control, and normative to carry out the international contribution in many parts of the world in the current it has been rounded organization of typical discipline.  Japan's current navy falls under the umbrella of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] (JSDF) as the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF).

==Personnel scale of promotions==
Prior to the Second World War, the three grades of seaman were third, second and first class. Petty officers were selected from among the first-class seamen, and were likewise graded from the third through the first classes. After a certain period, a first-class petty officer would be eligible for promotion to warrant officer. After five years of meritorious service as a warrant officer, he could be commissioned as a special-service officer in the rank of second (acting) sub-lieutenant. Such special-service officers could rise to the rank of special-service lieutenant-commander, or possibly even higher.
[[File:Ranks, Appointments & Units in the Japanese Naval Air Force.jpg|thumb|Imperial Japanese Navy ranks.]]
The majority of IJN officers were educated at and commissioned from the [[Imperial Japanese Naval Academy|Imperial Naval Academy]] at [[Etajima, Hiroshima|Etajima]]. After passing out, line officers would receive further training at the Naval College, while those in a specialised branch (engineers, paymasters and fleet medical officers) would be sent to their respective college (Engineering, Intendants School and Surgery School). Graduates of universities or higher technical schools could also receive direct commissions as special-service officers in the non-combatant branches.

The promotion of officers in the IJN was by selection, with special promotions made at the discretion of a board of admirals. In peacetime, all officers passed out from Etajima as midshipmen, after which they would serve aboard a training ship for around a year. At the end of this period, they would receive commissions as second (acting) sub-lieutenants and enter either the Torpedo or Gunnery schools. After another 18 months, six of which would be spent in either the Torpedo or Gunnery Schools, they would be promoted to sub-lieutenants and serve as junior officers aboard a ship for a prescribed time. Following this, they would enter an advanced torpedo or gunnery programme and receive promotion to lieutenant two years after their promotion to sub-lieutenant. Line-service lieutenants of over four years in the service, including enrollment in programmes at the Naval War College (or a specialised higher school for those in non-executive branches), would typically be promoted to the rank of lieutenant-commander. For special-service midshipmen, promotion to second sub-lieutenant came after two years of service and after three years for the rank of sub-lieutenant. Special-service officers could be promoted to the rank of lieutenant-commander by special appointment.

After the rank of lieutenant-commander, promotion was highly competitive and solely by selection. Promotions to the ranks of commander through rear-admiral were typically scheduled in two-year intervals, though in practice, promotions to commander were made after five years at the rank of lieutenant-commander and promotions to captain made after four years as a commander. Promotions to rear-admiral usually came after five to six years as a captain, with promotions to vice-admiral coming after three years in the rank of rear-admiral. During wartime, promotion time limits were reduced by half. In general, vice-admiral was the highest regular rank an officer could achieve in the IJN. Promotion to the rank of full admiral was by direct Imperial appointment only, and came only to vice-admirals after long service or to those recognised for special merits. The ceremonial rank of [[Gensui (Imperial Japanese Navy)|marshal-admiral]] (fleet admiral) was also only by direct Imperial appointment, more in the nature of a special award than a substantive rank.

Posthumous promotions and commissions were also common, typically coming after the officer or sailor had been killed in action or had died after a long and distinguished career.<ref>pg 114-115, "Chapter IX: National Defence: Section II: The Navy-Part 3, Personnel," The Japan-Manchukuo Year Book 1938, Japan-Manchukuo Year Book Co., Tokyo</ref>
