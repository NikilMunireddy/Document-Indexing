The '''Art Institute of Chicago''' ('''AIC''') is an encyclopedic art museum located in [[Chicago|Chicago's]] [[Grant Park (Chicago)|Grant Park]]. It features a collection of [[Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionist]] art in its permanent collection. Its holdings also include [[Visual art of the United States|American art]], [[Old Master]]s, European and American [[decorative arts]], [[Asian art]], [[Islamic art]], Ancient [[classical antiquity|classical]] and [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egyptian art]], [[Modern art|modern]] and [[contemporary art]], and [[architecture]] and industrial and graphic design. In addition, it houses the [[Ryerson & Burnham Libraries]].

Tracing its history to a free art school and gallery founded in 1866, the museum is located at 111 [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|South Michigan Avenue]] in the [[Chicago Landmark]] [[Historic Michigan Boulevard District]]. It is associated with the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] and is overseen by president and Eloise W. Martin director James Rondeau.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Steve|title=James Rondeau named new Art Institute of Chicago director|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/ct-new-art-institute-president-20160128-column.html|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=28 January 2016}}</ref> It is one of the [[List of most visited art museums in the world|most visited art museums in the world]] with about 1.5 million visitors annually (2013),  and with one million square feet in eight buildings, it is the second-[[list of largest art museums in the world|largest]] art museum in the United States, after the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].<ref name=ArtnewsApril2014>[http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/TheArtNewspaper2013_ranking.pdf Visitor Figures 2013: Museum and exhibition attendance numbers compiled and analysed], ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', International Edition, April 2014.</ref><ref name=secondlargest>{{cite news| title=A Grand and Intimate Modern Art Trove| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/14/arts/design/14inst.html?ref=design| author=Roberta Smith| date=13 May 2009| work=The New York Times| publisher=NYTimes.com| accessdate=2011-06-13}}</ref>

==History==
In 1866, a group of 35 artists founded the '''Chicago Academy of Design''' in a studio on Dearborn Street, with the intent to run a free school with its own art gallery. The organization was modeled after European art academies, such as the [[Royal Academy]], with Academians and Associate Academians. The Academy's charter was granted in March 1867.

Classes started in 1868, meeting every day at a cost of $10 per month. The Academy's success enabled it to build a new home for the school, a five-story stone building on 66 West Adams Street, which opened on November 22, 1870.

When the [[Great Chicago Fire]] destroyed the building in 1871 the Academy was thrown into debt. Attempts to continue despite the loss by using rented facilities failed. By 1878 the Academy was $10,000 in debt. Members tried to rescue the ailing institution by making deals with local businessmen, before some finally abandoned it in 1879 to found a new organization, named the [[Chicago Academy of Fine Arts]]. When the Chicago Academy of Design went bankrupt the same year, the new Chicago Academy of Fine Arts bought its assets at auction.

In 1882, the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts changed its name to the current '''Art Institute of Chicago''' and elected as its first president the banker and philanthropist [[Charles L. Hutchinson]], who "is arguably the single most important individual to have shaped the direction and fortunes of the Art Institute of Chicago"<ref name="Hilliard"/>{{rp|5}} Hutchinson was a director of many prominent Chicago organizations, including the [[University of Chicago]],<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first=|title= Few Changes Made - University of Chicago Trustees Hold an Election - Two Vacancies Filled - Other Members Whose Terms Expired Re-Elected - Examinations for Positions as Teachers in the Public Schools of the City|journal=The Daily Inter-Ocean|volume= | issue = |date=June 28, 1893|pages=1}}</ref> and would transform the Art Institute into a world-class museum during his presidency, which he held until his death in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Encyclopedia of Chicago - Art Institute of Chicago|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/79.html| author=Dillon, Diane |publisher=The Newberry Library|date= 2004-09-18| accessdate=July 24, 2015}}</ref>  Also in 1882, the organization purchased a lot on the southwest corner of [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] and Van Buren Street for $45,000. The existing commercial building on that property was used for the organization's headquarters, and a new addition was constructed behind it to provide gallery space and to house the school's facilities.<ref name="Hilliard">{{cite book | title="The Prime Mover" - Charles L.

With the announcement of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] to be held in 1892&ndash;93, the Art Institute pressed for a building on the lakefront to be constructed for the fair, but to be used by the Institute afterwards. The city agreed, and the building was completed in time for the second year of the fair. Construction costs were met by selling the Michigan/Van Buren property. On October 31, 1893 the Institute moved into the new building. For the opening reception on December 8, 1893, [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]] and the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] performed. From the 1900s (decade) to the 1960s the school offered with the Logan Family (members of the board) the [[Logan Medal of the Arts]], an award which became one of the most distinguished awards presented to artists in the US.

Between 1959 and 1970 the Institute was a key site in the battle to gain art & documentary photography a place in galleries, under curator [[Hugh Edwards (curator)|Hugh Edwards]] and his assistants.

As Director of the museum starting in the early 1980s, [[James N. Wood]] conducted a major expansion of its collection and oversaw a major renovation and expansion project for its facilities. As "one of the most respected museum leaders in the country", as described by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Wood created major exhibitions of works by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Claude Monet]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] that set records for attendance at the museum. He retired from the museum in 2004.<ref>Kennedy, Randy. [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/15/arts/design/15wood.html "James N. Wood, President of the Getty Trust, Dies at 69"], ''The New York Times'', June 14, 2010. Accessed June 21, 2010.</ref>

In 2006, the Art Institute began construction of "The Modern Wing", an addition situated on the southwest corner of Columbus and Monroe. The project, designed by [[Pritzker Prize]] winning architect [[Renzo Piano]], was completed and officially opened to the public on May 16, 2009. The {{convert|264000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} building makes the Art Institute the second-largest art museum in the United States. The building houses the museum's world-renowned collections of 20th- and 21st-century art, specifically modern European painting and sculpture, contemporary art, architecture and design, and photography.  In 2014, travel review website and forum, [[Tripadvisor]], reviewed millions of travelers' surveys and named the Art Institute the world's best museum.<ref>{{cite web|title=These Are the 25 Best Museums in the World |url=http://time.com/3393565/best-museums-trip-advisor| author=Grossman, Samantha |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]|date= 2014-09-18| accessdate=September 19, 2014}}</ref>

In April 2015, it was announced that the museum received perhaps the largest gift of art in its history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/museums/chi-art-institute-donation-andy-warhol-20150421-20150421-column.html|title=Art Institute of Chicago gets its largest gift ever, including 9 Warhols|author=Chicago Tribune|date=22 April 2015|work=chicagotribune.com}}</ref>  Collectors Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson donated a "collection [that] is among the world's greatest groups of postwar Pop art ever assembled."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/04/22/401469571/gift-worth-400-million-to-art-institute-of-chicago-includes-works-by-warhol|title=Gift Worth $400 Million To Art Institute Of Chicago Includes Works By Warhol|date=22 April 2015|work=NPR.org}}</ref>  The donation includes works by [[Andy Warhol]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Cy Twombly]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]], [[Richard Prince]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and [[Gerhard Richter]].

The collection of the Art Institute of Chicago encompasses more than 5,000 years of human expression from cultures around the world and contains more than 260,000 works of art. The museum holds works of art ranging from early Japanese prints to modern American art.  It is principally known for one of the United States' finest collection of paintings produced in Western culture.<ref name=Oxford>{{cite book| title=The Oxford Dictionary of Art: The Art Institute of Chicago| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| editor-last=Chilvers| editor-first=Ian|  year=2004| pages=813–814| isbn=978-0192800220| quote=Celebrated masterpieces: ''Nighthawks''; ''American Gothic''; ''A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte.''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.foxnews.com/travel/2013/05/03/world-most-beautiful-museums/ | title=World's most beautiful museums | publisher=Fox News.com | date=2013-05-03 | accessdate=2013-05-04 | quote=Must-see masterpieces: Georges Seurat's ''A Sunday on the Island of La Grande Jatte'', ''Nighthawks'', and Vincent Van Gogh's ''Bedroom in Arles''.}}</ref>

Today, the museum is most famous for its collections of [[Impressionism|Impressionist]], [[Post-impressionism|Post-Impressionist]], and [[Visual art of the United States|American]] paintings. Highlights included in the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection include more than 30 paintings by [[Claude Monet]] including six of his [[Haystacks (Monet)|''Haystacks'']] and a number of ''[[Water Lilies]]''. Also in the collection are important works by [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] such as ''[[Two Sisters (On the Terrace)]],'' and [[Gustave Caillebotte]]'s ''[[Paris Street; Rainy Day]].'' Post-Impressionists include [[Paul Cézanne]]'s ''[[The Basket of Apples]]'', and ''[[Marie-Hortense Fiquet|Madame Cézanne]] in a Yellow Chair.'' ''[[At the Moulin Rouge]]'' by [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] is another highlight. The [[Pointillism|pointillist]] masterpiece, which also inspired [[Sunday in the Park with George|a musical]], [[Georges Seurat|Georges Seurat's]] ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]],'' is prominently displayed. Additionally, [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Bathers by a River'', is an important example of his work.  Highlights of non-French paintings of the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist collection include [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s ''[[Bedroom in Arles]]'' and ''[[:File:VanGogh 1887 Selbstbildnis.jpg|Self-portrait]], 1887''.

Among the most important works of the American collection are [[Mary Cassatt]]'s ''[[The Child's Bath]],'' [[Grant Wood]]'s ''[[American Gothic]],'' and [[Edward Hopper]]'s ''[[Nighthawks]].''  ''The Child's Bath'' (1892), Cassatt's intimate portrayal, unusual for the time, was first exhibited in 1890s Paris and came into the collection in 1910.  Although in the main Cassatt is an impressionist, the work's subject matter and the overhead perspective were inspired by Japanese [[Woodcut|woodblock]]s.<ref>[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111442 Painting profile] from the Art Institute of Chicago.</ref><ref>[http://www.artic.edu/artaccess/AA_Impressionist/pages/IMP_6.shtml Art Access] at the Art Institute of Chicago.</ref> The more formal portrait, ''[[American Gothic]]'' (1930), by Wood, depicts what has been called "the most famous couple in the world," a dour, rural-American, father and daughter.  It was entered into a contest at the Art Institute in 1930, and although not a favorite of some, it won a medal and was acquired by the museum.<ref name=fineman>Fineman, Mia, [http://www.slate.com/id/2120494/ The Most Famous Farm Couple in the World: Why American Gothic still fascinates.], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', 8 June 2005</ref><ref name="about">{{cite web | title=About This Artwork: American Gothic | url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/6565 | publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago | accessdate=June 20, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528093948/http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/6565| archivedate= 28 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Considered an "icon of American culture",<ref name="artic.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/hopper/nighthawks|title=Nighthawks|work=artic.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/2007/hopper/acloserlooka.shtm | title=Edward Hopper | publisher=National Gallery of Art | work=A Closer Look | year=2006 | accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref> ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) is perhaps Hopper's most famous painting, as well as one of the most recognizable images in [[Visual art of the United States|American art]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/111628 | title=About This Artwork: Nighthawks, 1942 | publisher=Art Institute of Chicago | accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/nighthawks/ | title=Edward Hopper's Nighthawks | publisher=National Public Radio | work=Present at the Creation | date=2002-10-07 | accessdate=2013-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=The Art Institute of Chicago, 20th-Century: Painting and Sculpture | publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago | author=Wood, James N. | year=1996 | location=Chicago | isbn=0865590966}}</ref>  Within months of its completion, ''Nighthawks'' was sold to the Art Institute of Chicago for $3,000.<ref name="artic.edu"/><ref>The sale was recorded by Josephine Hopper as follows, in volume II, p. 95 of her and Edward's journal of his art: "May 13, '42: Chicago Art Institute - 3,000 + return of Compartment C in exchange as part payment. 1,000 - 1/3 = 2,000."

Whereas, the museum's new Modern Wing (see below) displays additional important works from the 20th and 21st centuries.

===Terra Collection===
Since April 2005, approximately fifty paintings originally from the [[Terra Museum]] (now the Terra Foundation) collection have been on loan to the Department of American Art at the Art Institute of Chicago. The collections of the Terra and the Art Institute are located in a new suite of galleries, and together provide one of the nation’s most comprehensive presentations of [[Visual art of the United States|American art]]. The foundation’s collection of American works on paper are housed in the Department of Prints and Drawings at the Art Institute.

===African American Art Collection===
[[File:Frederick Douglass by Samuel J Miller, 1847-52.png|thumb|150px|''Frederick Douglass'', daguerreotype by Samuel J Miller, 1847-52 in the collection]]
Institutions like the Art Institute of Chicago have assisted in creating a place for African American art to be explored freely without the restraints that once accompanied it. The pieces included in the Art Institute of Chicago's African American art collection provide a historical illustration of the progress made by African Americans as well as their continuing struggle.

Specific pieces in this section of the museum give insight into the racial boundaries that existed in the past. [[Samuel J. Miller]]'s [[Frederick Douglass]] [[daguerreotype]] is an example of the way some African Americans managed to break away from stereotypes. The daguerreotype had been used by people like [[Louis Agassiz]] to show a "type" for ethnic groups. The style of [[J.T. Zealy]]'s daguerreotype photographs made the subject seem vulnerable, even animalistic. For example, "Delia" (1850) shows a female slave completely exposed and in a sense victimized by the camera. Conversely, the Douglass daguerreotype shows a well-dressed man with a strong expression. This is the complete opposite from the submissiveness of the slaves in the Zealy photos. Douglass represented a new kind of Negro. He was educated and well-respected. This marks a shift in the idea of blackness and the way it is represented.

An artist that took it upon himself to continue to change the way blacks were in portrayed in art is [[Archibald Motley|Archibald John Motley, Jr.]] He aimed to paint "his people" just as they were.  Motley said he “wanted to instill a sense of racial pride into his work.<ref name="Rossen">Rossen, Susan F., ed. ''Selections from The Art Institute of Chicago: African Americans in Art''. Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 1999.</ref> Motley attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and had to deal with occasional harassment from white classmates. Yet, he continued to believe that art was the best way to approach racial tensions.<ref name="Rossen"/>{{rp|27}}
	
In his piece ''The Octoroon Girl'' (1925), Motley challenges the conventional image of an African American. While the woman in the painting fits the mold of "whiteness," she actually is 1/8 black. Breaking away from the traditional views of blacks was indicative of the time period. References such as octoroon or mulatto were used to describe how much "black blood" a person possessed. Motley takes this concept from a negative connotation to one that is independent of social status.
[[Image:RichmondBarthe-boxer.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Richmond Barthé]], ''Boxer'' (the Cuban featherweight, "Kid Chocolate"), 1942]]
Another piece included in the Art Institute of Chicago's African American art collection is "The Boxer" by [[Richmond Barthé]]. Barthe is a significant figure among African American artists because his work was widely exhibited and recognized by reputable organizations. His sculptures depicted African Americans but were sought after pieces in the mainstream art world. In 1942, "The Boxer" coincided with a time period where black boxers such as [[Joe Louis]] were fighting white opponents and  beating them. This signified a big step for African Americans and equality, at least in the ring.

The changing idea of blackness and African American art was also advanced by artists like [[Jacob Lawrence]]. Most of his work focused on African American history and utilized techniques like repetition to emphasize his message. In ''Graduation'', 1948, Lawrence addresses the importance of getting a diploma and how the event can affect a family's morale. This piece went along with Langston Hughes' poem by the same title.<ref name="Rossen"/>{{rp|66}} The contrast of black and white in the painting can indicate the fact that such an event is significant to both African and white Americans. An emphasis on education has been central to African American advancement. Frederick Douglas was a major supporter of the idea that education was the path to social equality. "Graduation" manages to depict blacks as academically oriented, a positive image of African Americans.

The use of art as political motivators has been a key factor in African American art. The Art Institute's collection also touches on the social implications of African American art. Black artists are a result of the fight their ancestors faced and the current boundaries that are still left to cross.<ref>Parker, Daniel Texidor. ''African Art: The Diaspora and Beyond''. Chicago: Daniel Texidor Parker, 2004. pg. 61.</ref> This powerful medium has evoked discussion about racial tensions and brought attentions that would have otherwise gone under the radar. Such approaches coincided with the emergence of political groups such as the NAACP and Africobra, for artists. African American artists utilized their work to address social and political issues of black people.<ref>''The Art of Culture: Evolution of Visual Arts by African American Artists, the Last Fifty Years''. Chicago: Africa International House USA, 2003. pg. 18.</ref> The combination of forces led to a more prevalent public conversation about racial equality.  As African American artists banded together for projects such as the Wall of Respect, their concerns came to the forefront.  Their paintbrushes had power.

In essence, the Art Institute of Chicago provides an accurate historical narrative of the lives of African Americans. Comparing daguerreotype images to the more recent pieces show a world of difference. Not only has the perception of African Americans changed, but also African American artists have established a separate school of art. The shift from being defined by African influence, to simply learning from the African link, has helped these artists break the mold they were previously forced to fit.

The current building at 111 South Michigan Avenue is the third address for the Art Institute.  It was designed in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] style by [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]] of [[Boston]]<ref name=formyrs>{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/formative/index.html|accessdate=2007-06-20|title=1879–1913: The Formative Years|publisher=The Art Institute of Chicago|year=2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070609191723/http://www.artic.edu/aic/aboutus/wip/formative/index.html| archivedate= 9 June 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> for the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] as the World's Congress Auxiliary Building with the intent that the Art Institute occupy the space after the fair closed.

[[File:Interrior view, Art Institute of Chicago.jpg|thumb|Interior view, Art Institute of Chicago]]

The Art Institute's famous western entrance on [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] is guarded by two [[bronze]] [[lion]] statues created by [[Edward Kemeys]]. The sculptor gave them unofficial names: the south lion is "stands in an attitude of defiance," and the north lion is "on the prowl." When a Chicago sports team plays in the championships of their respective league (i.e. the Super Bowl or Stanley Cup Finals, not the entire playoffs), the lions are frequently dressed in that team's uniform. Evergreen wreaths are placed around their necks during the Christmas season.

The east entrance of the museum is marked by the stone arch entrance to the old [[Chicago Stock Exchange]]. Designed by [[Louis Sullivan]] in 1894, the Exchange was torn down in 1972, but salvaged portions of the original trading room were brought to the Art Institute and reconstructed.

The Art Institute building has the unusual property of straddling open-air railroad tracks. Two stories of gallery space connect the east and west buildings while the [[Metra Electric]] and [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore]] lines operate below. The lower level of gallery space was formerly the windowless Gunsaulus hall, but is now home to the Alsdorf Galleries showcasing Indian, Southeast Asian and Himalayan Art. During renovation, windows facing north toward Millennium Park were added. The gallery space was designed by [[Renzo Piano]] in conjunction with his design of the Modern Wing and features the same window screening used there to protect the art from direct sunlight. The upper level formerly held the modern European galleries, but was renovated in 2008 and now features the Impressionist and Post-Impressionist galleries.

=== Attendance ===
During 2009, attendance was around 2 million—up 33 percent from 2008—in addition to a total of approximately 100,000 museum memberships. Despite a 25 percent boost in museum admission fees, the Modern Wing was a major catalyst for a rise in visitor traffic.<ref>Lauren Viera (May 9, 2011), [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-05-09/entertainment/ct-live-0510-james-cuno-resigns-20110509_1_james-cuno-modern-wing-art-institute Art Institute leader resigns] ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.</ref>

=== Finances ===
[[File:Art Institute of Chicago Michigan Avenue.jpg|thumb|left|Art Institute of Chicago, [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]]]]

As of 2011, the Art Institute continues to rebuild its $783 million endowment since the [[Great Recession|recession]].<ref>Kelly Crow (August 24, 2011), [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904875404576528873604216228.html "Chicago's Art Institute Names New Director"]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.</ref> In June 2008, its endowment was $827 million. As of 2012, the museum is rated A1 by [[Moody’s]], its fifth-highest grade, in part reflecting the museum’s pension and retirement liabilities; [[Standard & Poor’s]] rates the museum A+, fifth-best. In October 2012, the Art Institute sold about $100 million of taxable and tax-exempt bonds partly to shore up unfunded pension obligations.<ref>Brian Chappatta (October 9, 2012), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-10-09/chicago-art-institute-borrows-100-million-for-pensions Chicago Art Institute Borrows $100 Million for Pensions] ''[[Businessweek]]''.</ref>

The $294 million extension in 2009 was the culmination of a $385 million fundraising campaign—roughly $300 million for design and construction and $85 million for the endowment. Around $370 million were raised primarily from private patrons in Chicago.<ref>Jason Edward Kaufman (May 13, 2009), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Art-Institute-of-Chicago-s-massive-extension-opens/17325 Art Institute of Chicago’s massive extension opens] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref> In 2011, the Art Institute received a $10 million gift from the Jaharis Family Foundation to renovate and expand galleries devoted to Greek, Roman and Byzantine art, as well as to support acquisitions and special exhibitions of that art.<ref>Kate Taylor (February 27, 2011), [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/28/arts/design/28arts-AGIFTFORARTI_BRF.html A Gift for Art Institute] ''[[New York Times]]''.</ref>

=== Acquisitions and deaccessioning ===
In 1990, the Art Institute of Chicago sold 11 works at auction, including paintings by [[Claude Monet]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Maurice Utrillo]] and [[Edgar Degas]], to raise the $12 million purchase price of a bronze sculpture, ''Golden Bird'', by [[Constantin Brâncuși]]. At the time, the sculpture was owned by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]], which was selling it to buy a new gallery for its other works.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-10/entertainment/ca-1857_1_chicago-gallery Chicago Gallery to Sell 11 Works to Buy Brancusi] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', May 10, 1990.</ref> In 2005, the museum sold two paintings by [[Marc Chagall]] and [[Auguste Renoir]] at [[Sotheby's]].<ref>Carol Vogel (October 26, 2005), [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/26/arts/design/26muse.html Museums Set to Sell Art, and Some Experts Cringe] ''[[The New York Times]]''.</ref> In 2011, it auctioned two Picassos (''Sur l'impériale traversant la Seine'' (1901) and ''Verre et pipe'' (1919)), [[Henri Matisse]]'s ''Femme au fauteuil'' (1919), and [[Georges Braque]]'s ''Nature morte à la guitare (rideaux rouge)'' (1938) at [[Christie's]] in London.<ref>Lauren Viera (January 11, 2011), [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-01-11/entertainment/ct-live-0112-art-institute-developmen20110111_1_art-institute-paintings-institute-spokeswoman-erin-hogan-deaccession Art Institute paintings to fetch $10-$16 million at auction] ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.</ref><ref name=Pogrebin11>{{cite news| first=Robin| last=Pogrebin| date=January 26, 2011| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/27/arts/design/27sell.html| title=The Permanent Collection May Not Be So Permanent| work=The New York Times}}</ref>

=== Controversy ===
In 2002, the Art Institute of Chicago filed suit alleging fraud by a small Dallas firm called Integral Investment Management, along with related parties. The museum, which put $43 million of its endowment into funds run by the defendants, claimed that it faced losses of up to 90% on the investments after they soured.<ref name=Economist>{{cite journal| url=http://www.economist.com/node/922809| title=Stick to paintings| work=[[The Economist]]| date=3 January 2002| accessdate=2014-10-24}}</ref>

In 2010, the year after the opening of its massive Modern Wing, the Art Institute of Chicago sued the engineering firm [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup]] for $10 million over what it said were flaws in the concrete floors and air-circulation systems. The suit was settled out of court.<ref name=Finkel14>{{cite news| first=Jori| last=Finkel| date=3 June 2014| title=Eli Broad’s Art Showcase, Still Unfinished, Sues Over Delays in Los Angeles| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/arts/design/eli-broads-los-angeles-art-showcase-still-unfinished-sues-over-delays.html| work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref name=Kapos13>{{cite news| title=Art Institute closes Modern Wing's 3rd floor for 7 months| url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20130917/NEWS07/130919817/art-institute-closes-modern-wings-3rd-floor-for-7-months#| last=Kapos| first=Shia| date=17 September 2013| work=[[Crain's Chicago Business]]| accessdate=2014-10-24}}</ref>

==The Art Institute in film==
Film director [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] included a sequence featuring his favorite items in the Art Institute, in his acclaimed 1986 film ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'', which is set in Chicago. Hughes had first visited the Institute, as a "refuge", while in high school. The sequence features three high school seniors, his main protagonists, admiring the works with a musical sound track.<ref name="ferris_commentary">{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p89gBjHB2Gs&feature=youtube_gdata_player|title=John Hughes commentary - The Museum scene from Ferris Bueller's Day Off|date=7 August 2009|work=YouTube}}</ref> Hughes' commentary on the sequence was used as a reference point by journalist [[Hadley Freeman]] in a discussion of the Republican Presidential primary candidates in 2011.<ref name="freeman">[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/nov/15/werner-herzog-america-republican Two new films reveal the death and triumph of the American dream], Hadley Freeman, ''The Guardian'', November 15, 2011</ref>
