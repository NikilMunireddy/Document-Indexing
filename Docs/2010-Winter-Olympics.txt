{{2010 Winter Olympics}}

The '''2010 Winter Olympics''', officially known as the '''XXI Olympic Winter Games''' (French: Les ''XXIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver'') and commonly known as '''Vancouver 2010''', informally the 21st [[Winter Olympics]], were a major international [[multi-sport event]] held from February 12 to 28, 2010, in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], with some events held in the suburbs of [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[West Vancouver]] and the [[University Endowment Lands]], and in the [[resort town]] of [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]. Approximately 2,600 athletes from 82 nations participated in 86 events in fifteen disciplines. Both the Olympic and [[2010 Winter Paralympics|Paralympic Games]] were organized by the [[Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|Vancouver Organizing Committee]] (VANOC), headed by [[John Furlong (CEO)|John Furlong]]. The 2010 Winter Olympics were the third [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] hosted by Canada and the first by the province of British Columbia. Previously, Canada hosted the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], and the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]].

Following Olympic tradition, then-Vancouver mayor [[Sam Sullivan]] received the [[Olympic symbols|Olympic flag]] during the [[2006 Winter Olympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics]] in [[Turin]], Italy. The flag was raised on February 28, 2006, in a special ceremony and was on display at [[Vancouver City Hall]] until the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|Olympic opening ceremony]]. The event was officially opened by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]],<ref name=govgen>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13510| author=Office of the Governor General of Canada|title=Governor General to Open the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games|date=February 8, 2010|publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada|accessdate=September 21, 2012}}</ref> who was accompanied by Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] and International Olympic Committee president [[Jacques Rogge]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/2.722/gretzky-lights-up-vancouver-olympics-1.935989 | title=Gretzky lights up Vancouver Olympics | publisher=CBC | work=[[CBC Sports]] | date=February 12, 2010 | accessdate=August 14, 2012 | author=Robson, Dan}}</ref>

For the first time, Canada won gold in an [[Olympic sports|"official" sport]] at an Olympic Games hosted at home, having failed to do so at both the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary (although Canada won a gold medal in the [[demonstration sport]] of curling in Calgary). Canada clinched their first gold medal on the second day of the competition and first topped the gold medal tally on the second to last day of competition and went on to become the first host nation since [[Norway at the 1952 Winter Olympics|Norway in 1952]] to lead the gold medal count.<ref name="clinch">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/27/us-clinches-medals-total-canada-most-golds/ | title=U.S. clinches medals mark, Canada ties gold record | date=February 27, 2010 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=January 25, 2011 | location=Vancouver}}</ref> With 14, Canada broke the record for the most gold medals won at a single Winter Olympics, which was 13, set by the former [[Soviet Union at the 1976 Winter Olympics|Soviet Union in 1976]] and [[Norway at the 2002 Winter Olympics|Norway in 2002]].<ref name=RecordGolds>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2010/02/27/sp-canada-gold-otp.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100303045557/http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/story/2010/02/27/sp-canada-gold-otp.html|archivedate=2010-03-03|title=Canada sets Olympic gold record|date=February 27, 2010|accessdate=February 27, 2010|author=Canadian Press|publisher=CBC Sports}}</ref> The [[United States at the 2010 Winter Olympics|United States won the most medals]] in total, their second time doing so at the Winter Olympics, and broke the record for the most medals won at a single Winter Olympics with 37, a record held up to then by [[Germany at the 2002 Winter Olympics|Germany in 2002]] with 36 medals.<ref name="clinch" /> Athletes from [[Slovakia at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Slovakia]]<ref>{{cite news|work=[[The Australian]]|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/sport/anastasiya-kuzmina-wins-slovakia-first-winter-crown/story-e6frg7mf-1225830166112|title=Anastazia Kuzmina wins Slovakia first winter crown |date=February 14, 2010|accessdate=February 21, 2010}}</ref> and [[Belarus at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Belarus]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/02/26/us-olympics-freestyle-medals-idUSTRE61O12Y20100226 | title=Grishin Grabs First Gold For Belarus | date=February 26, 2010 | agency=[[Reuters]] | accessdate=February 26, 2010 | location=Vancouver}}</ref> won the first Winter Olympic gold medals for their nations.

The Canadian Olympic Association chose Vancouver as the Canadian candidate city over Calgary, which sought to re-host the Games and [[Quebec City]], which had lost the 2002 Olympic bid in 1995. On the first round of voting on November 21, 1998, Vancouver-Whistler had 26 votes, Quebec City had 25 and Calgary had 21. On December 3, 1998, the second and final round of voting occurred between the two leading contenders, which saw Vancouver win with 40 votes compared to Quebec City's 32 votes. Vancouver had also previously bid for the [[Bids_for_the_1976_Winter_Olympics| 1976]] and [[1980_Winter_Olympics| 1980]] games.

After the [[2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal|bribery scandal]] over the candidacy of the [[Salt Lake City]] bid for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] (which resulted in Quebec City asking for compensation (C$8 million) for its unsuccessful bid),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamOlympicScandalArchive/mar23_ioc.html |title=IOC rejects Quebec City request|date=March 23, 1999|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|Slam! Olympics]]|accessdate=January 7, 2009}}</ref> many of the rules of the bidding process were changed in 1999. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) created the Evaluation Commission, which was appointed on October 24, 2002. Prior to the bidding for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], host cities would often fly members of the IOC to their city where they toured the city and were provided with gifts. The lack of oversight and transparency often led to allegations of money for votes. Afterward, changes brought forth by the IOC bidding rules were tightened, and more focused on technical aspects of candidate cities. The team analyzed the candidate city features and provided its input back to the IOC.

Vancouver won the bid to host the Olympics by a vote of the International Olympic Committee on July 2, 2003, at the 115th IOC Session held in [[Prague]], Czech Republic. The result was announced by IOC President [[Jacques Rogge]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sport/newsid_3039000/3039690.stm|title=Vancouver to host 2010 Winter Olympics|publisher=[[BBC|CBBC Newsround]]|date=July 2, 2003|accessdate=January 7, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090131105840/http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/sport/newsid_3039000/3039690.stm| archivedate=January 31, 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Vancouver faced two other finalists shortlisted that same February: [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], South Korea, and [[Salzburg]], Austria. Pyeongchang had the most votes of the three cities in the first round of voting, in which Salzburg was eliminated. In the run-off, all but two of the members who had voted for Salzburg voted for Vancouver. It was the closest vote by the IOC since Sydney, Australia beat Beijing for the 2000 Summer Olympics by two votes. Vancouver's victory came almost two years after Toronto's [[Bids for the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympic bid]] was defeated by Beijing in a landslide vote.

The Vancouver Olympic Committee (VANOC) spent C$16.6 million on upgrading facilities at [[Cypress Mountain]], which hosted the freestyle (aerials, moguls, ski cross) and snowboarding events. With the opening in February 2009 of the C$40&nbsp;million [[Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre]] at [[Hillcrest Park]], which hosted curling, every sports venue for the 2010 Games was completed on time and at least one year prior to the Games.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.crsportsnews.com/?id=785988&keys=Olympics-Venue-Vancouver-Paralympic |title=New Vancouver 2010 Sports Venues Completed |publisher=Crsportsnews.com |date=February 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-news/n/news/vancouver-2010-sport-venues-completed-on-time-and-within-$580-million-budget.-vancouver-olympic-paralympic-centre-opens-today-as-a-model-of-sustainable-building-_63896GI.html |title=Vancouver 2010 sport venues completed on time and within C$580-million budget.

==Financials==

===Operations===
In 2004, the operational cost of the 2010 Winter Olympics was estimated to be Canadian $1.354&nbsp;billion (about [[£]]828,499,787, [[€]]975,033,598 or [[US$]]1,314,307,896). As of mid-2009 it was projected to be C$1.76&nbsp;billion,<ref name="huffingtonpost1">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/08/vancouvers-poverty-olympi_n_453593.html |title=Vancouver's 'Poverty Olympics' Protest Millions Spent On Winter Games |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |date=February 8, 2010}}</ref> mostly raised from non-government sources,<ref name="huffingtonpost1"/> primarily through sponsorships and the auction of national broadcasting rights. C$580&nbsp;million was the taxpayer-supported budget to construct or renovate venues throughout Vancouver and Whistler. A final audit conducted by [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]] released in December 2010 revealed total operation cost to have been $1.84 billion and came in on budget resulting in neither surplus nor deficit. Construction of venues also came on budget with a total cost of $603 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Vancouver+Olympics+generated+billion/3997570/story.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223121323/http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/Vancouver+Olympics+generated+billion/3997570/story.html|archivedate=2010-12-23 |title=Vancouver Olympics generated $2.5 billion |publisher=Calgaryherald.com |date=December 18, 2010 |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}</ref>

PricewaterhouseCoopers' study estimated a total contribution to the BC economy of $2.3 billion of Gross Domestic Product, and as well creating 45,000 jobs and contributing an additional $463 million to the tourism industry while venue construction by VANOC and 3rd parties added $1.22 billion to the economy, far short of the $10 billion forecast by Premier Gordon Campbell.  The study also said that hosting the Olympics was one of many reasons why the provincial debt grew by $24 billion during the decade.  In 2011, the provincial auditor-general declined to conduct a post-Games audit.<ref>[http://metronews.ca/features/legacies-of-the-2010-vancouver-olympics/904188/vancouvers-recession-rocked-olympics-left-a-mixed-economic-legacy/ ''Vancouver’s recession-rocked Olympics left a mixed economic legacy'', Bob Mackin, Metronews.ca, January 2014]</ref>

===Security costs===
C$200&nbsp;million was expected to be spent for security, which was organized through a special body, the [[Integrated Security Unit]], of which the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) was the lead agency; other government agencies such as the [[Vancouver Police Department]], [[Canada Border Services Agency]], [[Canadian Forces]], and [[Law enforcement in Canada|police agencies across Canada]]. The [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS) also played a role. That number was later revealed to be in the region of C$1&nbsp;billion, an amount in excess of five times what was originally estimated.<ref>{{cite news|title=Olympic security estimated to cost C$900M|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/02/19/bc-olympics-cost-colin-hansen.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221115608/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/02/19/bc-olympics-cost-colin-hansen.html|archivedate=2009-02-21|date=February 19, 2009|publisher= CBC News| accessdate=January 25, 2011 }}</ref>

The opening and closing ceremonies were held at [[BC Place Stadium]], which received over C$150&nbsp;million in major renovations. Competition venues in Greater Vancouver included the [[Pacific Coliseum]], the [[Hillcrest Centre|Vancouver Olympic/Paralympic Centre]], the [[UBC Winter Sports Centre]], the [[Richmond Olympic Oval]] and [[Cypress Mountain]]. [[GM Place]] (now known as [[Rogers Arena]]), home of the NHL's [[Vancouver Canucks]], played host to [[ice hockey]] events, being renamed ''Canada Hockey Place'' for the duration of the Games since corporate sponsorship is not allowed for an Olympic venue.<ref name="chp"/> Renovations included the removal of advertising from the ice surface and conversion of some seating to accommodate the media.<ref name="chp">{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvbc.ctv.ca/servlet/an/plocal/CTVNews/20080806/BC_GM_place_new_name_080806/20080806/?hub=BritishColumbiaHome |title=GM Place to get new name for 2010|publisher=[[CTV News]]|year=2008|accessdate=January 7, 2009}}</ref> The 2010 Winter Olympics marked the first time an Olympic hockey game was played on a rink sized according to NHL rules instead of [[International Ice Hockey Federation|international]] specifications.

The 2010 Winter Games marked the first time that the energy consumption of the Olympic venues was tracked in real time and made available to the public. Energy data was collected from the metering and building automation systems of nine of the Olympic venues and was displayed online through the Venue Energy Tracker project.<ref>{{cite news|title=Measuring the Power of Sport|publisher=The Globe and Mail|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/measuring-the-power-of-sport-one-venue-at-a-time/article1455631/|accessdate=February 4, 2010|location=Toronto}}</ref>

[[Leo Obstbaum]] (1969–2009), the late director of design for the 2010 Winter Olympics, oversaw and designed many of the main symbols of the Games, including the mascots, medals and the design of the Olympic torches.<ref name=ctv>{{cite news |first=Josh|last=Wingrove|title=Vancouver Olympic designer dies at age 40|url=http://www.ctvolympics.ca/about-vancouver/news/newsid=14464.html?cid=rssctv |work=[[Globe and Mail]]|publisher=[[CTV Television Network]]|date=August 21, 2009 |accessdate=February 14, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100130104759/http://www.ctvolympics.ca/about-vancouver/news/newsid=14464.html?cid=rssctv| archivedate=January 30, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

The 2010 Winter Olympics logo was unveiled on April 23, 2005, and is named Ilanaaq the [[Inunnguaq]]. Ilanaaq is the [[Inuktitut language|Inuktitut]] word for ''friend''. The logo was based on the [[Inukshuk]] (stone landmark or cairn) built by Alvin Kanak for the Northwest Territories Pavilion at [[Expo 86]] and donated to the City of Vancouver after the event. It is now used as a landmark on [[English Bay Beach]].

The mascots for the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Vicki Wong and Michael C. Murphy of [[Meomi Design]] and introduced on November 27, 2007.<ref>{{cite news | title = 2010 Vancouver Olympics' mascots inspired by First Nations creatures | publisher = [[CBC Sports]] | date = November 27, 2007 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2007/11/27/bc-mascot.html | accessdate =  November 27, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071130050741/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2007/11/27/bc-mascot.html| archivedate=November 30, 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Inspired by traditional [[First Nations]] creatures, the mascots include:

==Media coverage==
{{See also|List of 2010 Winter Olympics broadcasters}}
The Olympic Games in Vancouver were broadcast worldwide by a number of television broadcasters. As rights for the 2010 Games have been packaged with those for the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], broadcasters were largely identical for both events.

The host broadcaster was Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver, a subsidiary of the IOC's new in-house broadcasting unit [[Olympic Broadcasting Services]] (OBS). The 2010 Olympics marked the first Games where the host broadcasting facilities were provided solely by OBS.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obsv.ca/obsintroduction.html |title=OBSV Introduction |publisher=Obsv.ca |date= |accessdate=January 10, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100120040058/http://www.obsv.ca/obsintroduction.html| archivedate=January 20, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The executive director of Olympic Broadcasting Services Vancouver was [[Nancy Lee (producer)|Nancy Lee]], a former producer and executive for [[CBC Sports]].<ref name="lee">[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2006/10/17/lee-nancy-cbc.html "Nancy Lee leaving CBC Sports"], [[cbc.ca]], October 10, 2006.</ref>

In Canada, the Games were the first Olympic Games broadcast by a new Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium led by [[CTVglobemedia]] and [[Rogers Media]], displacing previous broadcaster [[CBC Sports]]. Main English-language coverage was shown on the [[CTV Television Network]], while supplementary programming was mainly shown on [[The Sports Network|TSN]] and [[Rogers Sportsnet]]. Main French-language coverage was shown on [[V (TV network)|V]] and [[Réseau des sports|RDS]].<ref>{{cite news |title=CTV wins 2010 and 2012 Olympic broadcast rights |publisher=[[CBC Sports]] |date=February 9, 2005 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/02/07/ctv050207.html |accessdate=September 21, 2008}}</ref>

In the United States, [[Associated Press]] (AP) announced that it would send 120 reporters, photographers, editors and videographers to cover the Games on behalf of the country's [[news media]].<ref name="eandp10">{{cite web | title= AP Seeks New Internet Business Model in Winter Olympics | url= http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004065140 | publisher= [[Editor & Publisher]] | date= February 4, 2010| accessdate=February 4, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100206010625/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004065140| archivedate=February 6, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref>  The cost of their Olympics coverage prompted AP to make a "real departure for the [[wire service]]'s online coverage". Rather than simply providing content, it partnered with more than 900 newspapers and broadcasters who split the ad revenue generated from an AP-produced multi-media package of video, photos, statistics, stories and a daily Webcast.<ref name="eandp10"/>  AP's coverage included a [[microsite]] with [[web widget]]s facilitating integration with [[social networking]] and [[Social bookmarking|bookmarking services]].<ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100716172609/http://wintergames.ap.org/help/faq.pdf About this Vancouver 2010 Winter Games Microsite] from wintergames.ap.org</ref>
On [[NBC]], [[Bob Costas]] hosted the primetime telecast, while [[Al Michaels]] did so during the day.  Together they co-hosted NBC's coverage of the  [[2010 Winter Olympics Closing Ceremony|Closing Ceremony]].

In France, the Games were covered by [[France Télévisions]], which included continuous live coverage on its website.<ref>[http://jo-hiver-vancouver-2010.francetv.fr/ Jeux olympiques d'Hiver: Vancouver 2010], [[France Télévisions]]</ref>

The official broadcast theme for the Olympic Broadcasting Services host broadcast was a piece called 'City Of Ice' composed by [[Rob May]] and [[Simon Hill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sittingduckmusicandmedia.com/team.html |title=Sitting Duck – Team |publisher=Sittingduckmusicandmedia.com |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref>

==Torch relay==
[[File:Vancouver-Olympics-clock.jpg|thumb|right|The clock counting down to the opening of Olympics Games in [[Downtown Vancouver]].]]
{{Main|2010 Winter Olympics torch relay}}
The Olympic Torch Relay is the transfer of the Olympic flame from Ancient [[Olympia, Greece]] — where the first Olympic Games were held thousands of years ago — to the stadium of the city hosting the current Olympic Games. The flame arrives just in time for the [[2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony|Opening Ceremony]].

For the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, the flame was lit in Olympia on October 22, 2009.<ref>{{cite news

The relay started its long Canada journey from the British Columbia capital of [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]. In Canada, the torch traveled approximately {{convert|45000|km|mi}} over 106 days, making it the longest relay route within one country in Olympic history. The Olympic Torch was carried by approximately 12,000 Canadians and reached over 1,000 communities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Funding for 2010 Olympics torch relay to focus on local events|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/funding-for-2010-olympics-torch-relay-to-focus-on-local-events-1.820728|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=December 23, 2009|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]]}}</ref><ref>

The opening and closing ceremonies and the events categorized as ice sports (excluding bobsleigh, luge and skeleton) were held in Vancouver and Richmond. The sports categorized as "Nordic events" were held in the Callaghan Valley located just to the west of Whistler. All alpine skiing events were held on [[Whistler Blackcomb|Whistler Mountain]] (Creekside) and sliding events (bobsleigh, luge and skeleton) were held on [[Whistler Blackcomb|Blackcomb Mountain]]. [[Cypress Mountain]] (located in [[Cypress Provincial Park]] in [[West Vancouver]]) hosted the freestyle skiing (aerials, moguls and ski cross), and all snowboard events (half-pipe, parallel giant slalom, snowboard cross).

Vancouver 2010 was also the first winter Olympics in which both men's and women's hockey were played on a narrower, [[National Hockey League|NHL]]-sized ice rink,<ref name="VANOC shrinks ice"/> measuring 200&nbsp;ft&nbsp;× 85&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m&nbsp;× 26&nbsp;m), instead of the international size of 200&nbsp;ft&nbsp;× 98.5&nbsp;ft (61&nbsp;m&nbsp;× 30&nbsp;m). The games were played at [[General Motors Place]] (now Rogers Arena), home of the NHL's [[Vancouver Canucks]], which was temporarily renamed Canada Hockey Place for the duration of the Olympics. Utilizing this existing venue instead of building a new international-sized ice rink facility saved <!--Canadian--->$10&nbsp;million in construction costs and allowed an additional 35,000 spectators to attend Olympic hockey games.<ref name="VANOC shrinks ice">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Olympics/2010Vancouver/2006/06/08/1620669-sun.html |title=VANOC shrinks Olympic ice|author=Mackin, Bob|date=June 6, 2006|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer|Slam! Sports]]|accessdate=January 7, 2009}}</ref> However, some European countries expressed concern over this decision, worried that it might give North American players an advantage since they grew up playing on the smaller NHL-sized rinks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/06/08/olympic-hockey-rinksize.html|title=2010 Olympic hockey will be NHL-sized |publisher=CBC News|date=June 8, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100127180626/http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/06/08/olympic-hockey-rinksize.html| archivedate=January 27, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> By contrast, the only other NHL venue to host Olympic hockey, the [[Calgary Flames]]' [[Olympic Saddledome]], started construction before Calgary won the bid for the 1988 Winter Olympics and it was designed to accommodate an international ice rink.

==Concerns and controversies==
{{Main|Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Winter Olympics}}
Initial organized opposition to the games began in 2006 with the creation of No Games 2010<ref name="2010 Olympic Games Watch homepage">{{cite web|url=http://2010watch.com/ |title=2010 Olympic Games Watch homepage |publisher=2010watch.com |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110128161133/http://2010watch.com/| archivedate=January 28, 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>{{Who|date=April 2010}} as outlined in Chris Shaw's book ''Five Ring Circus'' published in 2008.<ref name="2010 Olympic Games Watch homepage"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsociety.com/bookid/3995 |title=New Society Publishers – Five Ring Circus |publisher=Newsociety.com |date=July 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 1, 2010}}</ref>

Some in the foreign press, including London 2012 organizers, had criticized the lack of city decorations to acknowledge that Vancouver was the host of the Games. The original plans to decorate the city in Olympic colours, a tradition followed by other recent Games host cities, were canceled for several reasons. Anti-Games activists repeatedly vandalized the existing 2010 Olympics monuments such as the countdown clock, forcing the city to install CCTV cameras, and adding more Games decorations would have inevitably required more security presence to deter protesters, so VANOC opted to minimize these symbols to avoid making the city a police state. Besides local opposition, budget cutbacks also forced the organizers to scale back on the elaborate plans.<ref name="vancitybuzz1">[http://www.vancitybuzz.com/2013/02/three-years-later-a-reflection-on-the-vancouver-2010-olympic-games/ Four years later, a reflection on the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Games].

VANOC initially benefited from an economic boom and was able to secure lucrative and record domestic sponsorships, however this boom period also suffered from rapidly rising construction and labour costs. Due to these factors, as well as the late 2000s financial crisis and economic recession, VANOC build minimalistic functional venues with little aesthetic appeal though they were well-designed for post-Games usage. This approach, as well as the fact that most of the infrastructure already existed, meant that the direct costs of the Vancouver Games were much lower than recent Olympic editions.<ref name=vancitybuzz1/>

Before the Games began and as they commenced, a number of concerns and controversies surfaced and received media attention.  Hours before the opening ceremony, Georgian [[luge]]r [[Nodar Kumaritashvili]] was killed during a training run, intensifying questions about the safety of the course and prompting<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/king/news/newsid=428729.html |title=Women's downhill crashes prompt safety change to course &#124; NBC Olympics &#124; Olympic Zone |publisher=NBC Olympics |year=2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708033338/http://www.nbcolympics.com/king/news/newsid=428729.html |archivedate=July 8, 2012 }}</ref> organizers to implement quick modifications.

Although the [[Lil'wat]] branch of the [[St'at'imc Nation]] is a co-host of the Games, a splinter group from the [[Seton Lake First Nation|Seton]] band known as the St’at’imc of Sutikalh, who have also opposed the Cayoosh Ski Resort, feared the Olympics would bring unwanted tourism and real estate sales to their territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warriorpublications.com/?q=node/22|title=Sutikalh Re-occupation Camp| accessdate=January 25, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.dominionpaper.ca/articles/1738 |title=It’s all about the Land|publisher=The Dominion| accessdate=January 25, 2011 }}</ref>

Local aboriginal people, as well as Canadian [[Inuit]], initially expressed concern over the choice of an [[inukshuk]] as the symbol of the Games, with some Inuit leaders such as former [[Nunavut]] Commissioner [[Peter Irniq]] stating that the inukshuk is a culturally important symbol to them. He said that the "Inuit never build inuksuit with head, legs and arms. I have seen inuksuit [built] more recently, 100 years maybe by non-Inuit in Nunavut, with head, legs and arms. These are not called inuksuit. These are called [[inunguat]], imitation of man."<ref>{{cite news |title=Olympic inukshuk irks Inuit leader |publisher=[[CBC.ca]] Sports |date=April 27, 2005 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2005/04/26/olympic-logo050426.html |accessdate=August 13, 2008}}</ref> Local aboriginal groups also expressed annoyance that the design did not reflect the [[Coast Salish peoples|Coast Salish]] and [[Interior Salish]] native culture from the region the Games are being held in, but rather that of the Inuit, who are indigenous to the Arctic far from Vancouver.

===Doping===
On March 11, 2010, it was reported that the Polish cross country skier [[Kornelia Marek]] was tested positive for [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] by the [[Polish Olympic Committee]]. If found guilty of doping by the International Olympic Committee, Marek and the relay teams would be disqualified and stripped of their Vancouver results. She would also be banned from the [[2014 Winter Olympics|next Winter Olympics]] in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]], in 2014.

Marek denied taking any banned substances, but the backup "B" sample from the Vancouver doping lab confirmed the "A" sample.<ref>[http://wayback.archive.org/web/20100318025712/http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jes9QFNtEQg_moCp_Y3LNuLOsU0w Polish cross-country skier Marek tests positive for EPO at Vancouver Olympics]</ref>

===Funding===
Directly as a result of Canada's medal performance at the 2010 Olympics, the [[Government of Canada]] announced in the [[2010 Canadian federal budget|2010 federal budget]], a new commitment of $34 million over the next two years towards programs for athletes planning to compete in future Olympics.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/More+cash+podium+program/2644957/story.html |title=More cash for Own the Podium |date=March 4, 2010 |work=[[Vancouver Sun]] |publisher=Canwest Publishing |accessdate=March 5, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025113632/http://www.vancouversun.com/news/More+cash+podium+program/2644957/story.html |archivedate=October 25, 2012 }}</ref>  This is in addition to the $11 million per year federal government commitment to the [[Own the Podium]] program.

Also, as a result of hosting the 2010 Olympics, the [[British Columbia government]] pledged to restore funding for sports programs and athlete development to 2008 levels, which amounts to $30 million over three years.<ref>{{cite news
