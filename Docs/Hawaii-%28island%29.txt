'''Hawai{{okina}}i''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ə|ˈ|w|aɪ|.|i}} or {{IPAc-en|h|ə|ˈ|w|ɑː|iː}}; {{IPA-haw|həˈvɐjʔi|lang}}), is the largest island located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]]. It is the largest and the southeastern-most of the [[Hawaiian islands]], a chain of [[volcanic island]]s in the [[North Pacific Ocean]]. With an area of {{convert|4,028|sqmi|km2}}, it is larger than all of the other islands in the [[archipelago]] combined and is the [[List of islands of the United States by area|largest island in the United States]]. The island of Hawaii is the third largest island in [[Polynesia]], behind the two main [[islands of New Zealand]].

The island is often referred to as the '''Island of Hawai{{okina}}i''',<ref>According to the [[Geographic Names Information System]], '''Island of Hawai{{okina}}i''' is the preferred name, see {{GNIS|365308|Island of Hawai{{Okina}}i}}.</ref> the '''Big Island''', or '''Hawai{{okina}}i Island''' to distinguish between the island and the state. It is [[:wiktionary:coterminous|coterminous]] with [[Hawaii County, Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i County]] and includes the Hilo Micropolitan Statistical Area.

As of the [[United States 2010 Census|2010 Census]] the population was 185,079.<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/15/15001.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref> The [[county seat]] and largest city is [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]. There are no [[Municipal corporation|incorporated cities]] in Hawai{{okina}}i County (see [[List of counties in Hawaii|Hawaii Counties]]).

==History==
{{main|History of Hawaii }}
[[File:Four-mile beach, Hilo, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|[[James Kealoha Beach]], "4-Mile Beach," in Hilo]]
Hawai{{okina}}i is said to have been named after [[Hawaiʻiloa]], the legendary [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] navigator who first discovered it. Other accounts attribute the name to the legendary realm of [[Hawaiki]], a place from which the Polynesian people are said to have originated (see also [[Manua]]), the place where they go in the afterlife, the realm of the gods and goddesses. The name is cognate with [[Savaii]], the name of the largest island of [[Samoa]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} Captain [[James Cook]], the English explorer and navigator who was the captain of the first European expedition that discovered the Hawaiian Islands, called them the "Sandwich Islands" after his patron, the Earl of Sandwich.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jarves|first=James Jackson|title=History of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BVJTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1&dq=%22Sandwich+Islands%22+Cook+named&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UapnU8eBJszxoATHqoKICw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Sandwich%20Islands%22%20Cook%20named&f=false|year=1843|publisher=Tappa et Dennet|page=1}}</ref> Cook was killed on the Big Island at [[Kealakekua Bay]] on 14 February 1779, in a mêlée which followed the theft of a ship's boat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/cook_captain_james.shtml |title=History - Captain James Cook |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref>

Hawai{{okina}}i was the home island of Pai{{okina}}ea Kamehameha, later known as [[Kamehameha I|Kamehameha the Great]]. Kamehameha united most of the Hawaiian islands under his rule in 1795, after several years of war, and gave the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|kingdom]] and the [[Hawaiian Islands|island chain]] the name of his native island.

==Geology and geography==
[[File:Hawaii-Big-Island-TF.jpg|thumb|Aerial view, 3D computer-generated image]]
According to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|5086|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|4028|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|1058|sqmi}} (20.8%) is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=23 April 2011|date=12 February 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> The county's land area comprises 62.7 percent of the state's land area. It is the highest percentage by any county in the United States. ([[Delaware]]'s [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]] comes in second at 48.0 percent, while [[Rhode Island]]'s [[Providence County, Rhode Island|Providence County]] is third at 39.55 percent.)

In greatest dimension, the island is {{convert|93|mi|km}} across and
has a land area of {{convert|4028|sqmi}}<ref name="SizeRef">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/economic/databook/db2004/section05.pdf |title=Table 5.08 – Land Area of Islands: 2000 |work= State of Hawaii Data Book |publisher=State of Hawaii | year=2004 | accessdate= 12 February 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> comprising 62% of the [[Hawaiian Islands]]' land area.

=== Volcanism ===
[[File:Location Hawaii Volcanoes.svg|thumb|The five shield volcanoes]]
[[File:Three Waikupanaha and one Ki lava ocean entries w-edit2.jpg|thumb|Steam plume as Kīlauea red lava enters the ocean at three Waikupanaha and one Ki lava ocean entries. Some surface lava is seen too. The image was taken on 16 April 2008.]]

The Island of Hawai{{okina}}i is built from five separate [[shield volcano]]es that erupted somewhat sequentially, one overlapping the other. These are (from oldest to youngest):
:*[[Kohala (mountain)|Kohala]]—extinct
:*[[Mauna Kea]]—dormant
:*[[Hualalai|Hualālai]]—active
:*[[Mauna Loa]]—active, partly within [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park]]
:*[[Kīlauea]]—active: has been erupting continuously since 1983; part of Hawai{{okina}}i Volcanoes National Park

Geological evidence from exposures of old surfaces on the south and west flanks of Mauna Loa led to the proposal that two ancient volcanic shields (named Ninole and Kulani) were all but buried by the younger Mauna Loa.<ref>{{cite book |first=G. A. |last=MacDonald |first2=A. T. |last2=Abbott |year=1970 |title=Volcanoes in the Sea |publisher=University of Hawai{{okina}}i Press |location=Honolulu |isbn=0870224956 }}</ref>  Geologists now consider these "outcrops" to be part of the earlier building of Mauna Loa. Another volcano which has already disappeared below the surface of the ocean is [[Māhukona]].

Because Mauna Loa and Kīlauea are active volcanoes, the island of Hawaii is still growing. Between January 1983 and September 2002, [[lava]] flows added {{convert|543|acre|ha}} to the island. Lava flowing from Kīlauea has destroyed several towns, including [[Kapoho, Hawaii|Kapoho]] in 1960, and [[Kalapana, HI|Kalapana]] and [[Kaimu]] in 1990. In 1987 lava filled in ''Queen's Bath'', a large, L-shaped, freshwater pool in the Kalapana area.

The [[extreme points of the United States|southmost point]] in the 50 [[States of the United States]], [[Ka Lae]], is on Hawaii. The nearest landfall to the south is in the [[Line Islands]]. To the north of the Island of Hawaii is the Island of [[Maui]], whose [[Haleakala]] volcano is visible from Hawaii across the [[Hawaiian islands channels|Alenuihaha Channel]].

Approximately {{convert|35|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Hawaii lies the [[submarine volcano|undersea volcano]] known as [[Loihi Seamount|Loihi]]. Loihi is an erupting seamount that now reaches approximately {{convert|3200|ft|m}} below the surface of the ocean. Continued activity at current rates from Loihi will likely cause it to break the surface of the ocean sometime from 10,000 to 100,000 years from now.

=== The Great Crack ===
[[File:Lava enering ocean5n.jpg|thumb|Lava entering the Pacific at [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]] in April 2005, increasing the size of the island.|alt=Photo showing clouds of steam surrounding lava that is partly black and partly glowing orange]]
The Great Crack is an {{Convert|8|mi|km|adj=mid|-long|spell=in}}, {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide|sigfig=2}} and {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=mid|-deep|sigfi=2}} fissure in the island, in the district of [[Kau, Hawaii|Kau]]. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), The Great Crack is the result of crustal dilation from magmatic intrusions into the southwest rift zone of Kilauea.<ref name="USGS_Great_Crack">[http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1998/98_07_16.html ''Are We Breaking Away – The Great Crack''], USGS, 16 July 1998.</ref> While neither the [[1868 Hawaii earthquake|earthquake of 1868]] nor that of 1975 caused a measurable change in The Great Crack, lava welled out of the lower {{convert|10|km|mi|sp=us|disp=flip}} of the Great Crack in 1823.<ref name="USGS_Great_Crack" />

Visitors can find trails, rock walls, and archaeological sites from as old as the 12th century around the Great Crack. Approximately {{convert|1951|acre|km2}} of private land were purchased during the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton]], specifically to protect various artifacts in this area as well as the habitat of local wildlife.

=== The Hilina Slump ===

=== Earthquakes and tsunamis ===
[[File:BI Beach.JPG|thumb|Big Island Beach]]
[[File:Anaeho'omalu Panorama.JPG|thumb|Anaeho'omalu Beach Panorama]]
On [[1868 Hawaii earthquake|2 April 1868, an earthquake]] with a magnitude estimated between 7.25 and 7.9 on the Richter scale rocked the southeast coast of Hawaii. This was the most destructive earthquake in the recorded history  of Hawaii.<ref name="Destructive Earthquakes">Hawaiian Volcano Observatory (26 October 2006) [http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/earthquakes/destruct/ "Destructive Earthquakes in Hawai`i County Since 1868"]. Retrieved 21 March 2012</ref>  It triggered a landslide on Mauna Loa, {{Convert|5|mi|km|spell=in}} north of [[Pahala, HI|Pahala]], killing 31 people.  A [[tsunami]] claimed 46 more lives. The villages of [[Punaluu Beach|Punaluu]], [[Ninole]], Kawaa, Honuapo, and Keauhou Landing were severely damaged. The tsunami reportedly rolled over the tops of the coconut trees up to {{convert|60|ft|m|0}} high, and it reached inland a distance of a quarter of a mile (0.4&nbsp;km) in some places.<ref>{{cite book |title= Tsunami! |year=1998 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |author=Walter C. Dudley |edition= second |isbn=978-0-8248-1969-9 |pages=222–224 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IpuAAAAAMAAJ }}</ref>

On 29 November 1975, a {{convert|37|mi|km|adj=mid|-wide|sigfig=2}} section of the [[Hilina Slump]] dropped {{Convert|11.5|ft|m}} and slid {{convert|26|ft|m}} toward the ocean. This movement caused a 7.2 magnitude earthquake and a {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=mid|-high|sigfif=2}} tsunami. Oceanfront property was washed off its foundations in Punaluu. Two deaths were reported at Halape, and 19 other people were injured.

The island suffered tsunami damage from earthquakes in [[Alaska]] on 1 April 1946, and in [[Chile]] on 23 May 1960. Downtown Hilo was severely damaged by  both tsunamis, with many lives lost.  Just north of Hilo, [[Laupahoehoe]] lost 16 schoolchildren and five teachers in the tsunami of 1946.

In March 2011, a [[2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami|9.0 magnitude earthquake]] off the east coast of Japan again created a tsunami that caused minor damage in Hawaii. The estimated damage to public buildings alone was about $3 million.<ref name="2011 Sendai">Nakaso, Dan (14 March 2011) [http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/117965429.html "Tsunami damage estimate for Hawaii now tens of millions"]. ''Star Advertiser'', Retrieved 15 March 2011</ref>  In the Kona area this tsunami washed a house into Kealakekua Bay, destroyed a yacht club and tour boat offices in Keauhou Bay, caused extensive damage in Kailua Kona, flooded the ground floor of the King Kamehameha Hotel,<ref>{{cite web|title=King Kamehameha Hotel is new and improved after last year's tsunami|url=http://www.khon2.com/content/news/editorschoice/story/King-Kamehameha-Hotel-is-new-and-improved-after/BY0_zuu2PESqeWpS4w5gnQ.cspx|publisher=KHON2|accessdate=1 April 2012}}</ref> and permanently closed the Kona Village Resort.

=== Volcanic fog ===
[[Vog]] (volcanic fog) can envelop the island. The gas plumes of the Kīlauea Volcano create a blanket of vog which the dominant [[trade winds]] mostly deflect toward the Kona coast on the west side of the Island of Hawaiʻi. Vog contains chemicals that can damage the environment, and the health of plants, humans and other animals. Most of the aerosols are acidic and of a size where they can remain in the lungs to damage the lungs and impair function. Flu-like symptoms and general lethargy are reported, especially pronounced in people with respiratory conditions.<ref name="Frequently Asked Questions about Air Quality in Hawaiʻi">[http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/hazards/FAQ_SO2-Vog-Ash/P1.html] on USGS web site.

== Government and infrastructure ==

=== County government===
[[Hawaii County, Hawaii]], encompasses the entire island of Hawaii. Executive authority is vested in the [[Mayor of Hawaii County]] who is elected for a four-year term. Since 2004, the election by the voters has been on a non-partisan basis. In 2008, [[Billy Kenoi]] was elected Mayor, succeeding [[Harry Kim (politician)|Harry Kim]] who had served a two-term limit.<ref>{{cite web |title= Office of the Mayor |publisher= County of Hawaii |work= official web site |url= http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/directory/dir_mayors.htm |accessdate= 27 March 2010 }}</ref> Legislative authority is vested in a nine-member County Council. Each member represents a geographical region of the island, which closely correlates to one of the nine tax map districts of Hawai{{okina}}i County. Members of the County Council are elected on a non-partisan basis to two-year terms, with the latest election occurring in November 2010.

Administrative districts were originally based on the traditional land divisions called ''Moku'' of [[Ancient Hawaii]]. Some of the more heavily populated districts have since been split into North and South districts to make them more comparable on a population basis.

The number following each district is the Tax Map Key (TMK) number, used to locate state property information. They are assigned in a counter-clockwise order beginning on the eastern side of the island.<ref>[http://co.hawaii.hi.us/databook_2008/Table%201/1.7.pdf Hawaii County: 2000]</ref>

County council districts do not directly match the property tax districts because of the variation in the population density of voters in urban areas to rural areas; Hilo & Kailua (Kailua-Kona) towns are densely populated areas, while other districts such as Ka{{okina}}ū, Puna, Hāmakua, and North & South Kohala are more sparsely populated.<ref>{{cite web |title= Hawai{{okina}}i County Council |work= official web site |url= http://www.co.hawaii.hi.us/council/districts.htm |accessdate= 27 March 2010}}</ref>

Several government functions are administered at the county level that are at the state or municipal level in other states. For example, the county has its own office of liquor control.<ref>{{cite web |title= Office of Liquor Control |work= Hawaii County web site |url= http://www.hawaii-county.com/directory/dir_liquor.htm |accessdate= 25 December 2010}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:BigIslandBeach3.JPG|thumb|Kohala Coast Beach on the Big Island]]
[[File:AerialCyanotechW.jpg|thumbnail|right|Aerial view of Cyanotech Corp. microalgae ponds at NELHA.]]
[[Sugarcane]] was the backbone of Hawai{{okina}}i Island's [[Economic system|economy]] for more than a century.   In the mid-twentieth century, sugarcane [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]]s began to downsize and in 1996, the last plantation closed.

Most of Hawai{{okina}}i Island's economy is based on [[Tourism in Hawaii|tourism]], centered primarily in resort areas on the western coast of the island in the North [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]] and South [[Kohala, Hawaii|Kohala]] districts. More recently, Hawai{{okina}}i Island has become a focus for [[sustainable tourism]].

Diversified [[agriculture]] is a growing sector of the economy. Major crops include [[Macadamia|Macadamia nuts]], [[papaya]], [[flower]]s, [[tropical]] and [[temperate]] [[vegetable]]s, and [[coffee|coffee beans]]. Only coffee grown in the [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona District]] of this island may be branded [[Kona coffee]]. The island's [[orchid]] agriculture is the largest in the state, and resulted in the unofficial nickname "The Orchid Isle." The island is home to one of the United States' largest [[cattle ranch]]es: [[Parker Ranch]], on {{convert|175000|acre|km2|0}} in [[Waimea, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Waimea]]. Hawai{{okina}}i is also known for [[astronomy]], and numerous [[telescope]]s are operated on the summit of [[Mauna Kea]], where atmospheric clarity is excellent and there is little [[light pollution]].

[[NELHA]] (Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii Authority), a 675-acre state developed site, is a green economic development ocean science and technology park on the west side of the Hawaii island. It provides resources and facilities for energy and ocean-related research, education, and commercial activities in an environmentally sound and culturally sensitive manner. Business tenants on this unique{{peacock term|date=August 2014}} coastal site include microalgae farms, aquaculture, solar technology and marine biotech. Tenants have access to three sets of pipelines delivering deep sea water from a depth of up to 3000 feet, as well as pristine sea surface water and almost constant sunshine. NELHA is a success story for the State of Hawaii and the Big Island.  A 2012 study by the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization ([http://www.uhero.hawaii.edu/products/view/19 UHERO]) found the total economic impact of activities at NELHA was $87.7 million and created 583 jobs.<ref name="HERO on NELHA">{{Cite web |title=Economic Impact of the Natural Energy Laboratory Hawaii Authority Tenants on the State of Hawaii |author=University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization (UHERO)  |work=nelha.hawaii.gov |date=18 May 2012 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |url=http://nelha.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/NELHA-Tenants-Impact-Study-UHERO-2012_Color.pdf |publisher=[[University of Hawaii]] |location=Honolulu, HI}}</ref>

The island was traditionally divided into districts called ''moku''. The names of the districts are (counter-clockwise, from the southeast): [[Puna, Hawaii|Puna]], [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]], [[Hamakua, Hawaii|Hāmākua]], [[Kohala, Hawaii|Kohala]], [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]], and [[Kau, Hawaii|Ka{{okina}}ū]]. The county government subdivides some of these to form elective districts of the county council. There are no incorporated municipalities on the island.
