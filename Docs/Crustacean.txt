'''Crustaceans''' ('''Crustacea''' {{IPAc-en|k|r|ʌ|ˈ|s|t|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}) form a very large group of [[arthropod]]s, usually treated as a [[subphylum]], which includes such familiar animals as [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, [[crayfish]], [[Caridea|shrimp]], [[krill]] and [[barnacle]]s.
Thanks to recent molecular studies, it is now well accepted that the crustacean group comprises all animals in the Pancrustacea clade other than hexapods.<ref name="Rota-Stabelli2010">{{cite journal |author=Omar Rota-Stabelli, Ehsan Kayal, Dianne Gleeson, Jennifer Daub, Jeffrey L. Boore, Maximilian J. Telford, Davide Pisani, Mark Blaxter & Dennis V. Lavrov |year=2010 |title=Ecdysozoan Mitogenomics: Evidence for a Common Origin of the Legged Invertebrates, the Panarthropoda |journal=[[Genome Biology and Evolution]] |volume=2 |pages=425–440 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evq030 |pmid=20624745 |url=http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/425 |pmc=2998192}}</ref>
In other words, some crustaceans are more closely related to insects and other hexapods than they are to certain other crustaceans. 

The 67,000 described species range in size from ''[[Stygotantulus|Stygotantulus stocki]]'' at {{convert|0.1|mm|3|abbr=on}}, to the [[Japanese spider crab]] with a leg span of up to {{convert|3.8|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} and a mass of {{convert|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.  Like other [[arthropod]]s, crustaceans have an [[exoskeleton]], which they [[ecdysis|moult]] to grow. They are distinguished from other groups of arthropods, such as [[insect]]s, [[Myriapoda|myriapods]] and [[Chelicerata|chelicerates]], by the possession of [[biramous]] (two-parted) limbs, and by their [[crustacean larvae|larval forms]], such as the [[Nauplius (larva)|nauplius]] stage of [[branchiopod]]s and [[copepod]]s.

Most crustaceans are free-living [[aquatic animal]]s, but some are [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] (e.g. [[woodlouse|woodlice]]), some are [[Parasitism|parasitic]] (e.g. [[Rhizocephala]], [[Argulidae|fish lice]], [[Pentastomida|tongue worms]]) and some are [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] (e.g. [[barnacle]]s). The group has an extensive [[fossil record]], reaching back to the [[Cambrian]], and includes [[living fossil]]s such as ''[[Triops cancriformis]]'', which has existed apparently unchanged since the [[Triassic]] period. More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being [[shrimp and prawn]]s. [[Krill]] and [[copepod]]s are not as widely fished, but may be the animals with the greatest [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] on the planet, and form a vital part of the food chain. The scientific study of crustaceans is known as [[carcinology]] (alternatively, ''malacostracology'', ''crustaceology'' or ''crustalogy''), and a [[scientist]] who works in carcinology is a [[List of carcinologists|carcinologist]].

Each [[somite]], or body segment can bear a pair of [[appendage]]s: on the segments of the head, these include two pairs of [[antenna (biology)|antennae]], the [[Mandible (arthropod mouthpart)|mandible]]s and [[Maxilla (arthropod mouthpart)|maxilla]]e;<ref name="cephalon"/> the thoracic segments bear [[arthropod leg|legs]], which may be specialised as [[pereiopod]]s (walking legs) and [[maxilliped]]s (feeding legs).<ref name="thorax"/> The abdomen bears [[pleopod]]s,<ref name="abdomen"/> and ends in a [[telson]], which bears the [[anus]], and is often flanked by uropods to form a [[Decapod anatomy|tail fan]].<ref name="telson">{{cite web |url=http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html?term=Telson |title=Telson |work=Crustacean Glossary |publisher=[[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] |accessdate=February 26, 2010}}</ref> The number and variety of [[appendage]]s in different crustaceans may be partly responsible for the group's success.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |year=1997 |volume=277 |issue=5322 |pages=36 |doi=10.1126/science.277.5322.36 |title=Crab legs and lobster claws |author=Elizabeth Pennisi}}</ref>

Crustacean [[appendage]]s are typically [[biramous]], meaning they are divided into two parts; this includes the second pair of antennae, but not the first, which is usually [[uniramous]], the exception being in the Class Malacostraca where the antennules may be generally biramous or even triramous.<ref name="antennule">{{cite web |url=http://crustacea.nhm.org/glossary/define.html?term=Antennule |title=Antennule |work=Crustacean Glossary |publisher=[[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County]] |accessdate=16 May 2014}}</ref>

In many [[Decapoda|decapods]], the first (and sometimes the second) pair of pleopods are specialised in the male for sperm transfer. Many terrestrial crustaceans (such as the [[Christmas Island red crab]]) mate seasonally and return to the sea to release the eggs. Others, such as [[woodlouse|woodlice]], lay their eggs on land, albeit in damp conditions. In most decapods, the females retain the eggs until they hatch into free-swimming larvae.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Burkenroad, M.

==Ecology==
The majority of crustaceans are aquatic, living in either marine or [[fresh water|freshwater]] environments, but a few groups have [[adaptation|adapted]] to life on land, such as [[terrestrial crab]]s, [[Coenobita|terrestrial hermit crabs]], and [[woodlouse|woodlice]].

===Eggs===
In many groups of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply released into the [[water column]], while others have developed a number of mechanisms for holding on to the eggs until they are ready to hatch. Most [[Decapoda|decapods]] carry the eggs attached to the [[pleopod]]s, while [[Peracarida|peracarids]], [[notostraca]]ns, [[anostraca]]ns, and many [[isopod]]s form a [[Brood pouch (Peracarida)|brood pouch]] from the [[carapace]] and thoracic limbs.<ref name="Britannica"/> Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects.<ref name="NorAmFWI">{{cite book |editor1=James H.

===Larvae===
{{main|Crustacean larvae}}
Crustaceans exhibit a number of larval forms, of which the earliest and most characteristic is the [[nauplius (larva)|nauplius]]. This has three pairs of [[appendage]]s, all emerging from the young animal's head, and a single naupliar eye. In most groups, there are further larval stages, including the [[zoea]] (pl. zoeæ or zoeas<ref>{{OED|Zoea}}</ref>). This name was given to it when naturalists believed it to be a separate species.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Crab |chapter-url=http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Crab |author=William Thomas Calman |title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] |year=1911 |authorlink=William Thomas Calman}}</ref> It follows the [[nauplius (larva)|nauplius]] stage and precedes the [[post-larva]]. Zoea larvae swim with their thoracic [[appendage]]s, as opposed to nauplii, which use cephalic appendages, and megalopa, which use abdominal appendages for swimming. It often has spikes on its [[carapace]], which may assist these small organisms in maintaining directional swimming.<ref>{{cite journal |author=W. F. R. Weldon |authorlink = Raphael Weldon|year=1889 |title=Note on the function of the spines of the Crustacean zoœa |journal=[[Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=169–172 |url=http://sabella.mba.ac.uk/16/01/Note_on_the_Function_of_the_Spines_of_the_Crustacean_Zooea.pdf | doi=10.1017/S0025315400057994}}</ref> In many [[Decapoda|decapods]], due to their accelerated development, the zoea is the first larval stage. In some cases, the zoea stage is followed by the mysis stage, and in others, by the megalopa stage, depending on the crustacean group involved.

==Classification==
The name "crustacean" dates from the earliest works to describe the animals, including those of [[Pierre Belon]] and [[Guillaume Rondelet]], but the name was not used by some later authors, including [[Carl Linnaeus]], who included crustaceans among the "[[Aptera in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae|Aptera]]" in his ''{{lang|la|[[Systema Naturae]]}}''.<ref name="MLW">{{cite book |url=http://nlbif.eti.uva.nl/bis/lobsters.php?selected=foto&menuentry=inleiding&record=Classification<!--http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/t0411e/t0411e00.HTM--> |chapter=Introduction |pages=1–2 |series=FAO Species Catalogue, Volume 13 |title=Marine Lobsters of the World |author=Lipke B.

==Consumption by humans==
Many crustaceans are consumed by humans, and nearly 10,700,000&nbsp;[[ton]]s were produced in 2007; the vast majority of this output is of [[Decapoda|decapod crustaceans]]: [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, [[shrimp]], [[crawfish]], and [[Dendrobranchiata|prawns]].<ref name="FAO">{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/TabLandArea?tb_ds=Production&tb_mode=TABLE&tb_act=SELECT&tb_grp=COUNTRY |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=February 24, 2010 |title=FIGIS: Global Production Statistics 1950–2007}}</ref> Over 60% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns, and nearly 80% is produced in Asia, with China alone producing nearly half the world's total.<ref name="FAO"/> Non-decapod crustaceans are not widely consumed, with only 118,000&nbsp;tons of [[krill]] being caught,<ref name="FAO"/> despite krill having one of the greatest [[Biomass (ecology)|biomasses]] on the planet.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Steven Nicol |author2=Yoshinari Endo |url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/W5911E/W5911E00.HTM |series=Fisheries Technical Paper |volume=367 |title=Krill Fisheries of the World |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=1997 |isbn=978-92-5-104012-6}}</ref>
