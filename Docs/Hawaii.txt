It is the northernmost island group in [[Polynesia]], occupying most of an archipelago in the central [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name="boehonbcn"></ref> Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the [[Americas]]. The state does not observe [[daylight saving time]].

The state encompasses nearly the entire volcanic [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian archipelago]], which comprises hundreds of islands spread over {{convert|1500|mi|adj=j}}. At the southeastern end of the archipelago, the eight main islands are—in order from northwest to southeast: [[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]], [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]], [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]], [[Lanai|Lāna{{okina}}i]], [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{okina}}olawe]], [[Maui]] and the [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The last is the largest island in the group; it is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawai{{okina}}i Island" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. The archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.

Hawaii's diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists. Because of its central location in the Pacific and 19th-century labor migration, Hawaii's culture is strongly influenced by North American and Asian cultures, in addition to its [[Native Hawaiians|indigenous Hawaiian]] culture. Hawaii has over a million permanent residents, along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel. Its capital is [[Honolulu]] on the island of O{{okina}}ahu.

Hawaii is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|8th-smallest]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|11th-least populous]], but the [[List of U.S. states by population density|13th-most densely populated]] of the fifty U.S. states. It is the only state with an [[Asian American|Asian]] [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]]. The state's coastline is about {{convert|750|mi|km|adj=j}} long, the [[List of U.S. states by coastline|fourth longest in the U.S.]] after the coastlines of Alaska, Florida and California.

==Etymology==
The state of Hawaii derives its name from the name of its largest island, [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]]. A common Hawaiian explanation of the name of Hawai{{okina}}i is that was named for [[Hawaiiloa|Hawai{{okina}}iloa]], a legendary figure from Hawaiian myth. He is said to have discovered the islands when they were first settled.<ref>[http://www.ethnomath.org/resources/cartwright1929.pdf The legend of Hawaiiloa by Bruce Cartwright]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiischoolreports.com/symbols/origins.htm |title=Origins of Hawaii's Names |accessdate=February 24, 2007}}</ref>

The [[Hawaiian language]] word ''Hawai{{okina}}i'' is very similar to [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''Sawaiki'', with the [[Internal reconstruction|reconstructed]] meaning "homeland".<ref>Pollex—a reconstruction of the Proto-Polynesian lexicon, Biggs and Clark, 1994. The asterisk preceding the word signifies that it is a reconstructed word form.</ref> [[Cognate]]s of ''Hawai{{okina}}i'' are found in other Polynesian languages, including [[Māori language|Māori]] (''[[Hawaiki]]''), [[Cook Islands Maori|Rarotongan]] (''ʻAvaiki'') and [[Samoan language|Samoan]] (''[[Savai'i|Savai{{okina}}i]]'') . According to linguists Pukui and Elbert,<ref>{{Cite book | last1 = Pukui | first1 = Mary Kawena | first2 = Samuel H. | last2 = Elbert | title = Hawaiian Dictionary | location = Honolulu | publisher=University of Hawaii Press | year = 1986 | isbn = 0-8248-0703-0|page=62}}</ref> "[e]lsewhere in Polynesia, Hawai{{okina}}i or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home, but in Hawaii, the name has no meaning".<ref>Pukui, Elbert, and Mookini 1974.</ref>

===Spelling of state name===
A somewhat divisive political issue arose in 1978 when the Constitution of the State of Hawaii added Hawaiian as a second official state language.<ref>{{cite web |title=Article{{nbsp}}XV, Section{{nbsp}}4 |work=The Constitution of the State of Hawaii |publisher=Hawaii Legislative Reference Bureau |url=http://lrbhawaii.org/con/conart15.html |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> The title of the state constitution is ''The Constitution of the State of Hawaii''. Article{{nbsp}}XV, Section{{nbsp}}1 of the Constitution uses ''The State of Hawaii''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Article{{nbsp}}XV, Section{{nbsp}}1 |work=The Constitution of the State of Hawaii |publisher=Hawaii Legislative Reference Bureau |url=http://lrbhawaii.org/con/conart15.html |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> [[Diacritic]]s were not used because the document, drafted in 1949,<ref>{{cite web |title=The Constitution of the State of Hawaii |work=The Constitution of the State of Hawaii |publisher=Hawaii Legislative Reference Bureau |url=http://lrbhawaii.org/con/conorg.html |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref> predates the use of the [[ʻOkina|okina]] ({{okina}}) and the [[macron|kahakō]] in modern Hawaiian orthography. The exact spelling of the state's name in the islands' language is ''Hawai{{okina}}i''.{{efn|The [[ʻokina]], which resembles an apostrophe and precedes the final ''i'' in ''Hawai{{okina}}i'', is a consonant in Hawaiian and phonetically represents the [[glottal stop]] {{IPAc-en|ʔ}}.}} In the [[Hawaii Admission Act]] that granted Hawaiian statehood, the federal government recognized ''Hawaii'' as the official state name. Official government publications, as well as department and office titles, use the traditional Hawaiian spelling with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wowpolynesia.com/hawaiian-language/ |title=Hawaiian language |publisher=Wow Polynesia |date=December 2, 2009 |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}</ref> In contrast, the National and State Parks Services, the University of Hawai{{okina}}i and some private enterprises implement these symbols. A precedent for changes to U.S. state names was set in 1780 when the [[Massachusetts Bay State]] changed its name to the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] and in the 1820s when the [[Territory of Arkansaw]] changed the spelling of its name to the [[Territory of Arkansas]].

Hawaii, along with Alaska, does not border any other U.S. state. It is the only U.S. state that is not geographically located in North America, the only state completely surrounded by water and that is entirely an archipelago, and the only state in which coffee is cultivable.

In addition to the eight main islands, the state has many smaller islands and islets. [[Kaʻula|Ka{{okina}}ula]] is a small island near Ni{{okina}}ihau that is often overlooked. The [[Northwest Hawaiian Islands]] is a group of nine small, older islands to the northwest of Kaua{{okina}}i that extend from [[Nihoa]] to [[Kure Atoll]]; these are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains. Across the archipelago are around 130 small rocks and islets, such as [[Molokini]], which are either volcanic, marine sedimentary or erosional in origin.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/haw_volc.html |title=General Information about Hawaiian Shield Volcanoes| last=Rubin | first=Ken| accessdate=December 2009}}</ref>

===Geology===

{{main|Hawaii hotspot}}

[[File:Pāhoehoe lava meets Pacific.jpg|thumb|right|Pāhoehoe, or smooth lava, spills into the Pacific Ocean, forming new rock off the coast of the Island of Hawaii.]]

The Hawaiian islands were formed by volcanic activity initiated at an undersea [[magma]] source called the [[Hawaii hotspot]]. The process is continuing to build islands; the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] beneath much of the Pacific Ocean continually moves northwest and the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes. Because of the hotspot's location, all currently active land volcanoes are located on the southern half of Hawaii Island. The newest volcano, [[Loihi Seamount|Lō{{okina}}ihi Seamount]], is located south of the coast of Hawaii Island.

The last volcanic eruption outside Hawaii Island occurred at [[Haleakalā]] on Maui before the late 18th{{nbsp}}century, though it could have been hundreds of years earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_09_09.html |title = Youngest lava flows on East Maui probably older than A.D. 1790 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |date = September 9, 1999 |accessdate = May 5, 2015}}</ref> In 1790, [[1790 Footprints|Kīlauea exploded]]; it was the deadliest eruption known to have occurred in the modern era in what is now the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs074-97/ |title=Living on Acive Volcanoes—The Island of Hawaii, U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 074-97 |publisher=Pubs.usgs.gov|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref> Up to 5,405 warriors and their families marching on [[Kīlauea]] were killed by the eruption.<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Swanson, D.

===Flora and fauna===
{{See also|Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands}}
[[File:Corvus hawaiiensis.jpg|thumb|upright|''Corvus hawaiiensis'', the endemic [[Hawaiian crow]] ({{okina}}alalā), is extinct in the wild.]]

Because the islands of Hawaii are distant from other land habitats, life is thought to have arrived there by wind, waves (i.e. by ocean currents) and wings (i.e. birds, insects, and any seeds they may have carried on their feathers).

The extant main islands of the archipelago have been above the surface of the ocean for fewer than 10{{nbsp}}million years; a fraction of the time biological colonization and evolution have occurred there. The islands are well known for the environmental diversity that occurs on high mountains within a trade winds field. On a single island, the climate around the coasts can range from dry tropical (less than {{convert|20|in|mm|disp=or|adj=j}} annual rainfall) to wet tropical; on the slopes, envionments range from tropical rainforest (more than {{convert|200|in|mm|disp=or|adj=j}} per year), through a temperate climate, to alpine conditions with a cold, dry climate. The rainy climate impacts soil development, which largely determines ground permeability, affecting the distribution of streams and wetlands.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Several areas in Hawaii are under the protection of the [[National Park Service]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Hawaii | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate = July 15, 2008 | url = http://www.nps.gov/state/HI}}</ref> Hawaii has two national parks: [[Haleakala National Park]] located near [[Kula, Hawaii|Kula]] on the island of Maui, which features the dormant volcano Haleakalā that formed east Maui, and [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]] in the southeast region of the Hawai{{okina}}i Island, which includes the active volcano Kīlauea and its rift zones.

There are three [[national historical park]]s; [[Kalaupapa National Historical Park]] in Kalaupapa, Moloka{{okina}}i, the site of a former leper colony; [[Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park|Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]] on Hawai{{okina}}i Island; and [[Puʻuhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park|Pu{{okina}}uhonua o Hōnaunau National Historical Park]], an ancient place of refuge on Hawai{{okina}}i Island's west coast.

The [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]] was proclaimed by President [[George W. Bush]] on June 15, 2006. The monument covers roughly {{convert|140000|mi2|km2|adj=j}} of reefs, atolls, and shallow and deep sea out to {{convert|50|mi|km|-1|adj=j}} offshore in the Pacific Ocean—an area larger than all of the national parks in the U.S. combined.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/ideas/ideas_item.cfm?content_item_id=3417&content_type_id=15&issue_name=Protecting%20ocean%20life&issue=16&page=15&name=Op-eds%20%28Pew%29| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930183659/http://www.pewtrusts.org/ideas/ideas_item.cfm?content_item_id=3417&content_type_id=15&issue_name=Protecting%20ocean%20life&issue=16&page=15&name=Op-eds%20%28Pew%29| archivedate=September 30, 2006| title=Treasure Islands| author=Joshua Reichert and [[Theodore Roosevelt IV]]  | date=June 15, 2006}}</ref>

[[File:Hawaje-NoRedLine.jpg|thumb|A true-color satellite view of Hawaii shows that most of the vegetation on the islands grows on the northeast sides which face the wind. The silver glow around the southwest of the islands is the result of calmer waters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=3510 |title=Hawaiian Islands : Image of the Day |publisher=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov |accessdate=November 5, 2010}}</ref>]]

Hawaii's climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be less extreme because of near-constant [[trade winds]] from the east. Summer highs usually reach around {{Convert|88|F|C}} during the day and {{Convert|75|F|C}} at night. Winter day temperatures are usually around {{Convert|83|F|C}}; at low elevation they seldom dip below {{Convert|65|F|C}} at night. Snow, not usually associated with the tropics, falls at {{convert|4200|m|ft|order=flip|adj=j}} on Mauna Kea and [[Mauna Loa]] on Hawaii Island in some winter months. Snow rarely falls on Haleakalā. [[Mount Waialeale|Mount Wai{{okina}}ale{{okina}}ale]] on Kaua{{okina}}i has the second-highest average annual rainfall on Earth, about {{convert|460|in|mm|adj=j}} per year. Most of Hawaii experiences only two seasons; the dry season runs from May to October and the wet season is from October to April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/pages/climate_summary.php |title=Climate of Hawaii |publisher=Prh.noaa.gov|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref>

The warmest temperature recorded in the state, in [[Pahala]] on April 27, 1931, is {{convert|100|°F|adj=j}}, making it tied with [[Alaska]] as the lowest record high temperature observed in a U.S. state{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. Hawaii's record low temperature is {{convert|12|°F|adj=j}} observed in May{{nbsp}}1979 on the summit of Mauna Kea. Hawaii is the only state to have never recorded sub-zero Fahrenheit temperatures.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Climates vary considerably on each island; they can be divided into [[windward and leeward]] (''ko{{okina}}olau'' and ''kona'', respectively) areas based upon location relative to the higher mountains. Windward sides face cloud cover.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Antipodes===
Hawaii is the only U.S. state that is [[antipodes|antipodal]] to inhabited land. Most of the state lies opposite Botswana, though Ni{{okina}}ihau's antipode aligns with Namibia, and Kaua{{okina}}i's straddles the Botswana–Namibia border. This area of Africa near [[Maun, Botswana]] and [[Ghanzi]] includes nature reserves and small settlements near the [[Okavango Delta]].<ref name="The World">{{cite web |url= http://www.pri.org/theworld/node/7751 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121103112951/http://www.pri.org/theworld/node/7751 |archivedate= November 3, 2012 |title=Today's Geo Quiz: Antipodes |work=[[The World (radio program)|The World]] |quote=So name Hawaii's antipode if you can... |publisher=[[Public Radio International]] |location=Boston, MA, USA |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref><ref name="findlatitudeandlongitude">{{cite web |url= http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/antipode-map/#.UFvhkK4q5yV |title=Antipode Map (AKA Tunnel Map) |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Hawaii}}
{{HI history}}
Hawaii is one of four U.S. states—apart from the original thirteen—the [[Vermont Republic]] (1791), the [[Republic of Texas]] (1845), and the [[California Republic]] (1846)—that were independent nations prior to statehood. Along with Texas, Hawaii had formal, international [[diplomatic recognition]] as a nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode20/usc_sec_20_00007512----000-.html |title=United States Code: Title 20,7512. Findings &#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref>

The [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] was sovereign from 1810 until 1893 when [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|the monarchy was overthrown]] by resident American and European capitalists and landholders in a ''[[coup d'état]]''. Hawaii was an independent republic from 1894 until August 12, 1898, when it officially became a territory of the United States. Hawaii was admitted as a U.S. state on August 21, 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/government/hi_government.htm |title=Hawaii State Government |publisher=Netstate.com|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref>

===First human settlement – Ancient Hawai{{okina}}i (800–1778)===
{{Main|Ancient Hawaii}}

Based on archaeological evidence, the earliest habitation of the Hawaiian Islands dates to around 300 CE, probably by Polynesian settlers from the [[Marquesas Islands]]. A second wave of migration from [[Raiatea]] and [[Bora Bora]] took place in the {{ordinal|11}} century. The date of the human discovery and habitation of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of academic debate.<ref>{{cite book
 | first = Patrick Vinton | last = Kirch | authorlink = Patrick Vinton Kirch | title = The Evolution of the Polynesian Chiefdoms | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year = 1989 | pages = 77–79 | isbn = 0-521-27316-1}}</ref> Some archaeologists and historians believe there was an early settlement from the Marquesas. They think it was a later wave of immigrants from [[Tahiti]] around 1000 CE who introduced a new line of high chiefs, the [[kapu]] system, the practice of human sacrifice, and the building of ''[[heiau]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} This later immigration is detailed in [[Hawaiian mythology]] (''mo{{okina}}olelo'') about [[Pa'ao|Pa{{okina}}ao]]. Other authors say there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of Tahitian settlers and that Pa{{okina}}ao must be regarded as a myth.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The history of the islands is marked by a slow, steady growth in population and the size of the [[chiefdoms]], which grew to encompass whole islands. Local chiefs, called [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]], ruled their settlements, and launched wars to extend their influence and defend their communities from predatory rivals. Ancient Hawaii was a [[Makaainana|caste]]-based society, much like that of Hindus in India.<ref>{{cite book | first = Barbara A. | last = West | year = 2009 | url = {{google books |plainurl=y|id=pCiNqFj3MQsC|page=270}} | title = Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania | publisher = Infobase Publishing | page = 270 | isbn = 1438119135}}</ref>

===European arrival===

[[File:Tereoboo, King of Owyhee, bringing presents to Captain Cook by John Webber.jpg|thumb|[[Kalaniʻōpuʻu]], King of Hawai{{okina}}i, brings presents to [[James Cook|Captain Cook]].|alt=Drawing of single-masted sailboat with one spinnaker-shaped sail, carrying dozens of men, accompanied by at least four other canoes.]]

It is possible that [[Conquistador|Spanish explorers]] arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in the 16th century—200 years before Captain [[James Cook]]'s first documented visit in 1778. [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] commanded a fleet of six ships that left [[Acapulco]] in 1542 bound for the Philippines with a Spanish sailor named Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports describe an encounter with either Hawai{{okina}}i or the Marshall Islands.<ref name=Kane>{{cite book| last = Kane| first = Herb Kawainui| authorlink = Herb Kawainui Kane| editor = Bob Dye| chapter = The Manila Galleons| title = Hawaii Chronicles: Island History from the Pages of Honolulu Magazine| volume = I| publisher = [[University of Hawaii Press]]| year = 1996| location = Honolulu| pages = 25–32| isbn = 0-8248-1829-6}}</ref> If de Villalobos' crew spotted Hawai{{okina}}i, Gaetano would be considered the first European to see the islands. Some scholars have dismissed these claims due to a lack of credibility.<ref>By Oliver, Douglas L. (1989). ''The Pacific Islands''. University of Hawaii Press. p. 45. ISBN 0-8248-1233-6</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Coulter | first1 = John Wesley | year = 1964 | title = Great Britain in Hawaii: The Captain Cook Monument | url = | journal = The Geographical Journal | volume = 130 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.2307/1794586}}</ref>

Spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands at the same latitude as Hawai{{okina}}i but with a longitude ten degrees east of the islands. In this manuscript, the island of Maui is named ''La Desgraciada'' (The Unfortunate Island), and what appears to be Hawai{{okina}}i Island is named ''La Mesa'' (The Table). Islands resembling Kahoolawe, Lanai, and Molokai are named ''Los Monjes'' (The Monks).<ref>{{cite web|publisher= Hawaii National Park |date=June 1959 |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/hawaii-notes/vol6-59h.htm |title=Hawai{{okina}}i Nature Notes}}</ref> For two-and-a-half centuries, [[Manila galleon|Spanish galleons]] crossed the Pacific from Mexico along a route that passed south of Hawai{{okina}}i on their way to [[Manila]]. The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers.

The 1778 arrival of British explorer [[James Cook]] was the first documented contact by a European explorer with Hawaii. Cook named the archipelago as the Sandwich Islands in honor of his sponsor [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]]. Cook published the islands' location and rendered the native name as ''Owyhee''. This spelling lives on in [[Owyhee County, Idaho|Owyhee County]], [[Idaho]]. It was named after three native Hawaiian members of a trapping party who went missing in that area. The Owyhee Mountains were also named for them.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Name Owyhee|url=http://www.history.idaho.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/reference-series/0036.pdf|publisher=Idaho State Historical Society|accessdate=January 1, 2015|date=August 1964}}</ref>

Cook visited the Hawaiian Islands twice. As he prepared for departure after his second visit in 1779, a quarrel ensued as Cook took temple idols and fencing as "firewood",<ref>Stanley D. Porteus, ''Calabashes and Kings: An Introduction to Hawaii.'' Kessinger Publishing, 2005; p. 17</ref> and a minor chief and his men took a ship's boat. Cook abducted the [[Alii Aimoku of Hawaii|King of Hawai{{okina}}i Island]], [[Kalaniʻōpuʻu|Kalani{{okina}}ōpu{{okina}}u]], and held him for ransom aboard his ship in order to gain return of Cook's boat. This tactic had worked in Tahiti and other islands.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kuykendall |title=The Hawaiian Kingdom Volume I: Foundation and Transformation |p=18 |quote=Cook's plan was to get the king on board the Resolution and keep him there until the stolen boat was returned—a plan that had been effective under similar circumstances in the south Pacific.}}</ref> Instead, Kalani{{okina}}ōpu{{okina}}u's supporters fought back, killing Cook and four marines as Cook's party retreated along the beach to their ship. They departed without the ship's boat.

After Cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian islands attracted  many European visitors: explorers, traders, and eventually whalers, who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies. Early British influence can be seen in the design of the [[Flag of Hawaii|flag of Hawai{{okina}}i]], which bears the [[Union Jack]] in the top-left corner. These visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands, causing the Hawaiian population to drop precipitously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/257332/Hawaii |title=Hawaii (state, United States) |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref> Native Hawaiians had no resistance to Eurasian diseases, such as [[influenza]], [[smallpox]] and [[measles]].

Historical records indicated the earliest Chinese immigrants to Hawaii originated from [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]]; a few sailors arrived in 1778 with Captain Cook's journey and more arrived in 1789 with an American trader, who settled in Hawaii in the late 18th century. It appears that leprosy was introduced by Chinese workers by 1830; as with the other new infectious diseases, it proved damaging to the Hawaiians.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i===
{{main|Kingdom of Hawaii}}

====House of Kamehameha====
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
[[File:Kamehameha I.png|thumb|upright|Kamehameha I conquered the Hawaiian Islands and established a unified monarchy across the archipelago.]]

During the 1780s and 1790s, chiefs often fought for power. After a series of battles that ended in 1795, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler, who became known as [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha the Great]]. He established the [[House of Kamehameha]], a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

After [[Kamehameha II]] inherited the throne in 1819, American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii converted many Hawaiians to Christianity. They used their influence to end many traditional practices of the people. {{which|date=March 2015}} The islands' first Christan king was [[Kamehameha III]].{{When|date=March 2015}}{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Hiram Bingham I]], a prominent Protestant missionary, was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period. Other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs, leading to conflicts between the monarchy and its restive American subjects.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Catholic and Mormon missionaries were also active in the kingdom, but they converted a minority of the Native Hawaiian population.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Missionaries from each major group administered to the leper colony at Kalaupapa on Moloka{{okina}}i, which was established in 1866 and operated well into the 20th century. The best known were [[Father Damien]] and [[Mother Marianne Cope]], both of whom were canonized in the early 21st century as Roman [[Catholic saints]].

The death of the bachelor [[Kamehameha V|King Kamehameha V]]—who did not name an heir—resulted in the popular election of [[Lunalilo]] over [[Kalākaua]]. Lunalilo died the next year, also without naming an heir. In 1874, the election was contested within the legislature between Kalākaua and [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Emma, Queen Consort of Kamehameha IV]]. After riots broke out, the United States and Britain landed troops on the islands to restore order. Governance passed to the [[House of Kalākaua]].{{clarify|date=March 2015}}

{{clear}}

====1887 Constitution and overthrow preparations====
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
In 1887, Kalākaua was forced to sign the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii]]. Drafted by white businessmen and lawyers, the document stripped the king of much of his authority. It established a property qualification for voting that effectively disenfranchised most Hawaiians and immigrant laborers and favored the wealthier, white elite. Resident whites were allowed to vote but resident Asians were not. Because the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence, it is known as the Bayonet Constitution. King Kalākaua, reduced to a figurehead, reigned until his death in 1891. His sister, Queen [[Liliuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], succeeded him; she was the last monarch of Hawai{{okina}}i.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1893, Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani announced plans for a new constitution. On January 14, 1893, a group of mostly Euro-American business leaders and residents formed the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] to stage a [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|coup d'état]] against the kingdom and seek annexation by the United States.

In January 1893, Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani was overthrown and replaced by a provisional government composed of members of the American Committee of Safety. American lawyer [[Sanford B. Dole]] became President of the Republic when the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] ended on July 4, 1894. Controversy ensued in the following years as the Queen tried to regain her throne. The administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]] commissioned the [[Blount Report]], which concluded that the removal of Lili{{okina}}uokalani had been illegal. The U.S. government first demanded that Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani be reinstated, but the Provisional Government refused.

Congress conducted an independent investigation, and on February 26, 1894, submitted the [[Morgan Report]], which found all parties, including Minister Stevens—with the exception of the Queen—"not guilty" and not responsible for the coup.<ref>{{cite book| author=Kuykendall, R.S. |year=1967 |title=The Hawaiian Kingdom, 1874–1893 |location=Honolulu |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |p=648}}</ref> Partisans on both sides of the debate questioned the accuracy and impartiality of both the Blount and Morgan reports over the events of 1893.<ref name="Adam"/><ref>{{cite book | last = Kinzer | first = Stephen | title = Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq | publisher=Times Books | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-8050-7861-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Hawaii Reporter |url=http://www.hawaiireporter.com/rush-limbaugh-sounds-off-on-akaka-bill/123| title=Rush Limbaugh Sounds Off on Akaka Bill |date=August 18, 2005}}</ref><ref name = "HDAICS">{{cite web |url=http://www.angelfire.com/hi5/bigfiles3/AkakaHawaiiDividedFeinJune2005.pdf |title=Hawaii Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand |first=Bruce |last=Fein |authorlink=Bruce Fein |date=June 6, 2005 |publisher=[[Grassroot Institute of Hawaii]] |location=Honolulu |accessdate=May 7, 2015}}</ref>

In 1993, the US Congress passed a joint [[Apology Resolution]] regarding the overthrow; it was signed by President [[Bill Clinton]]. The resolution apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom and acknowledged that  the United States had annexed Hawaii unlawfully.<ref name = "HDAICS"/>

After [[William McKinley]] won the 1896 U.S. presidential election, advocates pressed to annex Hawaii. The previous president, Grover Cleveland, was a friend of Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani. McKinley was open to persuasion by U.S. expansionists and by annexationists from Hawai{{okina}}i. He met with three annexationists: [[Lorrin A. Thurston]], Francis March Hatch and [[William Ansel Kinney]]. After negotiations in June 1897, Secretary of State [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the Republic of Hawaii.<ref>{{cite web |work=The [[Morgan Report]]  |url= http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=1897_Annexation_Treaty |title= 1897 Hawaii Annexation Treaty |accessdate= August 14, 2010}}</ref> The [[U.S. Senate]] never ratified the treaty.

The Newlands Resolution was passed by the House on June 15, 1898 by 209 votes in favor to 91 against, and by the Senate on July 6, 1898 by a vote of 42 to 21.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1900, Hawaii was granted self-governance and retained [[Iolani Palace|{{okina}}Iolani Palace]] as the territorial capitol building. Despite several attempts to become a state, Hawaii remained a territory for sixty years. Plantation owners and capitalists, who maintained control through financial institutions such as the [[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]], found territorial status convenient because they remained able to import cheap, foreign labor. Such immigration and labor practices were prohibited in many states.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii]] began in 1899 when Puerto Rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes, causing a worldwide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for sugar from Hawaii. Hawaiian [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] owners began to recruit experienced, unemployed laborers in Puerto Rico. Two waves of [[Korean immigration to Hawaii]] occurred in the 20th century. The first wave arrived between 1903 and 1924; the second wave began in 1965 after President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] into law.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

O{{okina}}ahu was the target of a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by [[Imperial Japan]] on December 7, 1941. The attack on Pearl Harbor and other military and naval installations, carried out by [[Warplane|aircraft]] and by [[midget submarine]]s, brought the United States into [[World War II]].

In the 1950s, the power of the plantation owners was broken by the descendants of immigrant laborers, who were born in the incorporated U.S. territory and were U.S. citizens. They voted against the [[Hawaii Republican Party]], strongly supported by plantation owners. The new majority voted for the [[Democratic Party of Hawaii]], which dominated territorial and state politics for more than 40 years. Eager to gain full voting rights, Hawaii's residents actively campaigned for statehood.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} There was concern from both political parties in the U.S. that Hawaii would be a permanent Republican Party stronghold so the admission of Alaska, thought to be a permanent Democratic Party stronghold, was to happen the same year. These predictions turned out to be inaccurate; today, Hawaii votes Democratic predominately, and Alaska votes Republican.<ref>[http://www.gallup.com/poll/188969/red-states-outnumber-blue-first-time-gallup-tracking.aspx Gallup poll]</ref><ref>[ 2016 election result - Politco]</ref><ref>[https://www.boundless.com/political-science/textbooks/boundless-political-science-textbook/interest-groups-7/modern-political-parties-59/red-states-vs-blue-states-337-4262/ Boundless.com - political science - Red States vs. Blue States]</ref><ref>[http://elections.nbcnews.com/ns/politics/2012/all/president/#.VyUpyPkrK00 2012 National Results - NBC news]</ref>

In March 1959, Congress passed the Hawaii Admission Act, which U.S. President [[Dwight D.

The United Nations' [[Special Committee on Decolonization]] later removed Hawaii from [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|its list of self-governing territories]].

Later, state programs promoted Hawaiian culture.{{which|date=March 2015}} The [[1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention|Hawaii State Constitutional Convention of 1978]] created institutions such as the [[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] to promote indigenous language and culture.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Languages===

[[English language|English]] ([[General American]]) and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] are listed as Hawaii's "official languages" in the state's 1978 constitution. Article XV, Section 4 specifies that "Hawaiian shall be required for public acts and transactions only as provided by law". [[Hawaiian Pidgin|Hawai{{okina}}i Creole English]], locally referred to as "Pidgin", is the native language of many native residents and is a second language for many others.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

As of the 2000 Census, 73.44% of Hawaii residents aged five and older exclusively speak English at home.<ref name=mla>{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=15&mode=state_tops |title=Language Map Data Center |publisher=Mla.org |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}</ref> According to the 2008 American Community Survey, 74.6% of Hawaii's residents over the age of five speak only English at home.<ref name="factfinder.census.gov"/> In their homes, 21.0% of state residents speak an additional [[Languages of Asia|Asian language]], 2.6%  speak Spanish, 1.6% speak other [[Indo-European language]]s and 0.2% speak an other language.<ref name="factfinder.census.gov"/>

After English, other languages popularly spoken in the state are [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], Japanese and [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]]. Significant numbers of European immigrants and their descendants also speak their native languages; the most numerous are German, Portuguese, Italian and French.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} 5.37% of residents speak Tagalog—which includes non-native speakers of [[Filipino language]], the national, co-official, Tagalog-based language; 4.96% speak Japanese and 4.05% speak [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]]; 1.2% speak Chinese, 1.68% speak Hawaiian; 1.66% speak Spanish; 1.61% speak [[Korean language|Korean]]; and 1.01% speak [[Samoan language|Samoan]].<ref name=mla/>

Finally, [[Hawai'i Sign Language]] is spoken on the islands, but is dwindling in numbers due to [[American Sign Language]] supplanting HSL through schooling and various other domains.

According to Schütz, the Marquesans colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 CE<ref>{{cite book| last=Schütz| first=Albert J.| title=The Voices of Eden: A History of Hawaiian Language Studies| place=Honolulu| publisher=University of Hawaii Press| year=1994 | isbn=0-8248-1637-4 | pages=334–336; 338 ''20n''}}</ref> and were later followed by waves of seafarers from the [[Society Islands]], [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

These Polynesians remained in the islands; they eventually became the Hawaiian people and [[Hawaiian language#Family and origin|their languages]] evolved into the Hawaiian language.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=35–36}}</ref> Kimura and Wilson say,  "[l]inguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian, with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas, and a secondary link in Tahiti, which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands".<ref>{{Cite book| author1=Kimura, Larry |author2=Pila, Wilson| year=1983 | chapter=Native Hawaiian Culture| title=Native Hawaiian Study Commission Minority Report| pages=173–203 [185] |location=Washington| publisher=[[United States Department of Interior]]}}</ref> Before the arrival of Captain James Cook, the Hawaiian language had no written form. That form was developed mainly by American Protestant |missionaries between 1820 and 1826. They assigned to the Hawaiian phonemes letters from the Latin alphabet.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Interest in Hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century. With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, specially designated immersion schools in which all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian were established. The [[University of Hawaii System|University of Hawaii]] developed a Hawaiian language graduate studies program. Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} A [[sign language]] for the deaf, based on the Hawaiian language, has been in use in the islands since the early 1800s. [[Hawaiʻi Sign Language]] is now nearly extinct.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Hawaiian distinguishes between [[vowel length|long and short vowel sounds]]. In modern practice, vowel length is indicated with a [[macron]] (''[[Hawaiian language#Orthography (writing system)|kahakō]]'').  Hawaiian-language newspapers (''nūpepa'') published from 1834 to 1948 and traditional native speakers of Hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing. The {{okina}}okina and kahakō are intended to help non-native speakers.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  The Hawaiian language uses the [[glottal stop]] (''[[ʻOkina|{{okina}}okina]]'') as a consonant. It is written as a symbol similar to the apostrophe or left-hanging (opening) single quotation mark.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

====Hawaiian Pidgin====
{{Main|Hawaiian Pidgin}}
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Some residents of Hawaii speak [[Hawaiian Pidgin|Hawai{{okina}}i Creole English]] (HCE), endonymically called ''pidgin'' or ''pidgin English''. The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] and Tagalog. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration—mainly from China, Japan, Portugal—especially from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], and Spain—catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as ''pidgin''. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ''ahi''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

HCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words. For example, "aunty" and "uncle" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder. [[Syntax]] and [[grammar]] follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English. For example, instead of "it is hot today, isn't it?", an HCE speaker would say simply "stay hot, eh?"{{efn|English "to be" is often omitted in Pidgin. In contexts where "to be" is used in [[General American]], "to stay" is preferred. "To stay" may have arisen due to an English calque of the Portuguese ''[[:en:wikt:ser#Portuguese|ser]]'', ''[[:en:wikt:estar#Portuguese|estar]]'', or ''[[:en:wikt:ficar#Portuguese|ficar]]''. ''Eh?'' ({{IPA-all|æ̃ː˧˦}}) is a [[tag question]] which may have roots in Japanese, which utilizes ね (ne?) to emphasize a point that may be agreed upon by all parties, or may come from Portuguese [[:en:wikt:né#Portuguese|né?]] (shortened from "[[:en:wikt:não é#Portuguese|não é?]]"), cf. French [[:en:wikt:n'est-ce pas#French|n'est-ce pas ?]]. ''Eh?'' may also have come from English ''yeah''.}} The term ''[[da kine]]'' is used as a [[filler (linguistics)|filler]]; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. During the [[surfing]] boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as ''brah'' and ''da kine'', have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===LGBT===
Hawaii has had a long history of [[queer]] identities. ''Māhū'' people, who often traversed gender as defined by Western standards, were a respected group of pre-colonization people who were widely known in society as healers. Another Hawaiian word, ''aikāne'', referred to same-sex relationships. According to journals written by Captain Cook's crew, it is widely believed that many ''ali{{okina}}i'' engaged in ''aikāne'' relationships. Hawaiian scholar Lilikalā Kame{{okina}}eleihiwa said, "If you didn't sleep with a man, how could you trust him when you went into battle? How would you know if he was going to be the warrior that would protect you at all costs, if he wasn't your lover?"<ref name="mahu">{{cite AV media |people= Xian, Kathryn and Brent Anbe (Directors)|year= 2001|title= ''Ke Kūlana He Māhū'': Remembering a Sense of Place|trans-title= |medium= DVD|url= |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref=}}</ref>

One of the most significant contributors to the high cost of living in Hawaii is the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920]] (also known as the Jones Act), which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports—a practice known as [[cabotage]]. Most U.S. consumer goods are manufactured in East Asia; because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with those goods cannot stop in Honolulu, offload Hawaii-bound goods, load mainland-bound Hawaii-manufactured goods, and continue to West Coast ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to the West Coast, where distributors [[Break bulk cargo|break bulk]] and ship Hawaiian-bound, Asian-manufactured goods back across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.<ref name="Keeping up with the Jones Act">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |title=Keeping up with the Jones Act |date=August 2012 |work=[[Hawaii Business Magazine]] |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083544/http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |archivedate=August 23, 2012 |deadurl=no|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name="U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices">{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-12-12/u-dot-s-dot-law-restricting-foreign-ships-leads-to-higher-gas-prices/ |title=U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices |first=Matthew |last=Philips |date=December 12, 2013 |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |location=New York, NY |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref>

Hawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act. This law makes Hawaii less competitive than West Coast ports as a shopping destination for tourists from countries with much higher taxes like Japan, even though prices for Asian-manufactured goods should be cheaper because Hawaii is much closer than mainland states to Asia.<ref name="Star-Bulletin on Jones Act">{{cite news |url= http://archives.starbulletin.com/97/04/08/business/story3.html |title=U.S.-only shipping rule praised, blasted; Backers and foes of the Jones Act make their case before the Legislature |first=Russ |last=Lynch |newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |date=April 4, 1997 |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |publisher= [[Black Press|Black Press Group Ltd]] |issn=0439-5271|id={{OCLC|9188300|433678262|232117605|2268098}} |accessdate=May 5, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Slom SR11">{{cite web |url= http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2012/bills/SR11_.HTM |title=SR11.DOC |first=Sam |last=Slom |authorlink=Sam Slom |work= Hawaii State Legislature |location=Honolulu, HI, USA |publisher=[[Hawaii State Legislature]] |year=2012 |accessdate=May 5, 2012}} 2012 resolution introduced requesting Congress to exempt Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and Puerto Rico from the Jones Act.</ref>

==Culture==
{{See also|Culture of the Native Hawaiians}}
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}

The aboriginal culture of Hawaii is Polynesian. Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of ''[[luau|lū{{okina}}au]]'' and ''[[hula]]'', are strong enough to affect the wider United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Cuisine===

[[File:Man with a Yoke Carrying Taro by Joseph Strong, oil on canvas board, 1880, Honolulu Museum of Art, accession 12692.1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt = A painting of a man carrying taro by a yoke.|[[Taro]], or in Hawaiian ''kalo'', was one of the primary staples in Ancient Hawaii and remains a central ingredient in Hawaiian gastronomy today.]]

The [[cuisine of Hawaii]] is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and [[Native Hawaiian cuisine]], and [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Polynesian cuisine|Polynesian]] and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] origins. Plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii. ''[[Poi (food)|Poi]]'', a starch made by pounding [[taro]], is one of the traditional foods of the islands. Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous [[plate lunch]], which features two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American [[macaroni salad]] and a variety of toppings including [[hamburger]] patties, a fried egg, and [[gravy]] of a ''[[loco moco]]'', Japanese style ''[[tonkatsu]]'' or the traditional lū{{okina}}au favorites, including ''[[kalua|kālua]]'' pork and ''[[laulau]]''. ''[[Spam musubi]]'' is an example of the fusion of ethnic cuisine that developed on the islands among the mix of immigrant groups and military personnel. In the 1990s, a group of chefs developed [[Hawaii regional cuisine]] as a contemporary fusion cuisine.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Customs and etiquette===
{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Hawaii}}
Some key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert). Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks. Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home. It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the pandango). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as "locals of Hawaii" or "people of Hawaii".

===Hawaiian mythology===
[[File:Ethnologisches Museum Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 009.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone carving of a Hawaiian deity, housed at a German museum.]]
{{Main|Hawaiian mythology}}

Hawaiian mythology comprises the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. It is considered a variant of a more general [[Polynesian mythology]] that developed a unique character for several centuries before about 1800. It is associated with the [[Hawaiian religion]], which was officially suppressed in the 19th century but was kept alive by some practitioners to the modern day.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Prominent figures and terms include [[Aumakua]], the spirit of an ancestor or family god and [[Kāne]], the highest of the four major Hawaiian deities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Polynesian mythology===
{{main|Polynesian mythology}}

[[File:Tahiti-Oro.jpg|thumb|upright|A sacred god figure wrapping for the war god [['Oro]], made of woven dried coconut fibre ([[sennit]]), which would have protected a Polynesian god effigy (''to'o''), made of wood.]]

Polynesian mythology is the [[oral tradition]]s of the people of Polynesia, a grouping of Central and South Pacific Ocean island [[archipelago]]s in the [[Polynesian triangle]] together with the scattered cultures known as the [[Polynesian outliers]]. Polynesians speak languages that descend from a language reconstructed as [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] that was probably spoken in the area around Tonga and Samoa in around 1000 BCE.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Prior to the 15th century, [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian people]] migrated east to the [[Cook Islands]], and from there to other island groups such as Tahiti and the [[Marquesas]]. Their descendants later discovered the islands Tahiti, Rapa Nui and later the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The Polynesian languages are part of the Austronesian language family. Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies. Their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales. The Polynesian cultures each have distinct but related oral traditions; legends or myths are traditionally considered to recount ancient history (the time of "pō") and the adventures of gods ("[[atua]]") and deified ancestors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===List of state parks===
{{main|List of Hawaiian state parks}}

There are [[list of Hawaiian state parks|many Hawaiian state parks]]. 
*The [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] has state parks, recreation areas, and historical parks.
*[[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] has the [[Ahukini State Recreation Pier]], six state parks, and the [[Russian Fort Elizabeth State Historical Park]]. 
*[[Maui]] has two state monuments, several state parks, and the [[Polipoli Spring State Recreation Area]]. [[Moloka‘i]] has the [[Pala'au State Park]]. *[[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]] has several state parks, a number of state recreation areas, and a number of monuments, including the [[Ulu Pō Heiau State Monument]].

===Literature===
{{main|Literature in Hawaii}}

The literature of Hawaii is diverse and includes authors [[Kiana Davenport]], [[Lois-Ann Yamanaka]], and [[Kaui Hart Hemmings]]. Hawaiian magazines include ''[[Hana Hou!]]'', ''[[Hawaii Business Magazine]]'' and ''[[Honolulu (magazine)|Honolulu]]'', among others.

===Music===

The music of Hawaii includes traditional and popular styles, ranging from native Hawaiian folk music to modern [[rock music|rock]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Hawaii's musical contributions to the [[music of the United States]] are out of proportion to the state's small size. Styles like [[slack-key guitar]] are well-known worldwide, while Hawaiian-tinged music is a frequent part of [[Hollywood]] soundtracks. Hawaii also made a major contribution to [[country music]] with the introduction of the [[steel guitar]].<ref name="Unterberger">Unterberger, pp. 465–473</ref>

Traditional Hawaiian folk music is a major part of the state's musical heritage. The Hawaiian people have inhabited the islands for centuries and have retained much of their traditional musical knowledge. Their music is largely religious in nature, and includes chanting and dance music. Hawaiian music has had an enormous impact on the [[Polynesian music|music of other Polynesian islands]]; according to Peter Manuel, the influence of Hawaiian music a "unifying factor in the development of modern Pacific musics".<ref name="Manuel">Manuel, pp. 236–241</ref>

Tourism is an important part of the Hawaiian economy.

The major holidays are the most popular times for outsiders to visit, especially in the winter months. Substantial numbers of Japanese tourists still visit the islands but have now been surpassed by Chinese and Koreans due to the collapse of the value of the Yen and the weak Japanese economy. The average Japanese stays only 5 days while other Asians spend over 9.5 days and spend 25% more.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://files.hawaii.gov/dbedt/visitor/tourism/2015/Oct15.pdf|title = Tourism stats|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Hawaii.gov|first = }}</ref>{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Health==
{{Main|Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act}}
{{As of|2009}}, Hawaii's health care system insures 92% of residents. Under the state's plan, businesses are required to provide insurance to employees who work more than twenty hours per week. Heavy regulation of insurance companies helps reduce the cost to employers. Due in part to heavy emphasis on preventive care, Hawaiians require hospital treatment less frequently than the rest of the United States, while total health care expenses measured as a percentage of state GDP are substantially lower.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Proponents of [[universal health care]] elsewhere in the U.S. sometimes use Hawaii as a model for proposed federal and state health care plans.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Education==

===Public schools===
{{Main|Hawai'i Department of Education}}{{See also|List of elementary schools in Hawaii|List of middle schools in Hawaii|List of high schools in Hawaii}}

Hawaii has the only school system within the U.S. that is unified statewide. Policy decisions are made by the fourteen-member state [[Hawaii Board of Education|Board of Education]], which sets policy and hires the superintendent of schools, who oversees the state [[Hawai'i Department of Education|Department of Education]]. The Department of Education is divided into seven districts; four on O{{okina}}ahu and one for each of the other three counties. The main rationale for centralization is to combat inequalities between highly populated O{{okina}}ahu and the more rural Neighbor Islands, and between lower-income and more affluent areas. In most of the U.S., schools are funded from local property taxes. Educators struggle with children of non-native-English-speaking immigrants, whose cultures are different from those of the mainland, where most course materials and testing standards originate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Public elementary, middle and high school test scores in Hawaii are below national averages on tests mandated under the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. The Hawaii Board of Education requires all eligible students to take these tests and report all student test scores; some other states—Texas and Michigan, for example—do not. This may have unbalanced the results that reported in August 2005 that of 282 schools across the state, 185 failed to reach federal minimum performance standards in mathematics and reading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/education/4870699/detail.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070318182117/http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/education/4870699/detail.html |archivedate=March 18, 2007 |title=Two-Thirds Of Hawaii Schools Do Not Meet Requirements – Education News Story – KITV Honolulu |publisher=Thehawaiichannel.com |date=August 18, 2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref> The [[ACT (examination)|ACT college placement tests]] show that in 2005, seniors scored slightly above the national average (21.9 compared with 20.9),<ref>Honolulu Advertiser, August 17, 2005, p.{{nbsp}}B1</ref> but in the widely accepted [[SAT]] examinations, Hawaii's college-bound seniors tend to score below the national average in all categories except mathematics.

A [[List of Hawaii state highways|system of state highways]] encircles each main island. Only O{{okina}}ahu has federal highways, and is the only area outside the contiguous 48 states to have signed [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]]. Narrow, winding roads and congestion in populated places can slow traffic. Each major island has a public bus system.

[[Honolulu International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA]]:{{nbsp}}HNL), which shares runways with the adjacent [[Hickam Field]] (IATA:{{nbsp}}HIK), is the major commercial aviation hub of Hawaii. The commercial aviation airport offers intercontinental service to North America, Asia, Australia and Oceania. [[Hawaiian Airlines]], [[Mokulele Airlines]] and [[go!

===Rail===
At one time Hawaii had a network of railroads on each of the larger islands that transported farm commodities and passengers. Most were {{RailGauge|3ft}} [[narrow gauge]] systems but there were some {{RailGauge|2ft6in}} gauge on some of the smaller islands. The standard gauge in the U.S. is {{RailGauge|4ft8.5in}}. By far the largest railroad was the [[Oahu Railway and Land Company]] (OR&L) that ran lines from Honolulu across the western and northern part of Oahu.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Railway Album – WW II Photographs Vol 2 |author1=Norton Jr., Victor |author2=Treiber, Gale E. |year=2005 |publisher=Railroad Press |location=Hanover, PA}}</ref>

The OR&L was important for moving troops and goods during World War II. Traffic on this line was busy enough for signals to be used to facilitate movement of trains and to require [[wigwag (railroad)|wigwag]] signals at some railroad crossings for the protection of motorists. The main line was officially abandoned in 1947, although part of it was bought by the U.S. Navy and operated until 1970. {{convert|13|mi|km|spell=In}} of track remain; preservationists occasionally run trains over a portion of this line.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The [[Honolulu High-Capacity Transit Corridor Project]] aims to add elevated passenger rail on Oahu to relieve highway congestion.<ref name="boehonbcn"></ref>

===State government===
The state government of Hawaii is modeled after the federal government with adaptations originating from the kingdom era of Hawaiian history. As codified in the [[Constitution of Hawaii]], there are three [[branches of government]]: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch is led by the [[Governor of Hawaii]], who is assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii]], both of whom are elected on the same ticket. The governor is the only state public official elected statewide; all others are appointed by the governor. The lieutenant governor acts as the [[Secretary of State of Hawaii|Secretary of State]]. The governor and lieutenant governor oversee twenty agencies and departments from offices in the [[Hawaii State Capitol|State Capitol]]. The official residence of the governor is [[Washington Place]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The legislative branch consists of the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Hawaii State Legislature]], which is composed of the 51-member [[Hawaii House of Representatives]] led by the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]], and the 25-member [[Hawaii Senate]] led by the [[President of the Senate]]. The Legislature meets at the State Capitol. The unified judicial branch of Hawaii is the [[Hawaii State Judiciary]]. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]], which uses [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali{{okina}}iōlani Hale]] as its chambers.

===Political subdivisions and local government===
{{see also|List of counties in Hawaii}}
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
The movement of the Hawaiian royal family from Hawai{{okina}}i Island to Maui, and subsequently to O{{okina}}ahu, explains the modern-day distribution of population centers. [[Kamehameha III]] chose the largest city, Honolulu, as his capital because of its natural harbor—the present-day [[Honolulu Harbor]]. Now the state capital, Honolulu is located along the southeast coast of O{{okina}}ahu. The previous capital was [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]], Maui, and before that [[Kailua-Kona]], Hawai{{okina}}i. Some major towns are [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]; [[Kāne'ohe, Hawai'i|Kāne{{okina}}ohe]]; [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Kailua]]; [[Pearl City, Hawaii|Pearl City]]; [[Waipahu, Hawaii|Waipahu]]; [[Kahului, Hawaii|Kahului]]; [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]]. [[Kihei, Hawaii|Kīhei]]; and [[Lihue, Hawaii|Līhu{{okina}}e]].

Hawaii comprises five counties: the [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|City and County of Honolulu]], [[Hawaii County, Hawaii|Hawaii County]], [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], [[Kauai County, Hawaii|Kauai County]], and [[Kalawao County, Hawaii|Kalawao County]].

Hawaii has the fewest local governments among U.S. states.<ref name="USCensus2010">{{cite web | url=http://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2010/compendia/statab/130ed/tables/11s0427.pdf | title=Number of Local Governments by Type | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate=December 4, 2015}}</ref><ref name="USCensus2007">{{cite web | url=http://www2.census.gov/govs/cog/2007/hi.pdf | title=Hawaii  | publisher=U.S. Census Bureau | accessdate=December 4, 2015}}</ref> Unique to this state is the lack of [[Municipal corporation|municipal governments]]. All local governments are generally administered at the [[County (United States)|county]] level. The only incorporated area in the state is [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu County]], a [[consolidated city–county]] that governs the entire island of Oahu. County executives are referred to as mayors; these are the [[Mayor of Hawaii County]], [[Mayor of Honolulu]], [[Mayor of Kauai|Mayor of Kaua{{okina}}i]], and the [[Mayor of Maui]]. The mayors are all elected in [[nonpartisan]] elections.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Kalawao County has no elected government,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/counties.html|title = Hawaii's 4 (or 5) Counties|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}</ref> and as [[#Education|mentioned above]] there are no local [[school district]]s and instead all local public education is administered at the state level by the [[Hawaii Department of Education]].

Hawaii is represented in the [[United States Congress]] by two senators and two [[United States House of Representatives|representatives]]. {{As of|2015}}, all four are Democrats. [[Mark Takai]] represents the [[Hawaii's 1st congressional district|1st congressional district]] in the House, representing southeastern Oahu, including central Honolulu. [[Tulsi Gabbard]] represents the [[Hawaii's 2nd congressional district|2nd congressional district]], representing the rest of the state, which is largely rural and semi-rural.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Brian Schatz]] is the senior United States Senator from Hawaii. He was appointed to the office on December 26, 2012, by Governor [[Neil Abercrombie]], following the death of former senator [[Daniel Inouye]]. The state's junior senator is [[Mazie Hirono]], the former representative from the second congressional district. Hirono is the first female Asian American senator and the first Buddhist senator. Hawaii incurred the biggest [[Seniority in the United States Senate|seniority]] shift between the [[112th United States Congress|112th]] and [[113th United States Congress|113th]] Congresses.

===National politics===
Since gaining statehood and participating in its first election in{{nbsp}}[[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]], Hawaii has supported Democrats in all but two presidential elections; [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]] and{{nbsp}}[[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]], both of which were landslide victories for Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] respectively. In Hawaii's statehood tenure, only Minnesota has supported Republican candidates fewer times in presidential elections.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Hawaii hasn't elected a Republican to represent the state in the U.S. Senate since [[Hiram Fong]] in 1970; since 1977, both of the state's U.S. Senators have been Democrats.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kaste|first=Martin|url=http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/09/13/161096416/can-a-republican-win-a-senate-seat-in-blue-hawaii|title=Can A Republican Win A Senate Seat In Blue Hawaii?|publisher=''[[NPR]]''|date=September 13, 2012|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13805-2004Aug18.html|title=Hiram Fong Dies; One of First Hawaiian Senators|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|date=August 19, 2004|accessdate=May 17, 2015}}</ref>

In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], [[John Kerry]] won the state's four electoral votes by a margin of nine percentage points with 54% of the vote. Every county supported the Democratic candidate. In 1964, [[favorite son]] candidate senator [[Hiram Fong]] of Hawaii sought the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nomination, while [[Patsy Mink]] ran in the Oregon primary in 1972.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Honolulu-born [[Barack Obama]], then serving as [[United States Senator]] from [[Illinois]], was elected the [[List of United States Presidents|44th]] President of the United States on [[United States presidential election, 2008|November 4, 2008]] and was re-elected for a second term on [[United States Presidential Election, 2012|November 6, 2012]]. Obama had won the Hawaii Democratic caucus on February 19, 2008, with 76% of the vote. He was the third Hawaii-born candidate to seek the nomination of a major party and the first presidential nominee from Hawaii.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rudin |first=Ken |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/politicaljunkie/2009/12/todays_junkie_segment_on_totn_5.html |title=NPR's ''Political Junkie'' |publisher=Npr.org |date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=96126355 |title=Asian Writer Ponders First Asian President Too |publisher=Npr.org |date=October 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref>

==Legal status of Hawaii==
{{main|Legal status of Hawaii}}

While Hawaii is internationally recognized as a state of the United States of America while also being broadly accepted as such in mainstream understanding, the international legality of this status has been raised before the U.N. and other international forums,<ref name=UN-forum/> and in daily dialogue in Hawaii. Domestically, the debate is a topic covered in the Hawaii school curriculum,<ref name=curriculum/> and has been the subject of cases brought before the U.S. Supreme Court,<ref name=supreme/> and U.S. District Court.<ref name=district/>

On September 29, 2015 the [[Department of the Interior]] announced a procedure to recognize a Native Hawaiian government.<ref name=Lauer>{{cite news|last1=Lauer|first1=Nancy Cook|title=Interior Department announces procedure for Native Hawaiian recognition|url=http://westhawaiitoday.com/news/local-news/interior-department-announces-procedure-native-hawaiian-recognition|accessdate=October 7, 2015|agency=West Hawaii Today|publisher=Oahu Publications|date=September 30, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Interior Proposes Path for Re-Establishing Government-to-Government Relationship with Native Hawaiian Community|url=https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-proposes-pathway-re-establishing-government-government|website=Department of the Interior|publisher=Office of the Secretary of the Department of the interior|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref> (for further information, see [[US federal recognition of Native Hawaiians]]).

===Hawaiian sovereignty movement===
{{main|List of Hawaiian sovereignty movement groups|l1=Hawaiian sovereignty movement}}

[[Political]] organizations seeking some form of sovereignty for Hawaii have been active since the 1880s. Generally, their focus is on [[self-determination]] and [[self-governance]], either for Hawaii as an independent nation (in many proposals, for "Hawaiian nationals" descended from subjects of the Hawaiian Kingdom or declaring themselves as such by choice), or for people of whole or part [[native Hawaiian]] ancestry in an indigenous "''nation to nation''" relationship akin to [[tribal sovereignty]] with [[US federal recognition of Native Hawaiians]].

Some groups also advocate some form of redress from the [[United States]] for the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|1893 overthrow]] of [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], and for what is described as a prolonged [[military occupation]] beginning with the 1898 annexation. The movement generally views both the overthrow and annexation as illegal, with the [[Apology Resolution]] passed by US Congress in 1993 cited as a major impetus by the movement for Hawaiian sovereignty.<ref>[http://hawaii-nation.org/rape.html "The Rape of Paradise: The Second Century Hawai'ians Grope Toward Sovereignty As The U.S. President Apologizes"], Perceptions Magazine, March/April 1996, p. 18-25</ref> The sovereignty movement considers Hawaii to be an illegally occupied nation.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grass|first1=Michael|title=As Feds Hold Hearings, Native Hawaiians Press Sovereignty Claims|url=http://www.govexec.com/state-local/2014/08/hawaii-sovereignty-department-interior-hearings/91247/|accessdate=October 29, 2015|agency=Government Executive|publisher=Government Executive|date=August 12, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=United States Social Forum.
