'''Aachen''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʔaːxn̩|-|De-Aachen-2.ogg}}), also known as ''Bad Aachen'', is a [[spa town|spa]] and [[border town]]<ref name=young>{{harvnb|Young|Stetler|1987|p=272}}</ref> in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]]. Aachen was a residence of [[Charlemagne]], and later the coronation place for [[List of German monarchs|German kings]].<ref name=munro/>

Aachen is the westernmost city of Germany, on its borders with Belgium and the Netherlands, {{convert|61|km|abbr=on}} west-southwest of [[Cologne]]<ref name=CVDE>{{harvnb|Bridgwater|Aldrich|1968|p=11}}</ref><ref name=EA>{{harvnb|Bayer|2000|p=1}}</ref> in a former coal-mining area.<ref name=EA/> [[RWTH Aachen University]] is in the city.<ref group = nb>"RWTH" is the abbreviation of "Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule", which translates into "Rhine-Westphalian Technical University". The institution is commonly referred to as "RWTH Aachen" or simply "RWTH", with the abbreviation remaining untranslated in other languages to avoid the use of the "Hochschule" term, which is sometimes mistakenly translated as [[Highschool#United States|highschool]]. Sometimes, RWTH Aachen is also referred to as "TH Aachen" or "Aachen University".<br/>''Note:'' The term "FH Aachen" does not refer to the RWTH but to the [[Fachhochschule Aachen]], a [[Fachhochschule|university of applied sciences]], which is also in Aachen.</ref><ref name="rwth-aachen.de">{{harvnb|RWTH Aachen University|2013}}</ref> Aachen's industries include science, engineering and information technology.

== Name ==
[[File:Aachen Neues Kurhaus.jpg|thumb|Aachen's Neues Kurhaus]]
The name "Aachen" is a modern descendant, like southern [[German language|German]] "''Ach(e)''", "''Aach''", meaning "river" or "stream", of [[Old High German]] "''ahha''", meaning "water" or "stream", which directly translates (and etymologically corresponds to) [[Latin]] ''Aquae'', referring to the springs. The location has been inhabited by humans since the [[Neolithic]] era, about 5,000 years ago, attracted to its warm [[mineral spring]]s. Latin ''Aquae'' figures in Aachen's [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] name ''Aquae granni'', which meant '[[Grannus]]' waters', referring to the [[Celts|Celtic]] god of healing who was worshiped at the springs.<ref name=munro/><ref name="tourism">{{harvnb|Mielke|2013}}</ref> This word became ''Åxhe'' in [[Walloon language|Walloon]] and ''Aix'' in French, and subsequently ''Aix-la-Chapelle'' after [[Charlemagne]] had a cathedral built there in the late eighth century and then made the city his empire's capital.

Aachen's name in French and the [[loan translation]] in German evolved in parallel. The city is known by a variety of different names in other languages:

=== Aachen dialect ===
Aachen is at the western end of the [[Benrath line]] that divides [[High German languages|High German]] to the south from the rest of the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] speech area to the north.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2013}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=February 2014}} Aachen's local dialect is called [[Aachen dialect|Öcher Platt]] and belongs to the [[Ripuarian language]].

[[File:Construction d Aix-la-Chapelle.jpg|thumb|right|Construction of Aix-la-Chapelle, by [[Jean Fouquet]]]]
[[File:Aachen1566.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval architecture in Aachen]]

=== Early history ===
Flint quarries on the [[Lousberg]], Schneeberg, and Königshügel, first used during [[Neolithic]] times (3,000–2,500 {{smallcaps|b}}.{{smallcaps|c}}.), attest to the long occupation of the site of Aachen, as do recent finds under the modern city's ''Elisengarten'' pointing to a former settlement from the same period. [[Bronze Age]] (''ca''. 1600 {{smallcaps|b}}.{{smallcaps|c}}.) settlement is evidenced by the remains of barrows (burial mounds) found, for example, on the Klausberg. During the [[Iron Age]], the area was settled by Celtic peoples<ref>{{harvnb|Schumacher|2009}}</ref> who were perhaps drawn by the marshy Aachen basin's [[hot spring|hot sulphur springs]] where they worshiped [[Grannus]], god of light and healing.

Later, the 25-hectare Roman spa resort town of ''Aquae Granni'' was, according to legend, founded by Grenus, under [[Hadrian]], in ''ca''. {{smallcaps|a}}.{{smallcaps|d}}. 124. Instead, the fictitious founder refers to the Celtic god, and it seems it was the Roman 6th Legion at the start of the 1st century that first channelled the hot springs into a spa at Büchel,{{refn| group = nb |This audio file is Andreas Schaub explaining the archaeological record in court in ''Archäologie am Hof''.<ref name=CVDE/><ref>{{harvnb|Schaub|2013}}</ref>}} adding at the end of the same century the ''Münstertherme'' spa,<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}</ref> two water pipelines, and a likely sanctuary dedicated to Grannus. A kind of forum, surrounded by colonnades, connected the two spa complexes. There was also an extensive residential area, part of it inhabited by a flourishing Jewish community.<ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com">{{harvnb|Freimann|1906|p=301}}</ref> The Romans built bathhouses near [[Burtscheid]]. A temple precinct called ''Vernenum'' was built near the modern [[Kornelimünster/Walheim]]. Today, remains have been found of three bathhouses,<ref name=DofA>{{harvnb|McClendon|1996|p=1}}</ref> including two fountains in the ''Elisenbrunnen'' and the Burtscheid bathhouse.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Roman civil administration fell apart in Aachen between the end of the 4th and beginning of the 5th centuries. Rome withdrew its troops from the area but the town remained populated. By 470, the town came to be ruled by the [[Ripuarian Franks]]<ref name=Coll>{{harvnb|Held|1997|p=2}}</ref> and subordinated to their capital, [[Cologne]].

=== Middle Ages ===
After Roman times, [[Pepin the Short]] had a castle residence built in the town, due to the proximity of the hot springs and also for strategic reasons as it is located between the [[Rhineland]] and northern France.<ref name=DofA2>{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=1}}</ref> [[Einhard]] mentions that in 765–6 Pepin spent both Christmas and Easter at ''Aquis villa'' ("{{lang|la|Et celebravit natalem Domini in Aquis villa et pascha similiter.}}"),<ref>{{harvnb|Eginhard|2012|p=10}}</ref> which must have been sufficiently equipped to support the royal household for several months. In the year of his coronation as King of the [[Kingdom of the Franks|Franks]], 768, [[Charlemagne]] came to spend Christmas at Aachen for the first time.{{refn|group=nb|This is in dispute, as some history books state that Charlemagne was in fact born in Aachen in 742.<ref name=WB/>}} He went on to remain there in a [[Palace of Aachen|mansion]] which he may have extended, although there is no source attesting to any significant building activity at Aachen in his time, apart from the building of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] (since 1929, cathedral) and the palatial presentation halls. Charlemagne spent most winters in Aachen between 792 and his death in 814. Aachen became the focus of his court and the political centre of his empire. After his death, the king was buried in the church which he had built;<ref name=DofA5>{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=4}}</ref> his original tomb has been lost, while his alleged remains are preserved in the shrine where he was reburied after being declared a saint; his saintliness, however, was never very widely acknowledged outside.
In 936, [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto I]] was crowned king of [[Kingdom of East Francia|East Francia]] in the collegiate church built by Charlemagne. While [[Otto II]] ruled, the nobles revolted and the [[West Francia|West Frank]]s, under [[Lothair of France|Lothair]],<ref name=dupuy>{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=258}}</ref> raided Aachen in the ensuing confusion.<ref>{{harvnb|Kitchen|1996|p=35}}</ref>{{refn|group=nb|This was during the period of 970 to 980.<ref name=dupuy/>}} Aachen was attacked again, this time by [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Odo of Champagne]] who attacked the imperial palace while [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad]] was absent. Odo relinquished it quickly and was killed soon thereafter.<ref>{{harvnb|Kitchen|1996|p=40}}</ref> The palace and town of Aachen received fortifying walls by order of [[Emperor Frederick Barbarossa]] between 1172 and 1176.<ref name=DofA/> Over the next 500 years, most kings of [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] destined to reign over the [[Holy Roman Empire]] were crowned in Aachen. The original audience hall built by Charlemagne was torn down and replaced by the current [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]] in 1330.{{refn|group=nb|Sources differ on the age of the [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]], as the dates used for the construction were 1334 through 1349.<ref name=DofA/>}}<ref name=DofA/> The last king to be crowned here was [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] in 1531.<ref name=CVDE/><ref name=AAE/> During the [[Middle Ages]], Aachen remained a city of regional importance, due to its proximity to [[Flanders]], achieving a modest position in the trade in [[wool]]len cloths, favoured by imperial privilege. The city remained a [[free imperial city]], subject to the emperor only, but was politically far too weak to influence the policies of any of its neighbours. The only dominion it had was over [[Burtscheid]], a neighbouring territory ruled by a [[Benedictine]] [[abbess]]. It was forced to accept that all of its traffic must pass through the "Aachener Reich". Even in the late 18th century the Abbess of Burtscheid was prevented from building a road linking her territory to the neighbouring estates of the [[Duchy of Jülich|duke of Jülich]]; the city of Aachen even deployed its handful of soldiers to chase away the road-diggers.

As an imperial city, Aachen held certain political advantages that allowed it to remain independent of the troubles of Europe for many years. It remained a direct vassal of the Holy Roman Empire throughout most of the Middle Ages. It also was the site of many important church councils. These included the [[Council of 837]],<ref>{{harvnb|De Jong|1996|p=279}}</ref> and the [[Council of 1166]], a council convened by the [[antipope]] [[Paschal III]].<ref name=EA/>

=== Manuscript production ===
Aachen has proven an important site for the production of historical manuscripts. Under Charlemagne's purview, both the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Ada Gospels]] and the [[Coronation Gospel]]s may have been produced in Aachen.<ref name=DofA1>{{harvnb|McKitterick|1996|p=1}}</ref> In addition, quantities of the other texts in the court library were also produced locally. During the reign of [[Louis the Pious]] (814–840), substantial quantities of ancient texts were produced at Aachen, including legal manuscripts such as the ([[leges scriptorium group]]), [[patristic]] texts including the five manuscripts of the [[Bamberg Pliny Group]].<ref name=DofA1/> Finally, under [[Lothair I]] (840–855), texts of outstanding quality were still being produced. This however marked the end of the period of manuscript production at Aachen.<ref name=DofA1/>

=== 16th through 18th centuries ===
In 1598, following the invasion of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] troops from the [[Netherlands]], [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf]] deposed all Protestant office holders in Aachen and even went as far as expelling them from the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Holborn|1982|p=295}}</ref> From the early 16th century, Aachen started losing its power and influence. It started with the crowning of emperors occurring not in Aachen but in [[Frankfurt]], followed by the religious wars, and the great fire of 1656.<ref name="eb">{{harvnb|Encyclopædia Britannica Online|2006}}</ref> After the destruction of most of the city in 1656, the majority of the rebuilding utilised the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style.<ref name=DofA/> It then culminated in 1794, when the French, led by General [[Charles Dumouriez]],<ref name=Coll/> occupied Aachen.<ref name=AAE/>

Aachen became attractive as a spa by the middle of the 17th century, not so much because of the effects of the hot springs on the health of its visitors but because Aachen was then – and remained well into the 19th century – a place of high-level prostitution in Europe. Traces of this hidden agenda of the city's history is found in the 18th-century guidebooks to Aachen as well as to the other spas; the main indication for visiting patients, ironically, was [[syphilis]]; only by the end of the 19th century had rheumatism become the most important object of cures at Aachen and Burtscheid. Aachen was chosen as the site of several important congresses and peace treaties: the [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|first congress of Aachen]] (often referred to as the ''Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle'' in English) on 2 May 1668,<ref name=dupuy1>{{harvnb|Dupuy|Dupuy|1986|p=563}}</ref> leading to the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|First Treaty of Aachen]] in the same year which ended the [[War of Devolution]].<ref>{{harvnb|Holborn|1982a|p=70}}</ref> The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second congress]] ended with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|second treaty]] in 1748, ending the [[War of the Austrian Succession]].<ref name=CVDE/><ref>{{harvnb|Holborn|1982a|p=217}}</ref> In 1789, there was a constitutional crisis within the Aachen government,<ref>{{harvnb|Wilson|2004|p=301}}</ref> and in 1794 Aachen lost its status as a [[free imperial city]].<ref name=DofA/>

=== 19th century ===
On 9 February 1801, the [[Peace of Lunéville]] removed the ownership of Aachen and the entire "left bank" of the Rhine from Germany and granted it to France.<ref name=Coll/> In 1815, control of the town was passed to [[Prussia]], by an act that was passed by the [[Congress of Vienna]].<ref name=DofA/><ref name=AAE/> The [[Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818)|third congress]] took place in 1818 to decide the fate of occupied [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]ic France.

By the middle of the 19th century, industrialisation swept away most of the city's medieval rules of production and commerce, although the entirely corrupt remains of the city's medieval constitution were kept in place (compare the famous remarks of Georg Forster in his ''Ansichten vom Niederrhein'') until 1801, when Aachen became the "[[Prefectures in France|chef-lieu]] du [[Roer (department)|département de la Roer]]" in Napoleon's [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] took over and the city became one of its most socially and politically backward centres until the end of the 19th century.<ref name=CVDE/> Administered within the [[Rhine Province]], by 1880 the population was 80,000. Starting in 1838, the railway from [[Cologne]] to [[Belgium]] passed through Aachen.<ref>{{harvnb|Holborn|1982b|p=11}}</ref> The city suffered extreme overcrowding and deplorable sanitary conditions up to 1875 when the medieval fortifications were finally abandoned as a limit to building operations and new, less miserable quarters were built in the eastern part of the city, where drainage of waste liquids was easiest. In December 1880, the [[Trams in Aachen|Aachen tramway network]] was opened, and in 1895 it was electrified.<ref>{{harvnb|Van der Gragt|1968|p=137}}</ref> In the 19th century and up to the 1930s, the city was important for the production of railway locomotives and carriages, iron, [[pin]]s, [[sewing needle|needles]], [[button]]s, tobacco, woollen goods, and silk goods.

=== 20th century ===
After [[World War I]], Aachen was occupied by the Allies until 1930.<ref name=AAE/> Aachen was one of the locations involved in the ill-fated [[Rhenish Republic]]. On 21 October 1923 an armed band took over city hall. Similar actions took place in [[Mönchengladbach|Mönchen-Gladbach]], [[Duisburg]], and [[Krefeld]]. This republic lasted only about a year.<ref>{{harvnb|Holborn|1982b|p=614}}</ref> Aachen was heavily damaged during [[World War II]]. The city and its fortified surroundings were laid siege to from 12 September–21 October 1944 by the US 1st Infantry Division<ref name=1d>{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=76}}</ref> with the 3rd Armored Division assisting from the south.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=51}}</ref> Around 13 October the US 2nd Armored Division played their part, coming from the north and getting as close as [[Würselen]],<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=50}}</ref> while the 30th Infantry Division played a crucial role in completing the encirclement of Aachen on 16 October 1944.<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=109}}</ref> With reinforcements from the US 28th Infantry Division<ref>{{harvnb|Stanton|2006|p=105}}</ref> the [[Battle of Aachen]] then continued involving direct assaults through the heavily defended city, which finally forced the German garrison to surrender on 21 October 1944.<ref name=1d/> Aachen was the first German city to be captured by the Allies, and its residents welcomed the soldiers as liberators.<ref name="baker2004">{{harvnb|Baker|2004|p=37}}</ref> The city was destroyed partially – and in some parts completely – during the fighting,<ref name=CVDE/> mostly by [[United States Army|American]] [[artillery]] fire and demolitions carried out by the [[Waffen-SS]] defenders. Damaged buildings included the medieval churches of [[Foillan|St. Foillan]], [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]] and [[Saint Nicholas|St. Nicholas]], and the [[Aachen Rathaus|Rathaus]] (city hall), although [[Aachen Cathedral]] was largely unscathed. Only 4,000 inhabitants remained in the city; the rest had followed evacuation orders. Its first Allied-appointed mayor, [[Franz Oppenhoff]], was assassinated by an SS commando unit.

==== History of Aachen Jews ====
During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period, Aachen was the site of a flourishing [[Jewish]] community. Later, during the [[Carolingian]] empire, a Jewish community was found near the royal palace.<ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/> In 802, a Jew named Isaac accompanied the ambassador of [[Charlemagne]] to [[Harun al-Rashid]]. During the 13th century, many Jews converted to Christianity, as shown in the records of the Church of St. Mary. In 1486, the Jews of Aachen offered gifts to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] during his coronation ceremony. In 1629, the Aachen Jewish community was expelled from the city. In 1667, six Jews were allowed to return. Most of the Aachen Jews settled in the nearby town of [[Burtscheid]]. On 16 May 1815, the Jewish community of the city offered an homage in its synagogue to the Prussian king, [[Friedrich Wilhelm III]]. A Jewish cemetery was acquired in 1851. 1,345 Jews lived in the city in 1933. The synagogue was destroyed during [[Kristallnacht]] in 1938. In 1939, after emigration and arrests, 782 Jews remained in the city. After [[World War II]], only 62 Jews lived there. In 2003, 1,434 Jews were living in Aachen. In Jewish texts, the city of Aachen was called Aish, or Ash (אש).

=== 21st century ===
The city of Aachen has developed into a technology hub as a by-product of hosting one of the leading [[Institute of Technology|universities of technology]] in Germany with the [[RWTH Aachen]] (Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule), known especially for mechanical engineering, automotive and manufacturing technology as well as for its research and academic hospital [[Klinikum Aachen]], one of the largest medical facilities in Europe.

== Geography ==
[[File:Drilandenpunt.jpg|thumb|upright|The three-country point: where the borders of Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands meet]]
Aachen is located in the middle of the [[Meuse–Rhine Euroregion]], close to the border [[tripoint]] of Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. It lies near the head of the open valley of the [[Wurm|River Wurm]] (which today flows through the city in canalised form), part of the larger basin of the [[Meuse|River Meuse]], and about {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} north of the [[High Fens]], which form the northern edge of the [[Eifel]] uplands of the [[Rhenish Massif]].

The maximum dimensions of the city's territory are {{convert|21.6|km|1|abbr=on}} from north to south, and {{convert|17.2|km|1|abbr=on}} from east to west. The city limits are {{convert|87.7|km|1|abbr=on}} long, of which {{convert|23.8|km|1|abbr=on}} border Belgium and {{convert|21.8|km|1|abbr=on}} the Netherlands. The highest point in Aachen, located in the far southeast of the city, lies at an elevation of 410&nbsp;m above sea level. The lowest point, in the north, and on the border with the Netherlands, is at 125&nbsp;m.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== Climate ===
As the westernmost city in Germany<ref name=munro>{{harvnb|Munro|1995|p=1}}</ref> (and close to the Low Countries), Aachen and the surrounding area belongs to a [[Temperate climate|temperate climate zone]], with humid weather, mild winters, and warm summers. Because of its location north of the [[Eifel]] and the [[High Fens]] and its subsequent prevailing westerly weather patterns, rainfall in Aachen (on average 805&nbsp;mm/year) is comparatively higher than, for example, [[Bonn]] (with 669&nbsp;mm/year). Another factor in the local weather forces of Aachen is the occurrence of [[Foehn winds]] on the southerly air currents, which results from the city's geographic location on the northern edge of the Eifel.<ref name=climate>{{harvnb|Anon|2013b}}</ref>

Because the city is surrounded by hills, it suffers from [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion-related]] smog. Some areas of the city have become [[urban heat island]]s as a result of poor heat exchange, both because of the area's natural geography, as well as from human activity. The city's numerous cold air corridors, which are slated to remain as free as possible from new construction, therefore play an important role in the urban climate of Aachen.<ref>{{harvnb|Aachen Department of Environmental|2013}}</ref>

The January average is
{{convert|3.0|°C|0|abbr=on}}, while the July average is {{convert|18.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Precipitation is almost evenly spread throughout the year.

== Geology ==
[[File:Aachen Felsen St.Adalbert.JPG|thumb|Layered [[sandstone]] and [[claystone]] [[formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] from the [[Devonian]] period below St. Adalbert Church in Aachen]]

The geology of Aachen is very structurally heterogeneous. The oldest occurring rocks in the area surrounding the city originate from the [[Devonian]] period and include [[carboniferous]] [[sandstone]], [[Graywacke]], [[claystone]] and [[limestone]]. These formations are part of the [[Rhenish Massif]], north of the High Fens. In the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] subperiod of the [[Carboniferous]] geological period, these rock layers were narrowed and folded as a result of the [[Variscan orogeny]]. After this event, and over the course of the following 200 million years, this area has been continuously flattened.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Ernest Masson|editor1-last= Healy|editor1-first=David|year= 2012|title=Faulting, Fracturing and Igneous Intrusion in the Earth's Crust|issue=367|volume=367|publisher=Geological Society of London|isbn=1-86239-347-8|issn=0305-8719}}</ref>

During the [[Cretaceous]] period, the ocean penetrated the continent from the direction of the [[North Sea]] up to the mountainous area near Aachen, bringing with it clay, sand, and chalk deposits. While the clay (which was the basis for a major [[pottery]] industry in nearby [[Raeren]]) is mostly found in the lower areas of Aachen, the hills of the [[Aachen Forest]] and the [[Lousberg]] were formed from upper Cretaceous sand and chalk deposits. More recent sedimentation is mainly located in the north and east of Aachen and was formed through [[tertiary]] and [[quaternary]] river and wind activities.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Along the major [[thrust fault]] of the [[Variscan orogeny]], there are over 30 [[thermal spring]]s in Aachen and [[Burtscheid]]. Additionally, the subsurface of Aachen is traversed by numerous active faults that belong to the Rurgraben fault system, which has, in the past, been responsible for numerous earthquakes, including the 1756 [[Düren]] Earthquake<ref name="duerenEQ">{{harvnb|University of Cologne, Seismological Station Bensberg|2013}}</ref> and the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]],<ref name="Roermond">{{harvnb|Geological Survey of North Rhine-Westphalia|2013}}</ref> which was the strongest earthquake ever recorded in the [[Netherlands]].

== Main sights ==
[[File:Aachen Theatre.jpg|thumb|Theater Aachen]]

=== Aachen Cathedral ===
[[Aachen Cathedral]] was erected on the orders of [[Charlemagne]] in AD 796<ref name=EA/> and was, on completion, in 798,<ref name=DofA3>{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=2}}</ref> the largest cathedral north of the [[Alps]]. It was modelled after the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], in [[Ravenna]], Italy,<ref name=AAE/> and was built by [[Odo of Metz]].<ref name=EA/> Charlemagne also desired for the chapel to compete with the [[Lateran Palace]], both in quality and authority.<ref name=DofA6/> It was originally built in the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] style, including marble covered walls, and mosaic inlay on the dome.<ref name=DofA4>{{harvnb|McClendon|1996a|p=3}}</ref> On his death, Charlemagne's remains were interred in the cathedral and can be seen there to this day. The cathedral was extended several times in later ages, turning it into a curious and unique mixture of building styles. The throne and gallery portion date from the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]], with portions of the original [[opus sectile]] floor still visible.<ref name=DofA4/> The 13th century saw gables being added to the roof, and after the fire of 1656, the dome was rebuilt. Finally, a [[Choir (architecture)|choir]] was added around the start of the 15th century<ref name=DofA5/> After, [[Frederick Barbarossa]] [[Canonization|canonised]] Charlemagne, in 1165, the chapel became a destination for pilgrims.<ref name=DofA5/> For 600 years, from 936 to 1531, Aachen Cathedral was the church of coronation for 30 German kings and 12 queens. The church built by Charlemagne is still the main attraction of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|City of Aachen|2013}}</ref> In addition to holding the remains of its founder, it became the burial place of his successor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. In the upper chamber of the gallery, Charlemagne's marble throne is housed.<ref name=young2>{{harvnb|Young|Stetler|1987|p=273}}</ref> Aachen Cathedral has been designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

Most of the marble and columns used in the construction of the cathedral were brought from [[Rome]] and [[Ravenna]], including the [[sarcophagus]] that Charlemagne was eventually laid to rest in.<ref name=DofA6>{{harvnb|Gaehde|1996|p=4}}</ref> A bronze bear from [[Gaul]] was placed inside, along with an equestrian statue from Ravenna, believed to be [[Theodric]]. These were in contrast to a wolf and a statue of [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the [[Capitoline]].<ref name=DofA6/> Bronze pieces such as the doors and railings were cast in a local foundry, some of which have survived to the present. Finally, there is uncertainty surrounding the bronze pine cone in the chapel, and where it was created. Wherever it was made, it was also a parallel to a piece in Rome, this in [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]].<ref name=DofA6/>

==== Treasury ====
Aachen has housed, throughout its history, a collection of liturgical objects. The origination of this [[Aachen Cathedral Treasury|treasury]] is in dispute as some say Charlemagne himself endowed his chapel with the original collection, while the rest were collected over time. Others say all of the objects were collected over time, from such places as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Constantinople]].<ref name=DofA6/> The location of this treasury of objects has moved over time, The location was unknown until the 15th century when it was located in St. Matthew's Chapel until 1873, when it was moved to Charles Chapel. From there it was moved, in 1881, to the Hungarian Chapel, and in 1931 to its present location next to the Poor Souls' Chapel.<ref name=DofA6/> Of the original [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] objects, only six remain, and of those, only three are left in Aachen: the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]], a [[diptych]] of [[Christ]], and an early [[Byzantine silk]]. The [[Coronation Gospels]] and a [[St. Stephen's Purse|reliquary burse]] of [[St. Stephen]] were moved to [[Vienna]], in 1798, and the [[Talisman of Charlemagne]] was given as a gift in 1804 to [[Josephine Bonaparte]] and subsequently to [[Reims Cathedral]].<ref name=DofA6/> 210 documented pieces have been added to the treasury since its inception, typically to receive in return legitimisation of linkage to the heritage of Charlemagne. The [[Lothar Cross]], the [[Gospels of Otto III]] and multiple additional Byzantine silks were donated by [[Otto III]]. the [[Pala d'Oro]] and a covering for the [[Aachen Gospels (Ada School)|Aachen Gospels]] made of gold donated by [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]].<ref name=DofA6/> [[Frederick Barbarossa]] donated the candelabrum that adorns the dome and the shrine that Charlemagne was placed in 1215. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] donated a pair of reliquaries. [[Louis XI]] gave, in 1475, the crown of [[Margaret of York]], and, in 1481, another arm reliquary of Charlemagne. [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] both gave numerous works of art by [[Hans von Reutlingen]].<ref name=DofA6/> Continuing the tradition, objects continued to be donated until the present, each indicative of the period of its gifting, with the last documented gift being a chalice from 1960 made by [[Ewald Mataré]].<ref name=DofA6/>

=== Other sights ===
The [[Aachen Rathaus|city hall]], dated from 1330,<ref name=WB>{{harvnb|Merkl|2007|p=2}}</ref> lies between two central places, the ''Markt'' (market place) and the ''Katschhof'' (between city hall and cathedral). The coronation hall is on the first floor of the building. Inside you can find five frescoes by the Aachen artist Alfred Rethel which show legendary scenes from the life of Charlemagne, as well as Charlemagne's signature. It also contains the hall of the emperors,<ref name=EB>{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|pp=1–2}}</ref> along with replicas of the imperial crown jewels.<ref name=young2/>

The ''Grashaus'', a late medieval house at the Fisch Markt, is one of the oldest non-religious buildings in downtown Aachen. It hosted the city archive. The Grashaus was the former city hall before the present building took over this function.

The ''Elisenbrunnen'' is one of the most famous sights of Aachen. It is a neo-classical hall covering one of the city's famous fountains. It is just a minute away from the cathedral. Just a few steps in south-eastern direction lies the 19th-century [[Theater Aachen|theatre]].

Also of note are two remaining city gates, the ''[[Ponttor]]'' (Pont gate), one half-mile northwest of the cathedral, and the ''Marschiertor'' (marching gate), close to the central railway station. There are also a few parts of both medieval city walls left, most of them integrated into more recent buildings, but some others still visible. There are even five towers left, some of which are used for housing.

[[St. Michael's Church, Aachen]] was built as a church of the Aachen Jesuit Collegium in 1628. It is attributed to the Rhine mannerism and a sample of a local Renaissance-architecture. The rich façade remained unfinished until 1891 when the historistic architect Peter Friedrich Peters added to it. The church is a Greek Orthodox church today, but the building is used also for concerts because of its good acoustics.

The Jewish synagogue in Aachen which was destroyed at the [[Night of Broken Glass]] ([[Kristallnacht]]) on 9 November 1938, was reinaugurated on 18 May 1995.<ref>{{harvnb|American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise|2013}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Knufinke|2013}}</ref> One of the contributors for the reconstructions of the synagogue was [[Jürgen Linden]], the Lord Mayor of Aachen from 1989 to 2009.

There are numerous other notable churches and [[monastery|monasteries]], a few remarkable 17th- and 18th-century buildings in the particular [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style typical of the region, a Jewish synagogue, a collection of statues and monuments, park areas, cemeteries, among others. Among the museums in the town are the [[Suermondt-Ludwig Museum]], which has a fine sculpture collection and the [[Aachen Museum of the International Press]], which is dedicated to newspapers from the 16th century to the present.<ref name=EB/> The area's industrial history is reflected in dozens of 19th- and early 20th-century manufacturing sites in the city.

=== Rail ===
Aachen's railway station, the [[Aachen Central Station|Hauptbahnhof]] (Central Station), was constructed in 1841 at the [[Cologne-Aachen high-speed railway|Cologne-Aachen railway line]] and replaced in 1905, moving it significantly closer to the city centre. It serves main lines to Cologne, [[Aachen–Mönchengladbach railway|Mönchengladbach]] and [[HSL 3|Liège]] as well as branch lines to [[Heerlen]], [[Alsdorf]], [[Stolberg (Rhineland)|Stolberg]] and [[Eschweiler]]. [[Intercity-Express|ICE high speed trains]] from [[Brussels]] via [[Cologne]] to [[Frankfurt am Main]] and [[Thalys]] trains from Paris to Cologne also stop at Aachen Central Station. Four [[Regional-Express|RE]] lines and two [[Regionalbahn|RB]] lines connect Aachen with the [[Ruhr]]gebiet, Mönchengladbach, Spa (Belgium), [[Düsseldorf]] and the [[Siegerland]]. The ''[[Euregiobahn]]'', a regional railway system, reaches several minor cities in the Aachen region.

There are four smaller stations in Aachen: ''[[Aachen West station|Aachen West]]'', ''[[Aachen Schanz station|Aachen Schanz]]'', ''[[Aachen-Rothe Erde station|Aachen-Rothe Erde]]'' and ''[[Eilendorf station|Eilendorf]]''.
