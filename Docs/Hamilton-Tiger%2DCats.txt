The '''Hamilton Tiger-Cats''' are a professional [[Canadian football]] team based in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], [[Canada]], founded in 1950 with the merger of the [[Hamilton Tigers (football)|Hamilton Tigers]] and the [[Hamilton Wildcats (Canadian football)|Hamilton Wildcats]].<ref name="merger">{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_timeline_1860 |title=History &#124; CFL.ca &#124; Official Site of the Canadian Football League |publisher=CFL.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> They are currently members of the [[CFL East Division|East Division]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). The Tiger-Cats play their home games at [[Tim Hortons Field]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/news-story/3889891-goodbye-ivor-wynne-hello-tim-hortons-field/|title=Goodbye Ivor Wynne, hello Tim Hortons Field|publisher=TheSpec.com|date=July 12, 2013|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto2015.org/lang/en/gallery/news/construction-of-hamilton-pan-am-soccer-stadium-for-toronto-2015-games-already-10-complete.html|title=Construction of Hamilton Pan Am Soccer Stadium for TORONTO 2015 Games Already 10% Complete|publisher=Toronto 2015 Pan American/Parapan American Games|date= May 24, 2013|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref>

Since the 1950 merger, the team has won the [[Grey Cup]] championship eight times, most recently in [[1999 Grey Cup|1999]]. The Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club also recognizes all Grey Cups won by Hamilton-based teams as part of their history, which would bring their win total to 15 (the Hamilton Tigers with five, Hamilton Flying Wildcats with one and [[Hamilton Alerts]] also with one).<ref name="cupswon">{{cite web|url=http://www.ticats.ca/page/history_greycup |title=HISTORY - Grey Cup &#124; Hamilton Tiger-Cats |publisher=Ticats.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> However, the CFL does not recognize these wins under one franchise, rather as the individual franchises that won them.<ref name="GC Records">{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/2011/Grey_Cup_Record_Book_2011.pdf |title=Grey Cup Record Book 2011|publisher=Cfl.ca|accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> If one includes their historical lineage, Hamilton football clubs won league championships in every decade of the 20th century, a feat matched by only one other North American franchise in professional sports, the Triple-A [[Rochester Red Wings]] of the [[International League]].  Neither of these teams won a championship in the first decade of the 21st century.

In their first forty years of existence, the Tiger-Cats were a model franchise, qualifying for the playoffs in all but three of those years and winning seven Grey Cup championships. They are one of only six teams in the modern era to win the [[60th Grey Cup|Grey Cup at home]] and were the first to accomplish this when they did it in [[1972 Hamilton Tiger-Cats season|1972]]. However, since 1990, they have missed the playoffs on eleven occasions and have won just one [[87th Grey Cup|Grey Cup]] in [[1999 Hamilton Tiger-Cats season|1999]]. Their lowest moment came when they lost a [[List of Canadian Football League records (team)|Canadian Football League record]] 17 games in one season with just one win during their [[2003 Hamilton Tiger-Cats season|2003 season]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfl.ca/uploads/assets/CFL/PDF_Docs/Records_2011_Regular_and_Playoffs.pdf |title=CFL Regular Season Team Records|publisher=Cfl.ca|accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> The franchise has started to return to prominence after qualifying for the post-season in four of the past five seasons, including a loss in the [[101st Grey Cup]] and again in the [[102nd Grey Cup]].

== Franchise history ==
[[Image:The Tigers of Hamilton football team.jpg|thumb|right|The "Tigers" of [[Hamilton, Ontario]] circa 1906.]]
Although the current Hamilton Tiger-Cats were only founded in 1950, football in Hamilton goes back much further than that.<ref name="cflapedia.com">{{cite web|url=http://cflapedia.com/teams/hamilton.htm |title=Hamilton Tiger-Cats |publisher=Cflapedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> The history of Hamilton Tiger-Cats Football Club can be traced back to November 3, 1869 in a room above George Lee’s Fruit Store, when the Hamilton Football Club was formed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tiger-Cats History|url=http://www.ticats.ca/page/history_history|accessdate=2008-09-14}}</ref> The Hamilton football club played their first game on December 18, 1869 against the 13th Battalion (now [[Royal Hamilton Light Infantry]]). In 1872, the Hamilton Football club began play at the [[Hamilton Amateur Athletic Association Grounds|Hamilton AAA Grounds]] and they became known as the Tigers in 1873.<ref name="web.archive.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/cflhistory/Teams/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027031556/http://www.geocities.com/cflhistory/Teams/Hamilton_Tiger-Cats.htm |archivedate=2009-10-27 |title=Soudog's CFL History Fan Site: Hamilton Tiger-Cats |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref>

The Hamilton Tigers began play in the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]] (ORFU) in 1883 and won their first [[Canadian Dominion Football Championship]] in [[1906 in Canadian football|1906]] when the Tigers beat [[McGill University]] 29–3. The Tigers continued in the ORFU until 1907, when the [[Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] (IRFU) was formed. The IRFU later became known as the Big Four and eventually, the IRFU became the East division of the modern CFL in the 1950s. The Tigers faced stiff local competition with the ORFU's [[Hamilton Alerts]] who, in [[4th Grey Cup|1912]], won the City of Hamilton its first [[Grey Cup]], the trophy that was now awarded to the Canadian Dominion Football Champions, by beating the [[Toronto Argonauts]] 11–4.

[[Image:Ottawa and Hamilton Tigers football game 5.jpg|thumb|left|The Hamilton Tigers playing an unknown Ottawa team in 1910.]]
In the following season (1913), the Tigers won their first of five Grey Cups when they beat the [[Toronto Parkdale Canoe Club]] by the lopsided margin of 44–2. The Alerts were refused entry into the ORFU in 1913 with many of its players opting to join the Tigers, while the Alerts gradually faded from existence.<ref name="Facts, Figures & Records"/> The Alerts gave way to a team under the name Hamilton Rowing Club from 1913–1915, who also played in the ORFU. 1914 saw the complete amalgamation of the Hamilton Alerts and the Hamilton Tigers and the football club continued playing under the name "Tigers".<ref name="web.archive.org"/> In 1915, in the final pre-war season, the Hamilton Tigers won their second Grey Cup.

After over a decade-long drought, the Hamilton Tigers won the Grey Cup championship game in 1928, 1929 and 1932. The 1941 season saw the Tigers suspend play for the remainder of World War II. The Hamilton Tigers folded, largely because a number of players had gone into the armed services. It is believed by some that the failure of the Tigers is what caused the IRFU to be dissolved, and the Eastern Rugby Football Union (ERFU) to be formed.<ref name="cflapedia.com"/> Because of the absence of the Tigers, a new club called the Hamilton Wildcats were formed to play in the ORFU in 1941. The Wildcats were given permission to use players from the Hamilton Tigers, but not the traditional black and yellow colors of the Tigers. In 1943, the Hamilton Flying Wildcats, stocked with [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] personnel, won the [[31st Grey Cup]].

Things returned to normal in 1945 when the IRFU and the Hamilton Tigers resumed play while the Wildcats (no longer known as the Flying Wildcats) continued on in the ORFU. In 1948 the [[Hamilton Wildcats]] joined the [[IRFU]] to replace the Tigers who joined the [[Ontario Rugby Football Union]]. The Tigers and Wildcats switch of unions only lasted two years (1948–49) as both clubs struggled. At this time, the Tigers and Wildcats competed for fans, talent and bragging rights so vehemently that neither team could operate on a sound financial level.<ref name="cflapedia.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticats.ca/page/history_history |title=TIGER-CATS HISTORY &#124; Hamilton Tiger-Cats |publisher=Ticats.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> Consequently, The Tigers and Wildcats amalgamated in 1950 to form the '''Hamilton Tiger-Cats''' that would compete in the IRFU.<ref name="web.archive.org"/> Under the guidance of prominent and distinguished local leaders such as Ralph "Super-Duper" Cooper and F.M. Gibson, it was decided that the two teams should merge as one that would represent Hamilton. Cooper was named team president and [[Carl Voyles]] served as head coach and general manager. A contest was held among the fans to determine the colors for the newly formed football club; the result was a combination of the two clubs' colors: yellow, black, red, white and blue. Over the years, the colors have evolved to gold, black and white and remain to this day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Derek Drager |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0003554 |title=Hamilton Tiger-Cats |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> In 1950, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats began playing in [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]], until 2012 after which it was demolished and replaced with a new stadium on the same site, [[Tim Hortons Field]], in 2014.

=== A Steel Town dynasty (1950–1972) ===

[[Image:IvorWynneStadium Hamilton.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ivor Wynne Stadium]], former home of the Tiger-Cats.]]
The Ti-Cats had great success throughout the 1950s and 1960s, in the 1950s and 1960s the club appeared in ten Grey Cups. They finished first in the East thirteen times from 1950 to 1972. During that same time span, they appeared in eleven [[Grey Cup]] finals winning the championship six times. Players, such as [[Angelo Mosca]], [[Bernie Faloney]], [[Joe Zuger]] and [[Garney Henley]] became football icons in the Steel City. Beginning in 1957 under coach [[Jim Trimble]] (who left the team after the 1962 season), the Tiger-Cats played in every national final through 1967, except for those of 1960 and 1966, winning 4 Cups (1957, 1963, 1965 and 1967).

The Cats 1972 Grey Cup win, 13–10 over the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]], was led by two sensational rookies, [[Chuck Ealey]] who had an outstanding college career at the [[University of Toledo]] and [[Ian Sunter]], an 18-year-old kicker who booted the deciding field goal that gave Hamilton the cup.

During this era, the Tiger-Cats also became (and remain to this day) the only Canadian team to have ever defeated a current [[National Football League]] team; on August 8, 1961, they defeated the [[Buffalo Bills]] by a score of 38–21 (at the time, Buffalo was still a part of the [[American Football League]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/international/story/6699961 |title=NFL International historical results |accessdate=2008-01-05 |date=2002-05-08 |publisher=National Football League |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207165524/http://www.nfl.com/international/story/6699961 |archivedate=2005-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmbolding.com/BSR/CFL-NFL_Hamilton_Tiger-Cats_vs_Buffalo_Bills_1961.htm |title=Hamilton Tiger-Cats vs. Buffalo Bills, August 8, 1961, |accessdate=2008-01-05 |publisher=Mark Bolding}}</ref>

=== Later years ===

In 1978, [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] owner, [[Harold Ballard]] assumed ownership of the Tiger Cats. Ballard claimed to be losing a million dollars a year.<ref name=p124>All Work and All Play: A Life in the Outrageous Sport, p.124, John Wiley and Sons Canada Ltd., Mississauga, ON, 2005, ISBN 0-470-83552-4</ref> The Tiger-Cats contended on and off during the rest of the 1970s and 1980s, reaching the Grey Cup final in 1980 and winning the East Division by a mile in [[1981 CFL season|1981]] with an 11–4–1 record under head coach [[Frank Kush]], but were stunned by the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]], who finished a distant second at 5–11, in the East final. The Tabbies' defense was very stout, talented and hungry that decade, led by standouts [[Grover Covington]], [[Ben Zambiasi]], [[Howard Fields]] and [[Mitchell Price]]. They were complemented very well on offense with quarterbacks [[Tom Clements]] and [[Mike Kerrigan]] throwing to [[Rocky DiPietro]] and [[Tony Champion]] leading to three straight trips to the Grey Cup in 1984, 1985 and 1986, the latter resulting in winning the title over the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] by a score of 39–15. In 1986, Ballard publicly called the Tiger-Cats a bunch of overpaid losers.<ref name=p124/> After the Tiger-Cats beat the Toronto Argonauts in the 1986 Eastern Final, Ballard said “You guys may still be overpaid, but after today, no one can call you losers.”<ref name=p124/> A few days later, the Tiger-Cats won the 1986 Grey Cup by beating the Edmonton Eskimos 39–15; Ballard said it was worth every penny.

Hamilton businessman [[David Braley]] bought the team in 1989, and he would eventually sell the team to a community-based group in 1992 due to continued poor attendance. Hamilton returned to the Grey Cup in [[1989 CFL season|1989]], but were on the losing end of a 43–40 thriller to [[Saskatchewan Roughriders|Saskatchewan]].

The 1990s were marked by financial instability, and constant struggles on the field. Quarterback was a weak spot for the Ti-Cats, as the first half of the decade had names like [[Don McPherson]], [[Damon Allen]], [[Timm Rosenbach]], [[Matt Dunigan]], [[Lee Saltz]] and [[Todd Dillon]] taking their turns at the pivot. Despite the excellent play of Eastern All-Star [[Earl Winfield]] rewriting the team's record books for pass catching, Hamilton struggled to attract crowds to [[Ivor Wynne Stadium]]. It was not until [[1998 CFL season|1998]] with the arrival of head coach [[Ron Lancaster]] and the pitch-and-catch duo of [[Danny McManus]] and [[Darren Flutie]] plus the pass rush abilities of [[Joe Montford]] that led Hamilton back to the CFL's elite, reaching the Grey Cup finals in 1998 and winning the cup the following [[1999 CFL season|year]]. However, the Ti-Cats would then suffer a slow decline. In 2000, Hamilton finished 9-9, losing 4 of their last 5 games, as well as the East semifinal 24-22 to Winnipeg. In 2001, Hamilton finished 11-7, and lost to Winnipeg in the playoffs for a second straight season, 28-13. In 2002, Hamilton finished 7-11 and missed the playoffs. The team would reach their lowest ebb in 2003, having a not only franchise-worst season, but the worst record in CFL history, finishing 1-17, with only a 27-24 overtime victory in week 14 keeping the declawed Tiger-Cats from having an imperfect season.

[[Image:Toronto Argonauts vs. Hamilton Tiger-Cats at Rogers Centre, October 27 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Tiger-Cats vs. [[Toronto Argonauts|Argonauts]], October 27, 2005, at [[Rogers Centre]]]]
Native Hamiltonian [[Bob Young (businessman)|Bob Young]] has owned the Tiger-Cats since 2004, and although the team had a resurgence in home attendance, corporate sponsorship plus a brand new "Tiger Vision" scoreboard at Ivor Wynne stadium, it struggled with its on-field performance. Last place finishes both in 2005 (5–13) and 2006 (4–14), resulted in an overhaul of the coaching staff for 2007. The moves still did not immediately help, as the team continued to lag in last place in 2007 and 2008 despite numerous apparent upgrades. In 2009, their fortunes turned around when they finished in second place in the East, qualifying for the playoffs for the first time in several years. However, they failed to win the Grey Cup, marking the 2000s as the first decade since the 1890s that Hamilton failed to win a national championship.

On August 31, 2011, the Tiger-Cats announced plans to close Ivor Wynne Stadium at the end of the 2012 season and begin play in the long planned [[Tim Hortons Field|Pan American Stadium]] in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticats.ca/article/new-stadium-announcement-caretaker-s-commitment|title=New Stadium Announcement: Caretaker’s Commitment|publisher=}}</ref> Throughout the 2013 season, they played their home games at Guelph University's stadium because the new stadium was still under construction.  On November 24, 2013, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats lost to the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] 45-23 in the [[101st Grey Cup]] at [[Mosaic Stadium at Taylor Field]]. The game had star appeal as actor [[Tom Hanks]] attended with comedian [[Martin Short]], a Hamilton native.  Early in the third quarter, Hanks was shown replacing a Ti-cats toque with a Riders hat, drawing a loud roar from the crowd.  In the last three seasons, the Grey Cup host city has won the championship game ([[BC Lions]], [[Toronto Argonauts]], and Saskatchewan Roughriders).  After construction of the new stadium fell behind schedule in 2014, the team moved the first few games of its 2014 season to [[Ron Joyce Stadium]].

Tim Hortons Field opened in time for the 2014 Labour Day Classic, which coincided with the Tiger-Cats going on a long run that propelled the team from 1—6 prior to that game to 9—9 (in a year when the East was particularly weak, this was enough to win the division) and two further playoff wins, propelling the team to its second straight Grey Cup appearance, which would also be its second straight Grey Cup loss as the [[Calgary Stampeders]] held off a late comeback effort from the Tiger-Cats to win 20–16.  The team went undefeated at Tim Hortons Field in its inaugural season at the stadium.

== Logo ==
The Tiger-Cats logo for many decades was an exact reverse of the Princeton University Tigers athletic logo. The artwork for the original "leaping tiger" is claimed by Hamilton. Both logos have since been revised or replaced. The colours of the logo are black, yellow, and white.

== Rivals ==
Since 1873, the [[List of sports rivalries|arch-rivals]] of the Tiger-Cats have been the [[Toronto Argonauts]]. The first meeting between the two teams took place on October 18, 1873 at the [[University of Toronto]] where the Argonauts defeated the Hamilton Football Club by a Goal and a Try to Nil.<ref name="Facts, Figures & Records">2009 Canadian Football League Facts, Figures & Records, Canadian Football League Properties/Publications, Toronto, Ontario, ISBN 978-0-9739425-4-5, p.293</ref> Hamilton and Toronto are merely 51&nbsp;km apart along the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]] (QEW) highway and, for relatively brief periods of time, were the only [[Canadian Football League|CFL]] teams in Ontario as a result of the demise of the [[Ottawa Rough Riders]] in 1996 and the demise of the [[Ottawa Renegades]] in 2006, although Ottawa fielded a new team called the Ottawa RedBlacks in 2014. In the [[Labour Day Classic]] match-ups since 1948, Hamilton has been victorious 31 times to Toronto's 15.  Since [[1996 Hamilton Tiger-Cats season|1996]], the two teams have played the [[Labour Day Classic]] each year at Hamilton's Ivor Wynne Stadium, with the [[2011 Hamilton Tiger-Cats season|2011 season]] and the [[2013 Hamilton Tiger-Cats season|2013 season]] being recent exceptions.  In 2014 and 2015, the [[Labour Day Classic]] continued the tradition, with the game being held at Hamilton's new stadium, Tim Hortons Field.  As has been the case for several years, the two teams then have a [[rematch]] the following week at Toronto's stadium, currently the [[Rogers Centre]], but that will change next year (2016) when the Argonauts move to a different facility.  There have been 17 playoff match-ups between the two teams, with Toronto being victorious 10 times to Hamilton's 7.  On November 17, 2013, the Tiger-Cats defeated the Argonauts 36-24 in the East Division Final game, which gave Hamilton a Grey Cup berth.  On November 15, 2015, the Tiger-Cats defeated the Argonauts 25-22, to advance to the East Division Final against the Ottawa RedBlacks.

== Broadcasters ==
Corus Radio Hamilton was the official radio broadcast rights holder for the Tiger-Cats and had been the official voice for CFL football in the Greater Hamilton Area for over 40 years. AM900 [[CHML]], together with brother station Y108, offered coverage of all Tiger-Cats games, including pre-season games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.900chml.com/ |title=(CHML AM) AM 900 |publisher=900chml.com |date=2013-09-18 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticats.ca/article/corus-radio-hamilton-is-the-2009-home-to-the-hamilton-tiger-cats |title=Corus Radio Hamilton Is The 2009 Home To The Hamilton Tiger-Cats &#124; Hamilton Tiger-Cats |publisher=Ticats.ca |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2013-10-24}}</ref> Hamilton Tiger-Cats games broadcast on [[CHML]] were anchored by the  announcers team of Rick Zamperin, [[John Salavantis]], and Matt Holmes. Zamperin, CHML's sports director, became the play-by-play announcer in 2007 after six seasons as sideline reporter. Color commentator [[John Salavantis]] was a former football coach with the Tiger-Cats, Ottawa Rough Riders, [[Montreal Machine]], and the [[Ottawa University Braves]]. CHML's Matt Holmes was the pre-game show host and sideline reporter. The post-game show, "The Fifth Quarter", was hosted by Ted Michaels.

In May 2015, the Tiger-Cats announced that, beginning this season, they would be leaving CHML for [[CKOC]], where the team will operate a joint venture with [[TSN Radio]]. No announcing staff has yet been announced for the Tiger-Cats broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ticats.ca/tiger-cats-bell-media-announce-new-partnership-with-launch-of-tsn-radio-1150-hamilton|title=Tiger-Cats Bell Media Announce New Partnership with Launch of TSN Radio 1150 Hamilton|publisher=}}</ref> Through the 2015 season, former McMaster Marauders quarterback [[Marshall Ferguson]] offered sideline analysis of all Tiger-Cats games, along with a post-game show on TSN 1050. Ferguson was promoted to lead play-by-play announcer in 2016.
