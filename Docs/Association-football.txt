The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.

The [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and only in their [[penalty area]]. Outfield players mostly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use their head or torso to do so instead. The team that scores the most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or the game goes into [[extra time]] or a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] depending on the format of the competition. The [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] were originally codified in England by [[The Football Association]] in 1863. Association football is governed internationally by the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football]] (FIFA; {{lang-fr|Fédération Internationale de Football Association}}), which organises World Cups for both [[FIFA World Cup|men]] and [[FIFA Women's World Cup|women]] every four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314003412/http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html |archivedate=14 March 2005 |title=2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage |publisher=FIFA |date=5 December 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=unfit }}</ref>

The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name ''association football'' was coined to distinguish the game from the [[Football|other forms of football]] played at the time, specifically [[rugby football]]. The term ''soccer'' originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an [[Oxford "-er"]] abbreviation of the word "association".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usembassy.org.uk/rss/transcripts/worldcup2006a.html |title=The Yanks are Coming: A U.S. World Cup Preview |accessdate=6 June 2009 |last=Mazumdar |first=Partha |date=5 June 2006 |publisher=Embassy of the United States in London}}</ref>

Within the [[English-speaking world]], association football is now usually called ''football'' in the United Kingdom and mainly ''soccer'' in Canada and the United States. People in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand use either or both terms, although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use "football" for the formal name.<ref>[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Soccer/Soccer-to-become-football-in-Australia/2004/12/16/1102787198357.html?from=moreStories Soccer to become football in Australia - Soccer - www.smh.com.au]</ref>

According to [[FIFA]], the Chinese competitive game ''[[cuju]]'' (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball")<!--transliterated as Tsu' Chu in ref--> is the earliest form of football for which there is scientific evidence.<ref name=fifa-or>{{cite web | title = History of Football | publisher=FIFA| url = http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/origins.html | accessdate =29 April 2013}}</ref> ''Cuju'' players could use any of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net.

The [[Cambridge Rules]], first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], at a meeting attended by representatives from [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]] schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], formed by former public school pupils in 1857,<ref>{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |title=Football, the first hundred years |publisher=Routledge |page=126 |year=2005 |location=London |isbn=0-415-35018-2}}</ref> which led to formation of a [[Sheffield & Hallamshire Football Association|Sheffield FA]] in 1867. In 1862, [[J. C. Thring|John Charles Thring]] of [[Uppingham School]] also devised an influential set of rules.<ref>{{cite news |first=David |last=Winner |date=28 March 2005 | title = The hands-off approach to a man's game |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-1544006,00.html |accessdate=7 October 2007 | location=London}}</ref>

These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of [[The Football Association]] (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the [[Freemasons' Tavern]] in [[Great Queen Street]], London.<ref name="FAhistory">{{cite web |title=History of the FA |publisher=Football Association (FA) |url=http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/history |accessdate=9 October 2007}}</ref> The only school to be represented on this occasion was [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]], withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other [[History of rugby union|English rugby clubs followed this lead]] and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the [[Rugby Football Union]]. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.<ref name="FAhistory"/> These rules included handling of the ball by "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to [[Australian rules football|Victorian rules football]] being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.<ref name="Merger">{{cite book|author=Young, Percy M.|year=1964|title=Football in Sheffield|pages=28–29|publisher=S.

The world's oldest football competition is the [[FA Cup]], which was founded by [[C. W. Alcock]] and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The [[Scotland v England (1872)|first official international football match]] also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in [[Glasgow]], again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first [[The Football League|football league]], which was founded in [[Birmingham]] in 1888 by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of the Football League |publisher=Football League |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0,,10794~1357277,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501121005/http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0,,10794~1357277,00.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref> The original format contained 12 clubs from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Northern England]].

===Women's association football===

[[File:Mia1997.JPG|thumb|A women's international match between the United States and Germany]]

==== Early women's football ====

Women may have been playing "football" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game ([[Tsu Chu]]) was played by women during the [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 CE).  Two female figures are depicted in [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu.<ref name="globalgame">{{cite web|title=Genesis of the Global Game | work=The Global Game | url=http://www.theglobalgame.com/aboutus.html | accessdate=22 May 2006 }}</ref> There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE.<ref name="footballnetwork">{{cite web|title=The Chinese and Tsu Chu | work=The Football Network | url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history1.asp | accessdate=1 May 2006 }}</ref> Reports of an annual match being played in Scotland are reported as early as the 1790s.<ref name="SFA">{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Women's Football|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=409|publisher=Scottish Football Association|accessdate=18 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308172042/http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=409|archivedate=8 March 2005}}</ref><ref name="emagazine.credit-suisse.com">[http://emagazine.credit-suisse.com/article/index2.cfm?fuseaction=OpenArticlePrint&aoid=37289&lang=en "Football history: Winning ways of wedded women"]</ref> The first match recorded by the [[Scottish Football Association]] took place in 1892 in [[Glasgow]].

Association football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women.  In Europe, it is possible that 12th-century French women played football as part of that era's folk games. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too.<ref name="SFA"/><ref name="emagazine.credit-suisse.com"/> In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardized rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.<ref name="FA"/>

The most well-documented early European team was founded by activist [[Nettie Honeyball]] in England in 1894. It was named the [[British Ladies' Football Club]]. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, "I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the ‘ornamental and useless’ creatures men have pictured.

Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the [[World War I|First World War]], when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was [[Dick, Kerr's Ladies]] of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston, England]]. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from [[Paris]], [[France]], in April, and also made up most of the England team against a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0.<ref name="SFA"/>

==Gameplay==
[[File:U20-WorldCup2007-Okotie-Onka edit2.jpg|thumb|A goalkeeper saving a close-range shot from inside the penalty area]]

Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. The game is played using a spherical ball of {{convert|68.5|–|69.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} circumference,<ref>[http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Become-a-licensee/Tests/Circumference/ Circumference - FIFA Quality Programme<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> known as the ''[[Ball (association football)|football]]'' (or ''soccer ball''). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a [[Captain (association football)|captain]] who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or [[penalty kick]]s.<ref name="laws51-52"/>

The primary law is that players other than [[Goalkeeper (football)|goalkeepers]] may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they do use their hands during a [[throw-in]] restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around, they may use any part of their body (notably, "heading" with the forehead)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://expertfootball.com/wp/heading/ |title=How to head a football |accessdate=3 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101215132821/http://expertfootball.com/training/heading.php| archivedate= 15 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> other than their hands or arms.<ref name="fouls">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 12) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011115718/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}</ref> Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though the ball cannot be received in an [[Offside (football)|offside]] position.<ref name="offsidelaw">{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 11&nbsp;– Offside |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |author=IFAB |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=31}}</ref>

[[File:20121209 PSG-Juvisy - Kenza Dali 04.jpg|thumb|A player executing a slide [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]] to dispossess an opponent]]
In game play, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by [[dribbling]], passing the ball to a team-mate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through [[Tackle (football move)#Association football|tackling]] the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.<ref name="restart">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 8) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142456/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref>

At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005–06 season]] of the English [[Premier League]] produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.<ref>{{cite news |title=England Premiership (2005/2006) |work=Sportpress.com |url=http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023234/http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |accessdate=5 June 2007}}</ref> The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,<ref name=LAW301>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3–Number of Players) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142527/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref> but a number of [[association football positions|specialised roles]] have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: [[Striker (association football)|striker]]s, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; [[Defender (football)|defenders]], who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and [[midfielder]]s, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm |title=Positions guide, Who is in a team? |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=24 September 2007 | date=1 September 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071021101352/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm| archivedate= 21 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The layout of a team's players is known as a ''[[Formation (association football)|formation]]''.

==Laws==
{{redirects here|Rules of football|the rules of other football games|Football}}
{{main|Laws of the Game (association football)}}
There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html| title=Laws of the Game |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=2 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070901044035/http://fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html| archivedate= 1 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.

===Players, equipment, and officials===
{{See also|Association football positions|Formation (association football)|Kit (association football)}}
[[File:Howard Webb3.jpg|thumb|The [[referee (association football)|referee]] officiates in a football match]]
Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding [[substitute (association football)|substitute]]s), one of whom must be the [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]]. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the [[penalty area]] in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of [[association football positions|positions]] in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.<ref name=LAW301/>

The basic equipment or ''[[Kit (association football)|kit]]'' players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate [[shin guard]]s. An [[jockstrap|athletic supporter]] and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strikingeagles.tripod.com/health_advice_for_boys.htm |title=Health Advice for Boys |publisher=Strikingeagles.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.leagueathletics.com/Images/Club/6097/The%20Prevention%20of%20injuries.pdf |title=Soccer Position Paper |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> [[Association football headgear|Headgear]] is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury. Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws4_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 4–Players' Equipment) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141601/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws4_01.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref>

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in [[exhibition game|friendly matches]]. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or [[timewasting]] at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3–Substitution procedure) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144947/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_02.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}</ref> IFAB recommends "that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team."

{{anchor|Match officials}}
A game is officiated by a [[referee (association football)|referee]], who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two [[assistant referee]]s. In many high-level games there is also a [[fourth official]] who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 5–The referee) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141909/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref>

===Ball===
{{main|Ball (association football)}}

The ball is spherical with a circumference of between {{convert|68|and|70|cm|in}}, a weight in the range of {{convert|410|to|450|g|oz}}, and a pressure of between {{convert|8.5|and|15.6|psi|bar|1|order=flip}} <!-- rounding and flipped to get the values to equal FIFA's --> at sea level.  In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation, but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.<ref>{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2013/2014|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/81/42/36/log2013en%5fneutral.pdf|website=www.fifa.com|publisher=FIFA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Football-facts/Football-manufacturing/|title=Football manufacturing|work=FIFA quality program|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>

===Pitch===
{{Main|Football pitch}}
[[File:Football pitch metric.svg|thumb|Standard pitch measurements ([[:File:Football pitch imperial.svg|See Imperial version]])]]
As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within [[IFAB]], the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in [[imperial units]]. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate [[SI|metric]] equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of [[metrication]] (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.<ref>{{cite news |title=Will we ever go completely metric? |work=BBC news |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3934353.stm |date=2 September 2004 |last=Summers |first=Chris |accessdate=7 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071010064850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3934353.stm| archivedate= 10 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

The length of the pitch for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110&nbsp;m (110–120&nbsp;yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75&nbsp;m (70–80&nbsp;yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120&nbsp;m (100–130&nbsp;yd) length and 45–90&nbsp;m (50–100&nbsp;yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105&nbsp;m (344&nbsp;ft) long and 68&nbsp;m (223&nbsp;ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/media/news/newsid=707751/|title=Goal-line technology put on ice |publisher=FIFA |date=8 March 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}</ref><!-- ref for last sentence only --> however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/77/82/55/circularno.1145-amendmentstothelawsofthegame-2008.pdf |title=FIFA Amendments to the Laws of the Game, 2008 |publisher=FIFA |format=PDF |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref>

The longer boundary lines are ''touchlines'', while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are ''goal lines''. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.1–The field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142202/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_01.htm| archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref> The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be 7.32&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;yd) apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be 2.44&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft) above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.4–The Field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144942/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}</ref>

In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5&nbsp;m (18&nbsp;yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-off]]s, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.3–The field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011084145/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}</ref>

===Duration and tie-breaking methods===
A standard adult football match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each, known as halves. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.<ref name="rule7.2"/> The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called ''additional time'' in FIFA documents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721055324/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archivedate=2012-07-21|title=Interpretation of the Laws of the Game&nbsp;– Law 07|publisher=FIFA.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/refereeing/law_7_the_duration_of_the_match_en_47401.pdf|title=Law 7 - The Duration of the Match|publisher=FIFA.com}}</ref> but is most commonly referred to as ''stoppage time'' or ''injury time'', while ''loss time'' can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, toward the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.<ref name="rule7.2">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 7.2–The duration of the match) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144952/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 11 October 2007}}</ref> Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock, some competitions may invoke [[Replay (sports)|replays]].<ref>For example in the [[FA Cup]] prior to the semi-finals.</ref> A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] (known officially in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count toward the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).<ref name="laws51-52">{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Procedures to determine the winner of a match or home-and-away |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |author=IFAB |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |pages=51–52}}</ref>

In competitions using [[two-legged match]]es, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the [[away goals rule]] may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.<ref name="laws51-52"/>

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the [[IFAB]] experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (''[[golden goal]]''), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (''[[silver goal]]''). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was [[France national football team|France]]'s victory over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in 1998. [[Germany national football team|Germany]] was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in the final of [[Euro 1996]]. Silver goal was used in [[Euro 2004]]. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.<ref>{{cite news | title = Time running out for silver goal |publisher=Rediff.com |agency=Reuters | url = http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm | last=Collett |first=Mike | date = 2 July 2004 | accessdate =7 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071102232630/http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm| archivedate= 2 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Ball in and out of play===
{{Main|Ball in and out of play}}

Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ''ball in play'' and ''ball out of play''. From the beginning of each playing period with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:
[[File:Shunsuke1 20080622.jpg|thumb|right|A player takes a free kick, while the opposition form a "wall" to try to block the ball]]
* [[Kick-off (association football)|Kick-off]]: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.<ref name="restart"/>
* [[Throw-in]]: when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws15_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 15–The Throw-in) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142556/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws15_01.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref>
* [[Goal kick]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws16_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 16–The Goal Kick) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141725/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws16_01.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref>
* [[Corner kick]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the defending team; awarded to attacking team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws17_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 17–The Corner Kick) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142324/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws17_01.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref>
* [[Indirect free kick]]: awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick.<ref name="freekick">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws13_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 13–Free Kicks) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142645/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws13_01.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref>
* [[Direct free kick]]: awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls.<ref name="freekick"/> A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick.
* [[Penalty kick]]: awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws14_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 14–The Penalty Kick) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142717/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws14_01.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 13 September 2007}}</ref>
* [[Dropped-ball]]: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.<ref name="restart"/>

===Misconduct===
{{main|Foul (association football)}}

====On-field====
{{double image|right|Yellow card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Players are cautioned with a yellow card, and dismissed from the game with a red card. These colours were first introduced at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] and used consistently since.}}
A [[foul (football)|foul]] occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an [[indirect free kick]].<ref name="fouls"/>

The referee may punish a player's or substitute's [[misconduct (football)|misconduct]] by a caution ([[Penalty card|yellow card]]) or dismissal ([[Penalty card|red card]]). A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card, and therefore to a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been "booked", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.<ref name="fouls"/>

Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4188646.stm |title=Referee's signals: advantage |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 March 2011 |date=14 September 2005}}</ref> The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within "a few seconds". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.<ref>{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 5: The Referee: Advantage |url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |author=IFAB |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=66}}</ref>

The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Laws of the Game |chapter=Law 5: The Referee|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12_en.pdf |format=PDF |author=IFAB |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=5 May 2012 |page=24}}</ref> The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.

====Off-field====
{{see also|Foul (association football)#Post-match}}
[[File:Women's football final at 2007 Pan Ams.jpg|thumb|right|Women's football final at 2007 Pan Am games.]]
Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, [[Doping in sport|doping]], [[Age fraud in association football|age fraud]] and [[match fixing]]. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.<ref name=FAsuspensions>For example, see [[The Football Association]]'s rules regarding player suspensions in FA competitions: {{cite web|title=DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES|url=http://www.thefa.com/~/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2015-16/031g_memorandum-of-disciplinary-procedures-_section-d.ashx |publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=1 February 2016}}</ref> Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.<ref>For example, the [[English Premier League]] fined and levied an 8-match suspension on [[Luis Suárez]] for [[Luis Suárez#Racial abuse incident|racially abusing]] [[Patrice Evra]]</ref> Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.<ref name=FAsuspensions/>

Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the English and Scottish leagues will often deduct 10 points from a team that enters [[Administration (British football)|financial administration]]. Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.

==Governing bodies==
{{See also|Association football around the world}}
[[File:FIFA-Headquarter.jpg|thumb| Headquarters of [[FIFA]], the world governing body of football]]
The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as [[futsal]] and [[beach soccer]]) is [[FIFA]]. The FIFA headquarters are located in [[Zürich]], Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:<ref name="confeds">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/confederations/ |title=Confederations |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref>

* Asia: [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC)
* Africa: [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF)
* Europe: [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA)
* North/Central America & Caribbean: [[CONCACAF|Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football]] (CONCACAF)
* Oceania: [[Oceania Football Confederation]] (OFC)
* South America: [[CONMEBOL|Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol/Confederação Sul-americana de Futebol]] (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)

National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the [[Fédération Camerounaise de Football]] in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the [[Scottish Football Association]] in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.<ref name="confeds"/>

While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the [[International Football Association Board]], where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.<ref name="IFAB works">{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/aboutifab.html |title=The IFAB: How it works |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref>

==International competitions==
{{main|List of association football competitions}}
[[File:Mecz Polska - Armenia 04 ssj 20070328.jpg|thumb|A [[Moment of silence|minute of silence]] before an international match]]
The major international competition in football is the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.<ref>The number of competing teams has varied over the history of the competition. The most recent changed was in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], from 24 to 32.</ref> The most recent edition of the tournament was the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in Brazil.

There has been a [[Football at the Summer Olympics|football tournament]] at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900, except at the 1932 games in [[1932 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/football-equipment-and-history?tab=1 |title=Football Equipment and History |publisher=International Olympic Committee (IOC) |accessdate=4 March 2011}}</ref> Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) had the same status as the World Cup.

[[File:Torres, Mata and Ramos Euro 2012 trophy 01.jpg|thumb|Spanish footballers celebrating winning the [[UEFA European Championship]]]]
After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] (UEFA), the [[Copa América]] (CONMEBOL), [[African Cup of Nations]] (CAF), the [[Asian Cup]] (AFC), the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] (CONCACAF) and the [[OFC Nations Cup]] (OFC). The [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current [[FIFA World Cup]] champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the [[UEFA Champions League]] in Europe and the [[Copa Libertadores]] in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Organising Committee strengthens FIFA Club World Cup format | publisher=FIFA| url=http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/releases/newsid=570740.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531094715/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/releases/newsid=570740.html| archivedate=31 May 2008|date=14 August 2007 | accessdate =7 October 2007}}</ref>

==Domestic competitions==
{{Main|Association football around the world}}
[[File:Arena Auf Schalke hosting Schalke 04 vs Dortmund in 2009.jpg|thumb|right|A match in the top football league in Germany]]
The governing bodies in each country operate [[league system]]s in a [[Domestic association football season|domestic season]], normally comprising several [[division (sport)|division]]s, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into [[Table (information)|table]]s, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a [[round-robin tournament]]. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to a lower division.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Scottish Journal of Political Economy |last=Fort |first=Rodney |date=September 2000 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=431–455 |doi=10.1111/1467-9485.00172 |journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy}}</ref>

The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in international club competitions in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named [[Apertura and Clausura]] (Spanish for ''Opening'' and ''Closing''), awarding a champion for each.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/latinamerica/story/Estudiantes-win-Argentina-Apertura-title |title=Estudiantes win Argentina Apertura title |date=13 December 2010 |newspaper=FoxSports |agency=Associated Press |quote=Under the system used in Argentina and most of Latin America, two season titles are awarded each year&nbsp;– the Apertura and Clausura.}}</ref> The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more "cup" competitions organised on a [[single elimination tournament|knock-out]] basis.

Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries and lower divisions, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues&nbsp;– the [[Bundesliga]] (Germany), [[Premier League]] (England),<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7321408.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |title= Premier League conquering Europe |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=27 May 2008 | first=Ian | last=Hughes}}</ref> [[La Liga]] (Spain), [[Serie A]] (Italy), and [[Ligue 1]] (France)&nbsp;– attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of £600 million/€763 million/US$1.185 billion.<ref>{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Louise |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/29/premierleague |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Leading clubs losing out as players and agents cash in |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

==Variants and casual play==
{{see also|Variants of association football|Street football}}
[[File:O Jogo Bonito (The Beautiful Game).webm|thumb|To many, football is more than just a sport: a video short on the many styles and ethnicities who play football.]]
Variants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. [[five-a-side football]]) play in non-field environments (i.e. [[beach soccer]], [[indoor soccer]], and [[futsal]]) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. [[paralympic association football]]).

One of the attractions of association football is that a [[Street football|casual game]] can be played with only minimal equipment&nbsp;– a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can often have team sizes that vary considerably from eleven-a-side, use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and are likely to be self-officiated by the players.
