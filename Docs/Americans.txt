In 1909, the Superior Court and the Department of Justice in Washington D.C. ruled on a case that redefined Middle Easterners and their racial distinction.  According to the Arab American Historical Foundation and the Los Angeles Herald, a case in which George Shishim a Lebanese policeman, arrested a "white" man, who claimed that because Shishim was Lebanese, he must not be racially "white", but rather "Chinese-Mongolian".<ref name="arabamericanhistory.org">[http://www.arabamericanhistory.org/archives/dept-of-justice-affirms-arab-race-in-1909/ "Dept. of Justice Affirms in 1909 Whether Syrians, Turks, and Arabs are of White or Yellow Race"] Arab American Historical Foundation.

Shishim said: "If I am a Mongolian, then so was Jesus, because we came from the same land."<ref name="arabamericanhistory.org"/> As noted in the 1909 publication of the "Proceedings of the Asiatic Exclusion League", the presiding Judge Hutton concluded that Syrians had descended from Hebrews, who descended from "the Semitic family of the '[[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Indo-Aryan race]]{{'"}}, but because the Mongol conquerors had killed the Syrian men, and interbred with the Syrian women, "western nations have been unable to restore [the Syrians'] original characteristics" (6).<ref>[https://ia801407.us.archive.org/5/items/asiaticexclusion00asia/asiaticexclusion00asia.pdf "Proceedings of the Asiatic Exclusion League"] San Francisco: November 1909. Pg. 6. Accessed December 14, 2015. "As to the Syrians, it must be admitted that for 1500 years before Christ they trace their descent from the Hebraic branch of the Semitic family of the Indo-Aryan race, but the Mongolian incursion of the first and thirteenth centuries, when the male Syrians were slain and the females taken to wife by their Mongol conquerors, so altered their racial composition that centuries of contact with the western nations have been unable to restore their original characteristics."</ref> Shishim won and was granted citizenship, and Middle Easterners were thereafter legally considered "white" in the United States.

However, in 1910, Congress passed a bill that defined "[[Armenians]], [[Assyrians]], and [[Jews]]" as "[[Asiatic]]s", while still approving their claims to citizenship.<ref>[https://ia801407.us.archive.org/5/items/asiaticexclusion00asia/asiaticexclusion00asia.pdf "Proceedings of the Asiatic Exclusion League"] Asiatic Exclusion League.

"Today, many American Jews retain an ambivalence about whiteness, despite the fact that the vast majority have benefited and continue to benefit from [ [[Passing (racial identity)|white-passing]] ] privilege. This ambivalence stems from many different places: a deep connection to a Jewish history of discrimination and otherness; a moral imperative to identify with the stranger; an anti-universalist impulse that does not want Jews to be among the "melted" in the proverbial melting pot; an experience of prejudice and awareness of the contingency of whiteness; a feeling that Jewish identity is not fully described by religion but has some ethnic/tribal component that feels more accurately described by race; and a discomfort with contemporary Jewish power and privilege."</ref>

Additionally, as modern scientific data improved, more information on the true origins and ethnic distinctions emerged. For example, studies have shown that Jews share more genetic relativity to other Jews around the world than to the surrounding non-Jewish ethnic groups.<ref>[http://forward.com/culture/155742/jews-are-a-race-genes-reveal/ "Jews Are a 'Race', Genes Reveal".] Entine, Jon.

The United States Census Bureau is presently finalizing the ethnic classification of MENA populations. In 2012, prompted in part by post-9/11 discrimination, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee petitioned the Department of Commerce's Minority Business Development Agency to designate the MENA populations as a minority/disadvantaged community.<ref name="usatoday.com"/> Following consultations with MENA organizations, the Census Bureau announced in 2014 that it would establish a new MENA ethnic category for populations from the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab world]], separate from the "white" classification that these populations had previously sought in 1909.

Although tabulated, "religious responses" were reported as a single total and not differentiated, despite totaling 1,089,597 in 2000.<ref name=ancestry2000/>

Independent organizations provide improved estimates of the total populations of races and ethnicities in the US using the raw data from the US Census and other surveys.

For example, although any respondents who self-identified as [[American Jews|Jewish]] were included under the religious responses in the census, as Jews are an [[ethnoreligious group]] with culture and ethnicity intertwined, estimates from the Mandell L. Berman Institute and the [[North American Jewish Data Bank]] put the total population of Jews between 5.34 and 6.16&nbsp;million in 2000 and around 6.54&nbsp;million in 2010.<ref name="brandeis.edu"/> Similarly, the Arab-American Institute estimated the population of Arab Americans at 3.7&nbsp;million in 2012.<ref name="Brown, Heather, Emily Guskin and Amy Mitchell">{{cite web|author1=Heather Brown|author2=Emily Guskin|author3=Amy Mitchell|url=http://www.journalism.org/2012/11/28/arabamerican-population-growth/|title=Arab-American Population Growth|work=Arab-American Media|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=November 28, 2012|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref>

===Some other race===
{{Main|Multiracial American}}

According to the [[2010 United States Census]], 6.2% or 19,107,368 Americans chose to self-identify with the "Some other race" category; the third most popular option. Also, 36.7% or 18,503,103 Hispanic/Latino Americans chose to identify as [[Race and ethnicity in the United States#Some other race|some other race]] as these Hispanic/Latinos may feel the U.S. Census does not describe their European and American Indian ancestry as they understand it to be.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin: 2010]</ref>
A significant portion of the Hispanic and Latino population self-identifies as [[Mestizo]], particularly the Mexican and Central American community. [[Mestizo]] is not a [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|racial category in the U.S. Census]], but signifies someone who has both European and American Indian ancestry.

A [[national personification]] is an [[anthropomorphism]] of a nation or its people; it can appear in both [[editorial cartoon]]s and propaganda.

[[Uncle Sam]] is a national personification of the United States and sometimes more specifically of the [[American government]], with the first usage of the term dating from the [[War of 1812]]. He is depicted as a stern elderly white man with white hair and a [[goatee]] beard, and dressed in clothing that recalls the design elements of the [[flag of the United States]] – for example, typically a [[top hat]] with red and white stripes and white stars on a blue band, and red and white striped trousers.

[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]] is a poetic name for the Americas and the feminine personification of the United States of America, made famous by African-American poet [[Phillis Wheatley]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1776. It has inspired the names of many persons, places, objects, institutions, and companies in the [[Western Hemisphere]] and beyond, including the [[District of Columbia]], the seat of government of the United States.

[[American English|English]] is the de facto [[national language]].

Religion in the United States has a high adherence level compared to other developed countries, as well as a diversity in beliefs. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the country's [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] prevents the Federal government from making any "law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof". The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] has interpreted this as preventing the government from having any authority in religion.

Several of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] were established by settlers who wished to practice their own religion without discrimination: the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established by English [[Puritan]]s, Pennsylvania by Irish and English [[Quakers]], Maryland by English and Irish Catholics, and Virginia by English [[Anglicans]]. Although some individual states retained established religious confessions well into the 19th century, the United States was the first nation to have no official state-endorsed religion.<ref>Feldman, Noah (2005). ''Divided by God''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, pg. 10 ("For the first time in recorded history, they designed a government with no established religion at all.")</ref> Modeling the provisions concerning religion within the [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom]], the framers of the Constitution rejected any religious test for office, and the First Amendment specifically denied the federal government any power to enact any law respecting either an establishment of religion or prohibiting its free exercise, thus protecting any religious organization, institution, or denomination from government interference. The decision was mainly influenced by European Rationalist and Protestant ideals, but was also a consequence of the pragmatic concerns of minority religious groups and small states that did not want to be under the power or influence of a national religion that did not represent them.<ref>Marsden, George M. 1990.

[[File:Motherhood and apple pie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Apple pie]] and [[baseball]] are icons of American culture.]]
The [[culture of the United States|American culture]] is primarily a [[Western culture]], but is influenced by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], [[African American|West African]], [[Asian American|Asian]], [[Polynesian American|Polynesian]] and [[Latin America|Latino]] cultures.

The United States of America has its own unique social and cultural characteristics, such as [[American English|dialect]], [[Music of the United States|music]], [[Visual art of the United States|arts]], [[Society of the United States|social habits]], [[Cuisine of the United States|cuisine]] and [[Folklore of the United States|folklore]].<ref name="Society in Focus" />

Its chief early [[Europe]]an influences came from [[English American|English]], [[Scottish American|Scottish]], [[Welsh American|Welsh]], and [[Irish American|Irish]] settlers of [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial America]] during [[Thirteen Colonies|British rule]]. [[Culture of the United Kingdom|British culture]], due to colonial ties with Britain that spread the English language, [[English law|legal system]] and other cultural inheritances, had a formative influence.<ref>{{cite book|author=Carlos E.

American culture includes both [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] elements, scientific and religious competitiveness, political structures, risk taking and free expression, materialist and moral elements. Despite certain consistent ideological principles (e.g. [[individualism]], [[egalitarianism]], faith in freedom and [[democracy]]), the American culture has a variety of expressions due to its geographical scale and demographic diversity.
