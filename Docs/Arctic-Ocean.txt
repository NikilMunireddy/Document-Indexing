==History==
For much of [[History of Europe|European history]], the north [[polar region]]s remained largely unexplored and their geography conjectural. [[Pytheas]] of [[Marseille|Massilia]] recorded an account of a journey northward in 325 BC, to a land he called "[[Thule|Eschate Thule]]", where the Sun only set for three hours each day and the water was replaced by a congealed substance "on which one can neither walk nor sail". He was probably describing loose sea ice known today as "[[Iceberg|growler]]s" or "bergy bits"; his "Thule" was probably [[Norway]], though the [[Faroe Islands]] or [[Shetland]] have also been suggested.<ref>[http://www.win.tue.nl/~engels/discovery/pytheas.html Pytheas] Andre Engels.

[[File:Map of the Arctic, 1780s - B&W.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Emanuel Bowen]]'s 1780s map of the Arctic features a "Northern Ocean".]]
Early [[Cartography|cartographer]]s were unsure whether to draw the region around the North Pole as land (as in [[Johannes Ruysch]]'s [[:File:Ruysch map.jpg|map of 1507]], or [[Gerardus Mercator]]'s [[:File:Mercator Septentrionalium Terrarum descriptio.jpg|map of 1595]]) or water (as with [[Martin Waldseemüller]]'s [[:File:UniversalisCosmographia.jpg|world map of 1507]]). The fervent desire of European merchants for a northern passage, the [[Northern Sea Route]] or the [[Northwest Passage]], to "[[Cathay]]" ([[China]]) caused water to win out, and by 1723 mapmakers such as [[Johann Homann]] featured an extensive "Oceanus Septentrionalis" at the northern edge of their charts.

The few expeditions to penetrate much beyond the [[Arctic Circle]] in this era added only small islands, such as [[Novaya Zemlya]] (11th century) and [[Spitzbergen]] (1596), though since these were often surrounded by [[Drift ice|pack-ice]], their northern limits were not so clear. The makers of [[Nautical chart|navigational chart]]s, more conservative than some of the more fanciful cartographers, tended to leave the region blank, with only fragments of known coastline sketched in.

This lack of knowledge of what lay north of the shifting barrier of ice gave rise to a number of conjectures. In England and other European nations, the [[Mythology|myth]] of an "[[Open Polar Sea]]" was persistent. [[Sir John Barrow, 1st Baronet|John Barrow]], longtime Second Secretary of the British [[Admiralty]], [[Arctic exploration|promoted exploration]] of the region from 1818 to 1845 in search of this.

In the [[United States]] in the 1850s and 1860s, the explorers [[Elisha Kane]] and [[Isaac Israel Hayes]] both claimed to have seen part of this elusive body of water. Even quite late in the century, the eminent authority [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]] included a description of the Open Polar Sea in his textbook ''The Physical Geography of the Sea'' (1883). Nevertheless, as all the explorers who travelled closer and closer to the pole reported, the [[polar ice cap]] is quite thick, and persists year-round.

[[Fridtjof Nansen]] was the first to make a [[Seamanship|nautical]] crossing of the Arctic Ocean, in 1896. The first surface crossing of the ocean was led by [[Wally Herbert]] in 1969, in a [[dog sled]] expedition from [[Alaska]] to [[Svalbard]], with air support.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/uk/sir+wally+herbert+dies/558357 Channel 4, "Sir Wally Herbert dies" 13 June 2007]</ref> The first nautical transit of the north pole was made in 1958 by the submarine [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS Nautilus]], and the first surface nautical transit occurred in 1977 by the [[icebreaker]] [[Arktika (icebreaker)|NS Arktika]].

Since 1937, Soviet and Russian manned [[drifting ice station]]s have extensively monitored the Arctic Ocean. Scientific settlements were established on the drift ice and carried thousands of kilometres by ice floes.<ref>[http://www.whoi.edu/beaufortgyre/history/history_drifting.html North Pole drifting stations (1930s–1980s)]</ref>

In [[World War II]], the European region of the Arctic Ocean was [[Arctic Ocean operations of World War II|heavily contested]]: the [[Arctic convoys|Allied commitment to resupply the Soviet Union via its northern ports]] was opposed by German naval and air forces.

The ocean's Arctic shelf comprises a number of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]], including the Canadian Arctic shelf, underlying the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago]], and the [[Continental shelf of Russia|Russian continental shelf]], which is sometimes simply called the "Arctic Shelf" because it is greater in extent. The Russian continental shelf consists of three separate, smaller shelves, the [[Barents Shelf]], [[Chukchi Sea Shelf]] and [[Siberian Shelf]]. Of these three, the Siberian Shelf is the largest such shelf in the world. The Siberian Shelf holds large oil and gas reserves, and the Chukchi shelf forms the border between Russian and the United States as stated in the [[USSR–USA Maritime Boundary Agreement]]. The whole area is subject to international [[Territorial claims in the Arctic|territorial claims]].

===Underwater features===
An [[Mid-ocean ridge|underwater ridge]], the [[Lomonosov Ridge]], divides the deep sea [[Arctic Basin|North Polar Basin]] into two [[oceanic basin]]s: the [[Eurasian Basin]], which is between {{convert|4000|and|4500|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep, and the [[Amerasian Basin]] (sometimes called the North American, or Hyperborean Basin), which is about {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} deep. The [[bathymetry]] of the ocean bottom is marked by [[fault block]] ridges, [[abyssal plain]]s, [[Oceanic trench|ocean deeps]], and basins. The average depth of the Arctic Ocean is {{convert|1038|m|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Mariana Trench – Oceanography| work=www.marianatrench.com | url=http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm | date=2003-04-04| accessdate=2006-12-02 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061207210451/http://www.marianatrench.com/mariana_trench-oceanography.htm| archivedate= 7 December 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The deepest point is [[Litke Deep]] in the Eurasian Basin, at {{convert|5450|m|abbr=on}}.

The two major basins are further subdivided by ridges into the [[Canada Basin]] (between Alaska/Canada and the [[Alpha Ridge]]), [[Makarov Basin]] (between the Alpha and Lomonosov Ridges), [[Nansen Basin]] (between Lomonosov and [[Gakkel Ridge|Gakkel]] ridges), and Nansen Basin ([[Amundsen Basin]]) (between the Gakkel Ridge and the continental shelf that includes the [[Franz Josef Land]]).

===Water flow===

The section sketches the different water masses along a vertical section from [[Bering Strait]] over the geographic [[North Pole]] to [[Fram Strait]].

In large parts of the Arctic Ocean, the top layer (about {{convert|50|m|abbr=on}}) is of lower salinity and lower temperature than the rest. It remains relatively stable, because the salinity effect on density is bigger than the temperature effect. It is fed by the freshwater input of the big Siberian and Canadian streams ([[Ob River|Ob]], [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]], [[Lena River|Lena]], [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie]]), the water of which quasi floats on the saltier, denser, deeper ocean water. Between this lower salinity layer and the bulk of the ocean lies the so-called [[halocline]], in which both salinity and temperature are rising with increasing depth.

Because of its relative isolation from other oceans, the Arctic Ocean has a uniquely complex system of water flow. It is classified as a mediterranean sea, which as “a part of the world ocean which has only limited communication with the major ocean basins (these being the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans) and where the circulation is dominated by thermohaline forcing”.<ref name=Tomczak>[Regional Oceanography: An Introduction. Tomczak, Godfrey. Retrieved 18 November 2013.]</ref>  The Arctic Ocean has a total volume of 18.07×10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup>, equal to about 1.3% of the World Ocean.  Mean surface circulation is predominately cyclonic on the [[Eurasian]] side and anticyclonic in the [[Canadian Basin]].<ref name=Talley>[Descriptive Physical Oceanography. Talley, Pickard, Emery, Swift. Retrieved 2 November 2013.]</ref>

Water enters from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and can be divided into three unique water masses. The deepest water mass is called Arctic Bottom Water and begins around 900 meters depth.<ref name=Tomczak /> It is composed of the densest water in the World Ocean and has two main sources: Arctic shelf water and Greenland Sea Deep Water. Water in the shelf region that begins as inflow from the Pacific passes through the narrow [[Bering Strait]] at an average rate of 0.8 Sverdrups and reaches the [[Chukchi Sea]].<ref name=Nature>[http://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/arctic-ocean-circulation-going-around-at-the-102811553 Arctic Ocean Circulation: Going Around at the Top of the World. Retrieved 2 November 2013.]</ref>  During the winter, cold Alaskan winds blow over the Chukchi Sea, freezing the surface water and pushing this newly formed ice out to the Pacific. The speed of the ice drift is roughly 1–4&nbsp;cm/s.<ref name=Talley /> This process leaves dense, salty waters in the sea that sink over the continental shelf into the western Arctic Ocean and create a [[halocline]].<ref name=Polar>[http://polardiscovery.whoi.edu/arctic/circulation.html Polar Discovery: Arctic Ocean Circulation. Retrieved 2 November 2013.]</ref>
[[File:Nares strait border (Kennedy channel).png|thumb|left| The [[Kennedy Channel]].]]
This water is met by Greenland Sea Deep Water, which forms during the passage of winter storms. As temperatures cool dramatically in the winter, ice forms and intense vertical convection allows the water to become dense enough to sink below the warm saline water below.<ref name=Tomczak />  Arctic Bottom Water is critically important because of its outflow, which contributes to the formation of Atlantic Deep Water. The overturning of this water plays a key role in global circulation and the moderation of climate.

In the depth range of 150–900 meters is a water mass referred to as Atlantic Water. Inflow from the [[North Atlantic Current]] enters through the [[Fram Strait]], cooling and sinking to form the deepest layer of the halocline, where it circles the [[Arctic Basin]] counter-clockwise.  This is the highest volumetric inflow to the Arctic Ocean, equaling about 10 times that of the Pacific inflow, and it creates the Arctic Ocean Boundary Current.<ref name=Nature /> It flows slowly, at about 0.02&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=Tomczak /> Atlantic Water has the same salinity as Arctic Bottom Water but is much warmer (up to 3&nbsp;°C). In fact, this water mass is actually warmer than the surface water, and remains submerged only due the role of salinity in density.<ref name=Tomczak />  When water reaches the basin it is pushed by strong winds into a large circular current called the [[Beaufort Gyre]]. Water in the Beaufort Gyre is far less saline than that of the Chukchi Sea due to inflow from large Canadian and Siberian rivers.<ref name=Polar />

The final defined water mass in the Arctic Ocean is called Arctic Surface Water and is found from 150–200 meters. The most important feature of this water mass is a section referred to as the sub-surface layer. It is a product of Atlantic water that enters through canyons and is subjected to intense mixing on the [[Siberian Shelf]].<ref name=Tomczak /> As it is entrained, it cools and acts a heat shield for the surface layer. This insulation keeps the warm Atlantic Water from melting the surface ice. Additionally, this water forms the swiftest currents of the Arctic, with speed of around 0.3-0.6&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=Tomczak /> Complementing the water from the canyons, some Pacific water that does not sink to the shelf region after passing through the Bering Strait also contributes to this water mass.

Waters originating in the Pacific and Atlantic both exit through the Fram Strait between [[Greenland]] and [[Svalbard Island]], which is about 2700 meters deep and 350 kilometers wide. This outflow is about 9 Sv.<ref name=Nature /> The width of the Fram Strait is what allows for both inflow and outflow on the Atlantic side of the Arctic Ocean. Because of this, it is influenced by the [[Coriolis force]], which concentrates outflow to the East Greenland Current on the western side and inflow to the [[Norwegian Current]] on the eastern side.<ref name=Tomczak /> Pacific water also exits along the west coast of Greenland and the [[Hudson Strait]] (1-2 Sv), providing nutrients to the Canadian Archipelago.<ref name=Nature />

As noted, the process of ice formation and movement is a key driver in Arctic Ocean circulation and the formation of water masses.  With this dependence, the Arctic Ocean experiences variations due to seasonal changes in sea ice cover. Sea ice movement is the result of wind forcing, which is related to a number of meteorological conditions that the Arctic experiences throughout the year.  For example, the Beaufort High—an extension of the [[Siberian High]] system—is a pressure system that drives the anticyclonic motion of the Beaufort Gyre.<ref name=Talley /> During the summer, this area of high pressure is pushed out closer to its Siberian and Canadian sides. In addition, there is a [[sea level pressure]] (SLP) ridge over Greenland that drives strong northerly winds through the Fram Strait, facilitating ice export. In the summer, the SLP contrast is smaller, producing weaker winds. A final example of seasonal pressure system movement is the low pressure system that exists over the Nordic and Barents Seas. It is an extension of the [[Icelandic Low]], which creates cyclonic ocean circulation in this area. The low shifts to center over the North Pole in the summer.  These variations in the Arctic all contribute to ice drift reaching its weakest point during the summer months.  There is also evidence that the drift is associated with the phase of the Arctic Oscillation and [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]].<ref name=Talley />

Icebergs occasionally break away from northern [[Ellesmere Island]], and icebergs are formed from [[glacier]]s in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada. These icebergs pose a hazard to ships, of which the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] is one of the most famous. [[Permafrost]] is found on most islands. The ocean is virtually icelocked from October to June, and the [[superstructure]] of ships are subject to [[Icing (nautical)|icing]] from October to May.<ref name=CIA/> Before the advent of modern [[icebreaker]]s, ships sailing the Arctic Ocean risked being trapped or crushed by sea ice (although the ''[[SS Baychimo|Baychimo]]'' drifted through the Arctic Ocean untended for decades despite these hazards).

Under the influence of the [[Quaternary glaciation]], the Arctic Ocean is contained in a [[polar climate]] characterized by persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges. Winters are characterized by the [[polar night]], extreme cold, frequent low-level temperature inversions, and stable weather conditions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Serreze|first1=Mark C|last2=Barry|first2=Roger G|title=The Arctic Climate System|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-107-03717-5|pages=168–172|edition=2nd}}</ref> [[Cyclone]]s are only common on the Atlantic side.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal|last1=Simmonds|first1=Ian|last2=Burke|first2=Craig|last3=Keay|first3=Kevin|title=Arctic climate change as manifest in cyclone behavior|journal=Journal of Climate|date=2008|volume=21|doi=10.1175/2008JCLI2366.1}}</ref> Summers are characterized by continuous [[daylight]] ([[midnight sun]]), and temperatures can rise above the melting point (0&nbsp;°C or 32&nbsp;°F).

The temperature of the surface of the Arctic Ocean is fairly constant, near the [[Melting point|freezing point]] of [[seawater]]. Because the Arctic Ocean consists of saltwater, the temperature must reach {{Convert|−1.8|C}} before freezing occurs.

The [[density]] of sea water, in contrast to fresh water, increases as it nears the freezing point and thus it tends to sink. It is generally necessary that the upper {{convert|100|–|150|m|abbr=on}} of ocean water cools to the freezing point for sea ice to form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nsidc.org/seaice/intro.html |title=NSIDC sea ice |accessdate=2010-02-10 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100117114629/http://nsidc.org/seaice/intro.html| archivedate= 17 January 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In the winter the relatively warm ocean water exerts a moderating influence, even when covered by ice. This is one reason why the Arctic does not experience the extreme temperatures seen on the [[Antarctica|Antarctic continent]].

There is considerable seasonal variation in how much pack ice of the Arctic ice pack covers the Arctic Ocean. Much of the Arctic ice pack is also covered in snow for about 10 months of the year. The maximum snow cover is in March or April — about {{convert|20|to|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} over the frozen ocean.

The climate of the Arctic region has varied significantly in the past. As recently as 55 million years ago, during the [[Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum]], the region reached an average annual temperature of {{convert|10|-|20|C|F}}.<ref name=Shellito2003>{{cite journal

==Animal and plant life==
[[File:Polar bears near north pole.jpg|thumb|Three [[polar bear]]s approach [[USS Honolulu (SSN-718)|USS ''Honolulu'']] near the [[North Pole]].]]
Endangered marine species in the Arctic Ocean include [[walrus]]es and [[whale]]s. The area has a fragile [[ecosystem]] which is slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions or damage.<ref name=CIA/> [[Lion's mane jellyfish]] are abundant in the waters of the Arctic, and the [[banded gunnel]] is the only species of [[Pholidae|gunnel]] that lives in the ocean.

The Arctic Ocean has relatively little plant life except for [[phytoplankton]].<ref>[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/341342/title/Microbes_flourish_under_Arctic_sea_ice ''Microbes flourish under Arctic sea ice; Scientists shocked to find phytoplankton thriving under frozen surface''] July 28th, 2012; Vol.182 #2 (p. 17) [[Science News]]</ref> Phytoplankton are a crucial part of the ocean and there are massive amounts of them in the Arctic, where they feed on nutrients from rivers and the [[Ocean current|currents]] of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.<ref name=NOAA>[http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/02arctic/background/physical/physical.html Physical Nutrients and Primary Productivity] Professor Terry Whiteledge.

As the extent of sea ice diminishes and sea level rises, the effect of storms such as the [[Great Arctic Cyclone of 2012]] on open water increases, as does possible salt-water damage to vegetation on shore at locations such as the Mackenzie's [[river delta]] as stronger [[storm surge]]s become more likely.<ref name=CC03513>{{cite news|title=Warmer Arctic with Less Ice Increases Storm Surge|url=http://www.climatecentral.org/news/warmer-arctic-with-less-ice-increases-storm-surge-15689|accessdate=March 8, 2013|newspaper=Climate Central|date=March 5, 2013|author=Lauren Morello}}</ref>

On July 16, 2015, five nations (United States of America, Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark/Greenland) signed a declaration committing to keep their fishing vessels out of a 1.1 million square mile zone in the central Arctic Ocean near the North Pole. The agreement calls for those nations to refrain from fishing there until there is better scientific knowledge about the marine resources and until a regulatory system is in place to protect those resources.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arctic deal bans North Pole fishing|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33549606|accessdate=16 July 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=16 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Rosen|first1=Yereth|title=5 nations sign declaration to protect Arctic 'donut hole' from unregulated fishing|url=https://www.adn.com/article/20150716/5-nations-sign-declaration-protect-arctic-donut-hole-unregulated-fishing|accessdate=16 July 2015|publisher=Alaska Dispatch News|date=16 July 2015}}</ref>
