The '''Australian national rugby league team''' (or the '''Kangaroos''') have represented Australia in senior men's [[rugby league football]] competition since the establishment of [[Rugby league in Australia|the 'Northern Union game' in Australia]] in 1908. Administered by the [[Australian Rugby League]], the Kangaroos are ranked second in the [[RLIF World Rankings]]. The team are the most successful in [[Rugby League World Cup]] history, having contested all 14 and winning 10 of them, failing to reach the final only once, in the [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|inaugural tournament]] in 1954. Only four nations have beaten Australia in test matches, and Australia have an overall win percentage of 67%.

Dating back to 1908, Australia are the fourth oldest national side after [[England national rugby league team|England]], [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] and [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]]. The team was first assembled in 1908 for a [[1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain|tour of Great Britain]].<ref>{{cite web|last=[[Australian Rugby League]] and [[National Rugby League]]|title=Rugby league|url=http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/whats_the_score/pdf/rugby_league.pdf|work=Australian Human Rights Commission Report|publisher=hreoc.gov.au|accessdate=13 May 2012}}</ref> The majority of the Kangaroos' games since then have been played against Great Britain and New Zealand. In the first half of the 20th century, Australia's international competition came from alternating tours to Great Britain and New Zealand, with Australia playing host to these teams in non-tour years. On tours to [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] (and later [[France national rugby league team|France]]), Australia was known as the Kangaroos. Great Britain dominated in the early years, and Australia did not win a Test against the Lions until 11 November 1911 under captain [[Chris McKivat]]. Australia did not win a series at home against Great Britain until 1920 or abroad until 1958.

Since 7 July 1994 the team's official nickname has been '''the Kangaroos''', though they had unofficially been referred to as such since 1908. Previously, the Australian team was only referred to as the Kangaroos when on tours of Great Britain or France. In [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|1997]] Australia was also represented by a ''Super League Australia'' team, drawing on players from that year's [[Super League (Australia)#Tests|Super League]] competition. While in the past players for the side had been selected from clubs in various leagues around the country, in recent years the side has consisted exclusively of players from clubs of the [[National Rugby League]].

==History==
{{align|right|{{RLIF World Rankings|Australia}}}}

{{See also|History of rugby league}}

[[Rugby football]] has been played in Australia since the 1860s. In 1863 [[Sydney University Football Club|Sydney University]] became the first rugby club to be formed in Sydney, and would play games amongst themselves or against the crews of visiting British ships. The Sydney Football Club (1865) and the [[Wallaroos]] (1870) followed, and inter-club competition commenced. By 1880, there were 100 clubs across the country, and rugby quickly became the dominant winter sport for Sydney.

In 1888 an English team visited [[Australasia]], playing rugby rules in Queensland, [[New South Wales]] and New Zealand, and [[Australian rules football]] in Victoria and South Australia. In 1899, an Australian team was formed for the first time using players from Queensland and New South Wales. They played a series of Tests against a British team.

===1900s===
By 1907, Sydney club rugby games were attracting up to 20,000 people, with all profits going to the [[New South Wales Rugby Union|Southern Rugby Football Union]], as the sport at the time was officially an amateur one. This caused discontent among players, and in 1908 the [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] and [[Queensland Rugby League]] were formed.

An Australian national rugby league team was first formed during the first season of [[rugby league in Australia]], the [[1908 NSWRFL Premiership]] season. The team, which was made of players from the NSWRFL with a few Queensland rugby rebels added, first played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|"professional All Blacks"]] on the return leg of their [[1907–08 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain|tour of Australia and Great Britain]].

Later that year the Australian team arranged to go on a tour of its own. The [[1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain|first Kangaroos]] arrived in England on 27 September 1908, and played their first ever test against the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] in December in London. It finished 22 all in front of a crowd of 2,000. The second test in Newcastle in January 1909 attracted a crowd of 22,000, and the Northern Union won 15–5. The third test was played at [[Villa Park]], Birmingham, the Northern Union winning again 6–5 before a crowd of 9,000. The Australians suggested that the series should be named 'The Ashes' after the cricket series of the same name.

In 1909, when the new "[[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]]" code was still in its infancy in Australia, a match between the Kangaroos and the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]] was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the Rugby League side winning 29–26.<ref>{{cite news

===1910s===
The first British tour of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] began on 4 June 1910, when the Northern Union played [[New South Wales]] in front of 33,000 spectators in Sydney, losing 28–14. But they won the first test in Sydney against Australia 27–20 in front of 42,000. They then won the second test in [[Brisbane]] 22–17. In [[Auckland]], on 30 July, they defeated New Zealand 52–20. The [[1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]] was the first ever, and Australia were beaten for the Ashes in two tests, faring slightly better as "[[Australasia rugby league team|Australasia]]" with two Kiwis added to their squad. The [[1911–12 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] was undertaken by an '[[Australasia rugby league team|Australasian]]' squad which included four New Zealanders. They won the Ashes for the first time and for the next half a century no other touring team would do so on British soil.

The [[1914 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand]] was the second time the British toured down under. The Australians, captained by Sid Deane for all three tests,<ref>{{cite web|last=Whiticker|first=Alan|title=Sid Deane|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/players/sid-deane/summary.html|work=rugbyleagueproject.org|publisher=Shawn Dollin, Andrew Ferguson and Bill Bates|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> got one victory but lost the series in the famous decider, the "Rorke's Drift Test".<ref>{{cite web|title=Player Profile – Wally Messenger|url=http://www.yesterdayshero.com.au/PlayerProfile_Wally-Messenger_5733.aspx|work=yesterdayshero.com.au|publisher=SmartPack International|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> Australia also went on a tour of New Zealand in 1919.

===1920s===
The [[1920 Great Britain Lions tour]] saw Australia win the [[Ashes series (rugby league)|Ashes]] for the first time on home soil. The [[1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] also included a New Zealander and was ostensibly an [[Australasia rugby league team|Australasian side]]. In January 1922, an "England" side defeated Australia 6–0 at [[The Willows, Salford|The Willows]], [[City of Salford|Salford]], to win back the Ashes that had been lost in 1920. They would not be lost again until 1950.

The Australian national team first wore green and gold in a hooped design, on Saturday 23 June 1928, when they met Great Britain in the first Test at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]]. Britain led 10–2 after 25&nbsp;minutes, 13–7 at half time and, after a nervous second half, eventually claimed the Test 15–12. The England team won both the 1928 series in Australia and New Zealand by two tests to one. They were presented with the Ashes Trophy by the Australians, which the two countries have competed for ever since.

The [[1929–30 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain]] was the fourth Kangaroo tour, and took the Australian team all around England and also into Wales. The tour also featured the ninth [[Ashes series (rugby league)|Ashes series]] which comprised four Test matches and was won by Great Britain.

===1930s===
The first test of the 1932 Ashes series between Australia and Great Britain drew a world record international rugby league attendance of 70,204 to the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. This attendance would stand as the world record until the 1992 World Cup Final played at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], and as of 2013 remains the record attendance for a rugby league test played in Australia. The [[Jim Sullivan (rugby league)|Jim Sullivan]] led Lions triumphed over the [[Herb Steinohrt]] led Australians 8–6.

On the 1933–34 tour New South Wales winger [[David Brown (rugby league)|Dave Brown]] played in 32 matches, including all 3 Tests, scoring 285 points, at the time the greatest number ever attained by an Australian player on tour.<ref>{{cite news

An exhibition match between Australia and Great Britain at Paris' [[Stade Pershing]] in December 1933 inspired the beginnings of [[rugby league in France]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lyle|first=Beaton|title=75 Years of French Rugby League|url=http://www.rleague.com/content/article.php?id=32875|accessdate=30 October 2011|newspaper=rleague.com|date=7 April 2009}}</ref>

===1940s===
[[Albert Johnston (rugby league)|Albert Johnston]] was a national selector in 1946 and coach of the national side for the 1946 first post-WWII Anglo-Australian series.
Australia's [[1948-49 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]] was their seventh tour to the UK. They played the [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes series]] against a side officially called Great Britain.

===1950s===

During the [[1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand]], Australia lost the three-Test series to the powerful French team inspired by their freakish goal kicking fullback [[Puig Aubert]].

The [[1954 Rugby League World Cup]] was the first such tournament held in either rugby code. Australia failed to reach the final.

For the 1956–57 [[Kangaroo tour]] a record eleven Queenslanders were selected in the touring squad. Great Britain defeated Australia 19–0 at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]], to take [[The Ashes (rugby league)|the Ashes]] series 2–1.

Australia hosted and won the [[1957 Rugby League World Cup|1957 World Cup]].

For the 1959–60 [[Kangaroo tour]] of Great Britain, the home nation retained the Ashes by winning the Test series 2–1 by the following results.

* First Test – Great Britain 14–22 Australia at Station Road, Swinton.
* Second Test – Great Britain 11–10 Australia at [[Headingley Carnegie Rugby Stadium|Headingley]], [[Leeds]].
* Third Test – Great Britain 18–12 Australia at [[Central Park (Wigan)|Central Park]], [[Wigan]].

This was the last British Ashes win on home soil.

===1960s===
For the [[1960 Rugby League World Cup|1960 World Cup]] no final was held, but the last game, which was between the previously undefeated [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]] and Australia sides, made it the tournament decider. Great Britain won 10–3.

[[Harry Bath]] was selected manager, coach and as the sole selector for the Australian national team's 1962 Ashes series.

After ten previous tours of Britain, the [[1963-64 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1963-64 Kangaroo tour]] saw Australia's first ever Ashes victory on British soil. The [[Arthur Summons]] coached Kangaroos won the first test at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] before rampaging to a famous 50-12 win in the second test at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]] in [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]]. Although they would lose the third test at Headingley, legendary winger [[Ken Irvine]] became the first Australian player to score a try in each test of an Ashes series. The Kangaroos have not lost a series in Britain since.<ref>{{cite web|last=sahof.org.au|title=Kangaroos Team (Rugby League) – 1963|url=http://www.sahof.org.au/awards/member-profile/?teamAwardID=10|work=Team Sport Australia Award|publisher=Sport Australia Hall of Fame|accessdate=27 November 2011}}</ref>

Harry Bath coached the national side to World Cup glory in the [[1968 Rugby League World Cup|1968 World Cup]]. He also coached the team on a tour of New Zealand in 1969.

===1970s===
The last time that Great Britain won the Ashes was in 1970. They won the series 2–1 in Australia. Out of 24 games played Great Britain won 22, drew one and lost one – making them the most successful British tourists so far. The 1970 Lions contained a galaxy of stars including captain [[Frank Myler]], [[Roger Millward]], [[Cliff Watson]] and [[Mal Reilly]]. Future Kangaroo Tour captain and later coach [[Bob Fulton]] made his test debut in the 1970 Ashes series (Fulton had actually played 3 games for Australia in the 1968 World Cup but at the time tests and World Cup games were classed differently). Harry Bath again coached Australia to victory in the [[1970 Rugby League World Cup|1970 World Cup Final]] in a brutal game that would become known as the "Battle of Headingley". Bath also coached the team on a tour of New Zealand in 1971. On that tour [[Geoff Starling]] became the youngest player to ever represent Australia. He was 18 years and 181 days old when playing a tour match against a New Zealand XIII at [[Huntly, New Zealand|Huntly]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Ritchie|first=Dean|title=Folau the youngest Roo|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/league/folau-the-youngest-roo/story-e6frf3ou-1111114570135|accessdate=2 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|date=5 October 2007}}</ref>

Australia lost the [[1972 World Cup]] to Great Britain in controversial circumstances. Australian captain [[Graeme Langlands]] was denied what seemed a fair try by being ruled offside by the French referee after catching a kick put up by halfback [[Dennis Ward (rugby league)|Dennis Ward]]. Film of the try showed Langlands was approximately a metre behind Ward when he kicked the ball. The French referee Georges Jameau's alleged reason for not awarding the try was that he did not believe anyone could have scored from an onside position. The World Cup final was tied at 10–10 after full-time and was still locked after extra time. Great Britain were awarded the victory due to a higher points table placing after the pool rounds of the competition.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6QneX1iBrI 1972 World Cup Final highlights]</ref>

On the [[1978 Kangaroo tour]], Great Britain defeated Australia in the second test at Bradford, 18–14, before a crowd of 26,447. It took ten years, and fifteen consecutive test defeats before Britain were able to defeat the Kangaroos again, starting with Australia's 3–0 whitewash of the Lions during their 1979 Australasian tour. However, the Australians were surprisingly defeated by the French team in both tests played at the end of the 1978 tour. This was the last defeat of the Kangaroos in a series until 2005.

===1980s===
The 1980s was the decade in which Australia began to truly dominate world rugby league. Along with the emergence of [[State of Origin series|State of Origin]] football came a new crop of superstar players who would lead Australia throughout the 1980s. Players such as [[Peter Sterling]], [[Mal Meninga]], [[Wayne Pearce]], [[Brett Kenny]], [[Eric Grothe, Sr.|Eric Grothe]] and [[Wally Lewis]] came to prominence on the [[1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]]. Australia's performance was taken into a new dimension by the tourists, also known as '[[The Invincibles (Rugby League)|the Invincibles]]', when they became the first team to win every game of the tour (fifteen games) including the first test by 40–4 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators. After the extremely poor showing during their 1979 Australasian tour, the Kangaroos rammed home just how far behind British football had fallen at [[Boothferry Park]]. The score was only 10-4 at half time, but after the break Australia's superior fitness showed and they ran in six unanswered tries to leave the crowd and British football stunned.

In 1983, [[Arthur Beetson]] became the first Aboriginal to coach the Australian team after [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] had stood down following the Kangaroo Tour. Although Australia won the first test against New Zealand at [[Carlaw Park]] in [[Auckland]], the Kiwis shocked by winning the return match 19-12 at Lang Park.

When the Lions toured in 1984, The Kangaroos again swept The Ashes series 3-0 under new team captain Wally Lewis, the first Queenslander to captain Australia since Arthur Beetson in 1974. Beetson was replaced as coach in 1984 by a returning Frank Stanton.

In 1985, Australia made a six-match tour of New Zealand under the coaching of [[Terry Fearnley]] who prior to the tour had coached NSW to its first ever [[1985 State of Origin series|Origin series]] win over Qld (the tour actually took place between games 2 and 3 of the Origin series). The Kangaroos won five of those matches, and the Test series 2–1. Australia won the first Test in Brisbane 26–20. On Sunday 30 June 1985, Australia met New Zealand in the second Test at [[Carlaw Park]], [[Auckland]]. The Test was a 20,000 sell-out, with all tickets accounted for weeks before the match. The Kiwis dominated long periods of the game but ninety seconds from time the Kiwis lost possession close to half way. [[John Ribot]] scored a try and Australia won 10–6. The tour ended in acrimony as tensions between coach Fearley and the Qld players, led by team captain Wally Lewis, reached boiling point with Lewis publicly stating that he had caught Fearnley and team vice-captain Wayne Pearce going over team selections in Fearnley's hotel room, though both Fearnley and Pearce denied the allegations. After the second test win Fearnley made 4 changes to the test team for the third and final test at Carlaw Park with all four players who were omitted being Queenslanders. The changes proved disastrous and NZ ran out easy 18-0 winners.

Following the tour, the Australian Rugby League decided that from then on the Kangaroos coach could not also double as the coach of either NSW or Qld in the same year.

Former Kangaroo [[Don Furner]] became Australian coach in 1986 and immediately formed a good working relationship with Wally Lewis and the players. The now harmonious Australians swept New Zealand 3-0 in a [[1986 Trans-Tasman Test series|mid-season test series]] played in Australia.

During the [[1986 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France]] a then record northern hemisphere crowd of 50,383 attended the first test of the Ashes series at [[Old Trafford]] with the Walle Lewis led Australians winning 38–16. On 16 December 1986 the Kangaroos set a new record for largest-ever winning margin in a Test match at 52–0 against [[France national rugby league team|France]]. In their two Tests against France, the Australians ran in 96 points<ref>{{cite news

This became the second consecutive tour of Europe in which Australia had won all their games. By the end of the tour, [[Terry Lamb]] had become the first player to appear in every match on a Kangaroo Tour. For this tour Wally Lewis, [[Greg Dowling]], [[Bob Lindner]], [[Gene Miles]] ([[Wynnum Manly Seagulls|Wynnum Manly]]) and [[Bryan Neibling]] ([[Redcliffe Dolphins|Redcliffe]]) became the last players selected to tour from the [[Brisbane Rugby League]] competition. By being named as tour captain, Wally Lewis became the first Queenslander to captain a Kangaroo Tour since [[Tom Gorman (rugby league)|Tom Gorman]] in 1929/30.

Australia crashed to a defeat on Tuesday 21 July 1987, when the Kangaroo dominance of the international game suffered a setback. New Zealand were their opponents in a match at Lang Park which had been arranged to fill the gap created by the non-appearance of France. New Zealand won the game 13–6. The next four internationals between Australia and New Zealand were all staged in New Zealand, and all were won by the Kangaroos.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/australia-vs-new-zealand-1987/australia-vs-new-zealand.html 1987 Australia vs New Zealand at Rugby League Project]</ref>

During the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour]] the Ashes were successfully retained by Australia by winning the first two Tests, however Great Britain won the third test 26-12 at the [[Sydney Football Stadium]], ending a winning streak between the two teams that stretched back to 1978. Later that month, Australia's 62-point win over [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] set a new record for largest winning margin in international rugby league. Australian dual international winger [[Michael O'Connor (rugby)|Michael O'Connor]] also set a new record for most points scored by an individual in international rugby league (30 points - 4 tries, 7 goals).<ref>{{cite news|title=O'Connor helps set Test records|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r3BVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=fpYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3512,275171|accessdate=18 October 2013|newspaper=[[The Age]]|date=21 July 1988}}</ref> The [[1985–1988 Rugby League World Cup]] culminated in the final against New Zealand at Auckland's [[Eden Park]] ground (the home of NZ rugby union).

Fulton's first series in charge of the Australian team saw them sweep New Zealand 3-0 during their 1989 tour.

===1990s===
With Wally Lewis controversially ruled unfit for the [[1990 Kangaroo tour]], his Queensland team mate [[Mal Meninga]] took over the Australian captaincy. The Ashes got off to a bad start for the Kangaroos when Great Britain shocked Australia to win the first test 19–12 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in front of a new record home crowd of 54,567. The second test at Old Trafford in [[Manchester]] was a tight affair that saw two of the most famous tries scored in test match football. Debutante 5/8 [[Cliff Lyons]] second half try came after the Kangaroos kept the ball alive through 13 sets of hands before winger [[Andrew Ettingshausen]] centre kicked for Lyons to score. With the scores tied at 10-all going into injury time and the Kangaroos pinned just 15 metres from their line, [[Ricky Stuart]] set off on an 75-metre run before passing to Meninga for the winning try only seconds from full-time to give Australia a 14-10 win.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11y0Sk7EoDU 1990 Great Britain vs Australia - Mal Meninga 2nd Test try]</ref> The Kangaroos then wrapped up The Ashes with a comprehensive 14-0 win in the third test at Elland Road in Leeds. Meninga as captain became just the third Australian (after [[Ken Irvine]] in 1963-64 and [[Sam Backo]] in 1988) to score a try in each test of an Ashes series.

Australia faced New Zealand in a three-game [[1991 Trans-Tasman Test series|mid-season Test series]] in 1991. The first test, played at the [[Olympic Park Stadium]] in [[Melbourne]] (the first rugby league test played in Australia outside of NSW or Qld) saw the Kiwis again defeat Australia after a successful Kangaroo tour. NZ won the first test 24-8 in Melbourne in front of 26,900 fans, however a new look Australian side came back to win the second test 44-0 in Sydney and the third test 40-12 in Brisbane.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/australia-vs-new-zealand-1991/summary.html 1991 Australia vs New Zealand at Rugby League Project]</ref>

During the [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia]] the British lost the first test 22–6 in Sydney, won the 2nd Ashes test 33–10 in Melbourne, but lost the 3rd test 16–10 in Brisbane. The [[1992 Rugby League World Cup final]] at Wembley Stadium set a then international attendance record for a rugby league international of 73,631. The [[Bob Fulton]] coached, Mal Meninga captained Australians defeat Great Britain 10–6 to win their 7th [[Rugby League World Cup]] title.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/world-cup-1989/final/great-britain-vs-australia.html 1992 World Cup Final at Rugby League Project]</ref>

Australia again played a mid-season test series against New Zealand in 1993. The first test at the [[Mt Smart Stadium]] in Auckland ended in a 14-all draw thanks to a late [[Laurie Daley]] field goal. Daley had captained Australia for the first time in the match following a two-game suspension to Mal Meninga. The Kangaroos then won the second test 16-8 at the [[Palmerston North Showgrounds]] before wrapping up the series with a 16-4 win at Lang Park in Brisbane.

On 4 July 1994, Australia defeated France 58-0 at the [[Parramatta Stadium]] in Sydney.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/matches/france-vs-australia-1994/australia-vs-france.html 1994 Australia vs France at Rugby League Project]</ref> The [[1994 Kangaroo Tour]] was the last time the Australian national team played matches against British provincial teams, in addition to the Tests. Australia continued its dominance, winning both Test series against Great Britain and France, suffering only one loss (against Great Britain in the First Test at Wembley), and remained undefeated against British club outfits in a streak stretching back to 1978. Australia adopted the name 'Kangaroos' for the July test against France, since then the team has been officially known by this name.

The Australian team that contested and won the [[1995 Rugby League World Cup]] consisted only of players from clubs that remained loyal to the Australian Rugby League during the [[Super League war]]. This meant several players from Super League-aligned clubs that were already well-established internationals were not selected for the World Cup squad. During 1995, the Kangaroos defeated New Zealand 3-0 in the [[1995 Trans-Tasman Test series|Trans-Tasman Test series]] played in Australia. As they would be for the World Cup, only ARL loyal players were selected for Australia which saw a number of players, including [[Steve Menzies]], [[Mark Coyne (rugby league)|Mark Coyne]], [[Terry Hill]], [[Gary Larson (rugby league)|Gary Larson]], [[Trevor Gillmeister]] and [[Jason Smith (rugby league)|Jason Smith]] make their test debuts.

In 1997 also, due to the [[Super League war]], Australian rugby league was split down the middle by two competitions: the ARL's [[Optus Cup]] and Super League's [[Telstra Cup]]. As a result, that season there were also two Australian sides:<ref>{{cite news

===2000s===
The new millennium started with the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup|2000 World Cup]] which Australia won.

In 2001 the Australians arrived in Britain for the first Ashes series since 1994. Great Britain surprised everyone by winning the first test, but lost the next two.

In July 2002, Australia handed Great Britain their worst ever test defeat by defeating them 64–10 in a Sydney test match.

In 2003 the [[New Zealand Rugby League]] counted its 100th international match against Australia, because they take [[Rugby League World Cup|World Cup]] matches and [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] tests into account.<ref>{{cite news

In November 2003, Great Britain lost an Ashes series 0–3 on home soil. The margin was extremely small in each game, 22–18 in game 1, 23–20 in game 2 and 18–12 in game 3 and it was known as [[Brett Kimmorley]]'s greatest series as he orchestrated Australia's last minute victories. However, the dominance of the Australian team over the last generation has begun to slip since 2003.

In 2003 and 2005 New Zealand won the Bill Kelly Memorial Trophy from Australia. Australia won the first two [[Rugby League Tri-Nations]] competitions in 1999 and 2004, before being defeated by New Zealand in the final of the [[2005 Tri-nations|2005 competition]] on 26 November 2005.<ref>{{Cite news

They did not lose a match until the final, which they lost to New Zealand, who became world champions for the first time. Following this loss, [[Ricky Stuart]] was replaced as coach by [[Tim Sheens]], then the most experienced NRL coach.

===2010s===
Australia lost the [[2010 Four Nations]] final to New Zealand.

The Kangaroos won the [[2011 Four Nations]] final against England.

The [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]] was held in Britain and was won by Australia after defeating New Zealand in front of the largest rugby league international attendance in history.

For their first twenty odd years of international competition, the Kangaroos' jersey was in a state of flux. When playing in Australia the team would wear sky-blue or maroon, depending on whether they were playing in New South Wales or Queensland. On tours, Australia would wear either the sky blue of New South Wales (as the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] organised the tours) or a maroon and sky blue hooped design.

In 1924 the decision was taken to change the national jersey's colours to green and gold. A green jersey with gold bands was used for Australia's next Test series in 1928, making the 1928 Kangaroos the first Australian representative rugby league team to adopt these colours. This design was revived for 25 July 2003 Test against [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]]. In 1929 the current design, which is green with two gold chevrons, was adopted and first used.

The original blue and maroon broken striped design was revived in 1963 when Australia hosted a touring [[South Africa national rugby league team|South African rugby league team]] who wore green and gold,<ref>{{Cite news

It was again used in the [[2014 Rugby League Four Nations|2014 Four Nations]] against [[England national rugby league team|England]] on 2 November 2014 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the "Rorke's Drift Test".

Since 2013, Australia's kits have been supplied by [[Canterbury of New Zealand]]. They replaced [[Classic]] who lasted between late 1999 to 2012. Classic had also supplied the kits during the early 1990s.

===Indigenous contribution to the Kangaroos===
The indigenous contribution to the Kangaroos is unmatched in Australian national sporting teams.

By way of example, Lionel Morgan was the first indigenous player in any Australian national sporting team in 1960, while Arthur Beetson was the first indigenous captain of any Australian national sporting team in 1973.

Remarkably given the 2% indigenous rate of population in Australia, the Kangaroos fielded a run-on team against New Zealand in the [[2015 Anzac Test]] with 7 of the 13 players having indigenous heritage (a staggering 54%). This contrasts markedly to nearly every other Australian national sporting team as at 2015.

===War cry===
From 1908 to 1967, the Australian team performed a war cry before Tests played in Great Britain and France. The war cry was first performed when the Kangaroos arrived at [[Tilbury]] Docks near London. It was developed after war cries had been performed on tours of Britain by the New Zealand [[All Blacks]] in 1905, the South African [[Springboks]] in 1906 and the New Zealand [[1907-1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Great Britain|All Golds]] in 1907. It is believed that the war cry is derived from an indigenous chant on [[Stradbroke Island]], Queensland, Australia.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The war cry was performed for the first time in over 40 years before the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup|Rugby League World Cup]] exhibition game between the Indigenous Dreamtime Team vs. the New Zealand Maōris in 2008. The war cry had not been performed by the Kangaroos since December 1967 in France.
