Its low elevation on the [[Nile delta]] makes it highly vulnerable to rising sea levels. Alexandria is Egypt's largest seaport, serving approximately 80% of Egypt's imports and exports.  It is an important industrial center because of its [[natural gas]] and [[Pipeline transport|oil pipeline]]s from [[Suez]]. Alexandria is also an important tourist destination.

Alexandria was founded around a small [[Ancient Egypt]]ian town ''c.'' 331 BC by [[Alexander the Great]]. It became an important center of the [[Hellenistic civilization]] and remained the capital of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Hellenistic]] and [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman and Byzantine Egypt]] for almost 1000 years until the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]] in AD 641, when a new capital was founded at [[Fustat]] (later absorbed into [[Cairo]]). Hellenistic Alexandria was best known for the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria]] (''Pharos''), one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]; its [[Great Library]] (the largest in the ancient world; now replaced by a [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina|modern one]]); and the [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Necropolis]], one of the [[Wonders of the Middle Ages|Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages]]. Alexandria was the second most powerful city of the ancient world after [[Rome]]. Ongoing [[maritime archaeology]] in the harbor of Alexandria, which began in 1994, is revealing details of Alexandria both before the arrival of Alexander, when a city named [[Rhacotis]] existed there, and during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

From the late 18th century, Alexandria became a major center of the international shipping industry and one of the most important trading centers in the world, both because it profited from the easy overland connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the [[Red Sea]], and the lucrative trade in [[Egyptian cotton]].

===Ancient era===

[[File:Alexander1256.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander The Great]]|200px]]

Alexandria was founded by [[Alexander the Great]] in April 331 BC as {{lang|grc|Ἀλεξάνδρεια}} (''Alexandria''). Alexander's chief architect for the project was [[Dinocrates]]. Alexandria was intended to supersede [[Naucratis]] as a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] center in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich [[Nile]] valley.

Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural center of the ancient world for some time. The city and its museum attracted many of the greatest scholars, including Greeks, Jews and Syrians. The city was later plundered and lost its significance.<ref name="FPAl">{{cite web |url=http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/12/23/lighthouse-dims-egypt-alexandria-salafists-mubarak-sisi-longform/ |title=The Lighthouse Dims |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |date=23 December 2014}}</ref>

Just east of Alexandria (where [[Abu Qir Bay]] is now), there was in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of [[Canopus, Egypt|Canopus]] and [[Heracleion]]. The latter was recently rediscovered under water.

An Egyptian city, [[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]], already existed on the shore also, and later gave its name to Alexandria in the [[Egyptian language]] (Egyptian '''*Raˁ-Ḳāṭit''', written ''rˁ-ḳṭy.t'', 'That which is built up'). It continued to exist as the Egyptian quarter of the city. A few months after the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to his city. After Alexander's departure, his viceroy, [[Cleomenes of Naucratis|Cleomenes]], continued the expansion. Following a struggle with the other successors of Alexander, his general [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] succeeded in bringing Alexander's body to Alexandria, though it was eventually lost after being separated from its burial site there.<ref>O'Connor, Lauren (2009) "The Remains of Alexander the Great: The God, The King, The Symbol," ''Constructing the Past'': Vol. 10: Iss. 1, Article 8</ref>

Although Cleomenes was mainly in charge of overseeing Alexandria's continuous development, the ''[[Heptastadion]]'' and the mainland quarters seem to have been primarily Ptolemaic work. Inheriting the trade of ruined [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] and becoming the center of the new commerce between Europe and the [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabian]] and Indian East, the city grew in less than a generation to be larger than [[Carthage]]. In a century, Alexandria had become the largest city in the world and, for some centuries more, was second only to Rome. It became Egypt's main Greek city, with [[Greeks|Greek people]] from diverse backgrounds.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Erskine |journal=Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: the Museum and Library of Alexandria |title=Greece & Rome, 2nd Ser., |volume=42 |issue=1 |date=April 1995 |pages=38–48 [42] |quote=One effect of the newly created Hellenistic kingdoms was the imposition of Greek cities occupied by Greeks on an alien landscape. In Egypt, there was a native Egyptian population with its own culture, history, and traditions. The Greeks who came to Egypt, to the court or to live in Alexandria, were separated from their original cultures. Alexandria was the main Greek city of Egypt and within it there was an extraordinary mix of Greeks from many cities and backgrounds.}}</ref>

Alexandria was not only a center of [[Hellenistic period|Hellenism]], but was also home to the largest urban Jewish community in the world. The [[Septuagint]], a Greek version of the [[Tanakh]], was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning ([[Library of Alexandria]]), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and [[Egyptians|Egyptian]].<ref name="Culture and Power in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] p. 42-43">{{cite journal |first=Andrew |last=Erskine |journal=Culture and Power in Ptolemaic Egypt: the Museum and Library of Alexandria |title=Greece & Rome, 2nd Ser., |volume=42 |issue=1 |year=1995 |date=April 1994 |pages=38–48 [42–43] |quote=The Ptolemaic emphasis on Greek culture establishes the Greeks of Egypt with an identity for themselves. […] But the emphasis on Greek culture does even more than this – these are Greeks ruling in a foreign land. The more Greeks can indulge in their own culture, the more they can exclude non-Greeks, in other words Egyptians, the subjects whose land has been taken over. The assertion of Greek culture serves to enforce Egyptian subjection. So the presence in Alexandria of two institutions devoted to the preservation and study of Greek culture acts as a powerful symbol of Egyptian exclusion and subjection. Texts from other cultures could be kept in the library, but only once they had been translated, that is to say Hellenized.<br/>[…] A reading of Alexandrian poetry might easily give the impression that Egyptians did not exist at all; indeed Egypt itself is hardly mentioned except for the Nile and the Nile flood, […] This omission of the Egypt and Egyptians from poetry masks a fundamental insecurity. It is no coincidence that one of the few poetic references to Egyptians presents them as muggers.}}</ref>

In AD 115, large parts of Alexandria were destroyed during the [[Kitos War]], which gave [[Hadrian]] and his architect, [[Decriannus]], an opportunity to rebuild it. In 215, the [[Roman Emperor|emperor]] [[Caracalla]] visited the city and, because of some insulting [[satire]]s that the inhabitants had directed at him, abruptly commanded his troops to [[Capital punishment|put to death]] all youths capable of bearing arms. On 21 July 365, Alexandria was devastated by a [[tsunami]] ([[365 Crete earthquake]]),<ref name="Ammianus Marcellinus, 26.10.15-19">'''[[Hana k.]]''', [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/ammianus_26_book26.htm#C10 "Res Gestae", 26.10.15–19]</ref> an event annually commemorated years later as a "day of horror."<ref>Stiros, Stathis C.: “The AD 365 Crete earthquake and possible seismic clustering during the fourth to sixth centuries AD in the Eastern Mediterranean: a review of historical and archaeological data”, ''Journal of Structural Geology'', Vol. 23 (2001), pp. 545–562 (549 & 557)</ref>

The [[Islamic prophet]], Muhammad's first interaction with the people of Egypt was during the [[Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma)]]. He sent Hatib bin Abi Baltaeh with a letter to the king of [[Egypt]] and Alexandria called [[Muqawqis]]<ref>Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ppPqzawIrIC&pg=PA222 The Sealed Nectar], p. 222</ref><ref name=history>[Akbar Shāh Ḵẖān Najībābādī, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=L8VHVM-lPNT77Aaiw4CICw&id=Pi5tAAAAMAAJ&dq=kalbi History of Islam, Volume 1], p. 194.

Salit bin Amri to Hozah bin Ali— the king of Yamama; Shiya bin Wahab to Haris bin Ghasanni to the king of Damascus"</ref> In the letter Muhammad said: "I invite you to accept Islam, Allah the sublime, shall reward you doubly. But if you refuse to do so, you will bear the burden of the transgression of all the Copts". During this expedition one of Muhammad's envoys [[Dihyah Kalbi|Dihyah bin Khalifa Kalbi]] was attacked, Muhammad sent [[Zayd ibn Haritha]] to help him. Dihya approached the Banu Dubayb (a tribe which converted to Islam and had good relations with Muslims) for help. When the news reached Muhammad, he immediately dispatched [[Zayd ibn Haritha]] with 500 men to battle. The Muslim army fought with Banu Judham, killed several of them (inflicting heavy casualties), including their chief, Al-Hunayd ibn Arid and his son, and captured 1000 camels, 5000 of their cattle and a 100 women and boys. The new chief of the [[Banu Judham]] who had embraced Islam appealed to Muhammad to release his fellow tribesmen, and Muhammad released them.<ref name=mubarakpuri >{{citation|title=The Sealed Nectar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ppPqzawIrIC&printsec=frontcover| first=Saifur Rahman Al|last=Mubarakpuri|year=2005|publisher=Darussalam Publications|page=226}} ([http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch5s2.html online])</ref><ref name=wattmim >{{cite book|authors=[[Montgomery Watt|Watt, W.

Another clan of Judham, however, or some men from another tribe, forced al-Hunayd to give the things back. Meanwhile a leader of Judham, Rifa'ah b. Zayd, had been in Medina, had brought back to the tribe Muhammad's terms for an alliance, and the tribe had accepted. Muhammad had not been informed of this decision, however, and sent out Zayd b. Harithah to avenge the insult to his messenger. There was a skirmish in which the Muslims killed al-Hunayd and captured a number of women and animals. }} ([https://archive.org/details/muhammadatmedina029655mbp free online])</ref>

[[File:Antoine-Jean Gros - Bataille d'Aboukir, 25 juillet 1799 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of Abukir'', by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] 1806.|300px]]
In 619, Alexandria [[Sassanid conquest of Egypt|fell]] to the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]]. Although the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Heraclius]] recovered it in 629, in 641 the Arabs under the general [['Amr ibn al-'As]] captured it during the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], after a siege that lasted 14 months.

After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under [[Ottoman Egypt|Ottoman rule]] until 1798. Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of [[Rosetta]] during the 9th to 18th centuries, and only regained its former prominence with the construction of the [[Mahmoudiyah Canal]] in 1807.

Alexandria figured prominently in the military operations of [[Napoleon]]'s [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|expedition to Egypt]] in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory over the French at the [[Battle of Alexandria]] on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 1801. [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to something akin to its former glory.<ref>"Modern"{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C0111760/modern.htm |title=The History of Alexandria |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref> Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.<ref name="FPAl"/>

In July 1882, the city came under bombardment from British naval forces and was occupied.

In July 1954, the city was a target of an Israeli bombing campaign that later became known as the [[Lavon Affair]]. On 26 October 1954, Alexandria's Mansheya Square was the site of a failed assassination attempt on [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].<ref>Ted Thornton, "Nasser Assassination Attempt, October 26, 1954," Middle East History Database{{cite web |url=http://www.nmhtthornton.com/mehistorydatabase/nasser_assassination_attempt.php |title=Nasser Assassination Attempt, October 26, 1954 |deadurl=no |accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>

Europeans began leaving Alexandria following the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] that led to an outburst of Arab nationalism. The nationalization of European property by Nasser, which reached its highest point in 1961, drove out nearly all the rest.<ref name="FPAl"/>

===Layout of the ancient city===

[[File:Macedonian Army Alexander.jpg|thumb|[[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] Army]]

Greek Alexandria was divided into three regions:
;Brucheum
:the Royal or Greek quarter, forming the most magnificent portion of the city. In [[Outline of ancient Rome|Roman times]] Brucheum was enlarged by the addition of an official quarter, making four regions in all. The city was laid out as a grid of parallel streets, each of which had an attendant subterranean canal;
;The Jewish quarter
:forming the northeast portion of the city;
;Rhakotis
:The old city of [[Rhacotis|Rhakotis]] that had been absorbed into Alexandria was occupied chiefly by Egyptians. (from [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Rakotə'' "Alexandria").

Two main streets, lined with [[colonnade]]s and said to have been each about {{convert|sp=us|60|m|ft}} wide, intersected in the center of the city, close to the point where the Sema (or Soma) of Alexander (his [[Mausoleum]]) rose. This point is very near the present [[mosque]] of [[Nebi Daniel]]; and the line of the great East–West "Canopic" street, only slightly diverged from that of the modern Boulevard de Rosette (now Sharia Fouad). Traces of its pavement and canal have been found near the Rosetta Gate, but remnants of streets and canals were exposed in 1899 by German excavators outside the east fortifications, which lie well within the area of the ancient city.

Alexandria consisted originally of little more than the island of Pharos, which was joined to the mainland by a [[mole (architecture)|mole]] nearly a mile long (1260 metres) and called the ''Heptastadion'' ("seven stadia"—a ''[[stadium]]'' was a Greek [[unit of length]] measuring approximately {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=off}}). The end of this abutted on the land at the head of the present Grand Square, where the "Moon Gate" rose. All that now lies between that point and the modern "Ras al-Tin" quarter is built on the silt which gradually widened and obliterated this mole. The Ras al-Tin quarter represents all that is left of the island of Pharos, the site of the actual lighthouse having been weathered away by the sea. On the east of the mole was the Great Harbor, now an open bay; on the west lay the port of Eunostos, with its inner basin Kibotos, now vastly enlarged to form the modern harbor.

In [[Strabo]]'s time, (latter half of the 1st century BC) the principal buildings were as follows, enumerated as they were to be seen from a ship entering the Great Harbor.

#The [[Palace|Royal Palaces]], filling the northeast angle of the town and occupying the promontory of Lochias, which shut in the Great Harbor on the east. Lochias (the modern Pharillon) has almost entirely disappeared into the sea, together with the palaces, the "Private Port," and the island of Antirrhodus. There has been a land [[subsidence]] here, as throughout the northeast coast of Africa.
#The Great Theater, on the modern Hospital Hill near the Ramleh station. This was used by [[Julius Caesar]] as a fortress, where he withstood a siege from the city mob after he took Egypt after the [[battle of Pharsalus]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}{{clarify|reason=Caesar retreated from a mob??|date=July 2014}}
#The [[Poseidon]], or [[Greek temple|Temple]] of the Sea God, close to the theater
#The Timonium built by [[Mark Antony|Marc Antony]]
#The Emporium (Exchange)
#The Apostases (Magazines)
#The Navalia (Docks), lying west of the Timonium, along the seafront as far as the mole
#Behind the Emporium rose the Great Caesareum, by which stood the two great [[obelisk]]s, which become known as “[[Cleopatra's Needle]]s,” and were transported to New York City and London. This temple became, in time, the Patriarchal Church, though some ancient remains of the temple have been discovered. The actual Caesareum, the parts not eroded by the waves, lies under the houses lining the new seawall.
#The [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|Gymnasium]] and the [[Palaestra]] are both inland, near the Boulevard de Rosette in the eastern half of the town; sites unknown.
#The Temple of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]; site unknown.
#The Mausolea of Alexander (Soma) and the Ptolemies in one ring-fence, near the point of intersection of the two main streets.
#The [[Musaeum]] with its famous [[Library of Alexandria|Library]] and theater in the same region; site unknown.
#The [[Serapeum]], the most famous of all Alexandrian temples. Strabo tells us that this stood in the west of the city; and recent discoveries go far as to place it near “Pompey's Pillar,” which was an independent monument erected to commemorate [[Diocletian]]'s siege of the city.

The names of a few other public buildings on the mainland are known, but there is little information as to their actual position. None, however, are as famous as the building that stood on the eastern point of Pharos island. There, [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|The Great Lighthouse]], one of the [[Wonders of the World|Seven Wonders of the World]], reputed to be {{convert|138|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, was situated. The first [[Ptolemy]] began the project, and the second Ptolemy ([[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]]) completed it, at a total cost of 800&nbsp;[[Talent (measurement)|talent]]s. It took 12&nbsp;years to complete and served as a [[prototype]] for all later [[lighthouse]]s in the world. The light was produced by a furnace at the top and the tower was built mostly with solid blocks of limestone. The Pharos lighthouse was destroyed by an earthquake in the 14th century, making it the second longest surviving ancient wonder, after the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. A temple of [[Hephaestus]] also stood on Pharos at the head of the mole.

In the 1st century, the population of Alexandria contained over 180,000 adult male citizens{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} (from a papyrus dated 32 AD), in addition to a large number of freedmen, women, children and slaves. Estimates of the total population range from 216,000<ref>[[Josiah Russell]], 1958, "Late Ancient and Medieval Population," pp. 67 and 79.</ref> to 500,000<ref>[[Elio Lo Cascio]], 2009, "Urbanization as a Proxy of Growth," p. 97 citing Bagnall and Frier.</ref> to over 1,000,000,{{dubious|date=January 2015}} making it one of the largest cities ever built before the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the largest pre-industrial city that was not an imperial capital.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Ancient remains==

[[File:Alex Sawary.jpg|thumb|right|Roman [[Pompey's Pillar (column)|Pompey's Pillar]]]]
Due to the constant presence of war in Alexandria in ancient times, very little of the ancient city has survived into the present day. Much of the royal and civic quarters sank beneath the harbour due to [[earthquake]] [[subsidence]] in AD 365, and the rest has been built over in modern times.
[[File:113KOM_EL_SHOQAFA_CATACOMBS.jpg|thumb|300px|Kom al-Shoqafa]]

"[[Pompey's Pillar (column)|Pompey's Pillar]]", a [[Roman triumphal column]], is one of the best-known [[ancient monument]]s still standing in Alexandria today. It is located on Alexandria's ancient [[acropolis]]—a modest hill located adjacent to the city's Arab [[cemetery]]—and was originally part of a temple colonnade. Including its [[pedestal]], it is 30&nbsp;m (99&nbsp;ft) high; the shaft is of polished red granite, {{convert|2.7|m|ft|1|abbr=on}}  in diameter at the base, tapering to {{convert|2.4|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} at the top. The shaft is {{convert|sp=us|88|ft|m}} high, and made out of a single piece of granite. Its volume is {{convert|132|sp=us|m3|0|abbr=off}} and weight approximately 396 tons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touregypt.net/featurestories/sarapeiona.htm |title=The Sarapeion, including Pompay's Pillar In Alexandria, Egypt |publisher=Touregypt.net |date=|accessdate=19 January 2009}}</ref><ref>[[Egyptian pyramids|The Pyramids]] and Sphinx by Desmond Stewart and editors of the Newsweek Book Division 1971 p. 80-81</ref> Pompey's Pillar may have been erected using the same methods that were used to erect the ancient [[obelisk]]s. [[Ancient Rome|The Romans]] had cranes but they were not strong enough to lift something this heavy. Roger Hopkins and Mark Lehrner conducted several [[Obelisks#Obelisk erecting experiments|obelisk erecting experiments]] including a successful attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk in 1999. This followed two experiments to erect smaller obelisks and two failed attempts to erect a 25-ton obelisk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=NOVA Online &#124; Mysteries of the Nile &#124; 27 August 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref><ref>[[Time–Life|Time Life]] Lost Civilizations series: Ramses II: Magnificence on the Nile (1993)p. 56-57</ref> The structure was plundered and demolished in the 4th century when a bishop decreed that Paganism must be eradicated. "Pompey's Pillar" is a [[misnomer]], as it has nothing to do with [[Pompey]], having been erected in 293 for [[Diocletian]], possibly in memory of the rebellion of [[Domitius Domitianus]]. Beneath the acropolis itself are the subterranean remains of the Serapeum, where the mysteries of the god [[Serapis]] were enacted, and whose carved wall niches are believed to have provided overflow storage space for the ancient Library. In more recent years, many ancient artifacts have been discovered from the surrounding sea, mostly pieces of old pottery.

Alexandria's [[catacombs]], known as ''[[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Kom al-Shoqafa]]'', are a short distance southwest of the pillar, consist of a multi-level labyrinth, reached via a large [[Stairway|spiral staircase]], and featuring dozens of chambers adorned with sculpted pillars, statues, and other [[syncretism|syncretic]] Romano-Egyptian [[Religious symbolism|religious symbols]], burial niches, and [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], as well as a large Roman-style banquet room, where memorial meals were conducted by relatives of the deceased. The catacombs were long forgotten by the citizens until they were discovered by accident in 1900.<ref>[http://www.lonelyplanet.com/egypt/mediterranean-coast/alexandria/sights/historic/catacombs-kom-ash-suqqafa Catacombs of Kom ash-Suqqafa – Lonely Planet<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The most extensive ancient excavation currently being conducted in Alexandria is known as ''Kom al-Dikka''. It has revealed the ancient city's well-preserved theater, and the remains of its [[Thermae|Roman-era baths]].

==Antiquities==
Persistent efforts have been made to explore the antiquities of Alexandria. Encouragement and help have been given by the local [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] Society, and by many individuals, notably Greeks proud of a city which is one of the glories of their national history. Excavations were performed in the city by Greeks seeking the tomb of Alexander the Great without success.
The past and present directors of the museum have been enabled from time to time to carry out systematic excavations whenever opportunity is offered; [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] made tentative researches on behalf of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] and the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies in 1895; and a German expedition worked for two years (1898–1899). But two difficulties face the would-be excavator in Alexandria: lack of space for excavation and the underwater location of some areas of interest.

Since the great and growing modern city stands immediately over the ancient one, it is almost impossible to find any considerable space in which to dig, except at enormous cost. [[Cleopatra VII]]'s royal quarters were inundated by earthquakes and tidal waves, leading to gradual [[subsidence]] in the 4th century AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |title=Fgs Project Alexandria |publisher=Underwaterdiscovery.org |date= |accessdate=14 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100307175057/http://www.underwaterdiscovery.org:80/Sitemap/Project/Alexandria/Default.aspx |archivedate=7 March 2010 }}</ref> This underwater section, containing many of the most interesting sections of the Hellenistic city, including the palace quarter, was explored in 1992 and is still being extensively investigated by the French underwater archaeologist [[Franck Goddio]] and his [[underwater archaeology|team]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/203470.stm |title=Divers probe underwater palace |publisher=BBC News |date=28 October 1998 |accessdate=19 January 2009}}</ref> It raised a noted head of [[Caesarion]]. These are being opened up to tourists, to some controversy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/940333.stm |title=New underwater tourist attraction in Egypt |publisher=BBC News |date=24 September 2000 |accessdate=19 January 2009}}</ref> The spaces that are most open are the low grounds to northeast and southwest, where it is practically impossible to get below the Roman [[stratum|strata]].

The most important results were those achieved by Dr. G. Botti, late director of the museum, in the neighborhood of “Pompey's Pillar”, where there is a good deal of open ground. Here, substructures of a large building or group of buildings have been exposed, which are perhaps part of the Serapeum. Nearby, immense [[catacombs]] and ''columbaria'' have been opened which may have been appendages of the temple. These contain one very remarkable vault with curious painted reliefs, now artificially lit and open to visitors.

The objects found in these researches are in the museum, the most notable being a great basalt bull, probably once an object of cult in the Serapeum. Other catacombs and tombs have been opened in [[Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa|Kom al-Shoqqafa]] (Roman) and Ras al-Tiin (painted).

The German excavation team found remains of a Ptolemaic colonnade and streets in the north-east of the city, but little else. Hogarth explored part of an immense brick structure under the mound of ''Kom al-Dikka'', which may have been part of the Paneum, the Mausolea, or a Roman fortress.

The making of the new foreshore led to the dredging up of remains of the Patriarchal Church; and the foundations of modern buildings are seldom laid without some objects of antiquity being discovered. The wealth underground is doubtlessly immense; but despite all efforts, there is not much for antiquarians to see in Alexandria outside the museum and the neighborhood of “Pompey's Pillar”.

===Temple of Taposiris Magna===
[[File:Magna Temple.jpg|thumb|right|upright|View of Abusir Pharaohs from the Temple of Taposiris Magna]]
The temple was built in the Ptolemy era and dedicated to Osiris, which finished the construction of Alexandria. It is located in Abusir, the western suburb of Alexandria in Borg el Arab city. Only the outer wall and the pylons remain from the temple. There is evidence to prove that sacred animals were worshiped there. Archaeologists found an animal necropolis near the temple. Remains of a Christian church show that the temple was used as a church in later centuries. Also found in the same area are remains of public baths built by the emperor Justinian, a seawall, quays and a bridge. Near the beach side of the area, there are the remains of a tower built by Ptolemy II Philadelphus. The tower was an exact scale replica of the destroyed Alexandrine [[Pharos Lighthouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/altapos.htm |title=Temple of Taposiris Magna near Abusir in Egypt |publisher=Touregypt.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-12}}</ref>

===Islam===
The most famous mosque in Alexandria is [[El-Mursi Abul Abbas Mosque]] in [[Bahary]]. Other notable mosques in the city include [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]] mosque in Somouha, [[Bilal ibn Ribah|Bilal]] mosque, al-Gamaa al-Bahari in Mandara, Hatem mosque in Somouha, Hoda el-Islam mosque in Sidi Bishr, al-Mowasah mosque in Hadara, Sharq al-Madina mosque in Miami, al-Shohadaa mosque in Mostafa Kamel, Al Qa'ed Ibrahim Mosque, Yehia mosque in Zizinia, Sidi Gaber mosque in Sidi Gaber, and Sultan mosque.

Alexandria is the base of the [[Salafi movement]]'s in Egypt. [[Al-Nour Party]], which is based in the city and overwhelmingly won most of the Salafi votes in the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011–12|2011–12 parliamentary election]], supports the president [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]].<ref name="FPAl"/>

===Christianity===
After [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]], Alexandria was considered the third-most important seat of [[Christianity]] in the world. The [[Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Pope of Alexandria]] was second only to the bishop of [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]], the capital of the [[Roman Empire]] until 430. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Church of Alexandria]] had jurisdiction over most of the continent of Africa. After the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in AD 451, the Church of Alexandria was split between the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysites]] and the [[Melkite]]s. The Miaphysites went on to constitute what is known today as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. The Melkites went on to constitute what is known today as the [[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria]]. In the 19th century, [[Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries converted some of the adherents of the Orthodox churches to their respective faiths.

Today, the Patriarchal seat of the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church is [[Saint Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral (Alexandria)|Saint Mark Cathedral]] in Ramleh. The most important Coptic Orthodox churches in Alexandria include [[Cyril of Alexandria|Pope Cyril I]] Church in Cleopatra, [[Saint George]]s Church in Sporting, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] & [[Pope Peter I of Alexandria|Pope Peter I]] Church in Sidi Bishr, [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Saint Mary]] Church in Assafra, Saint Mary Church in Gianaclis, [[Saint Menas|Saint Mina]] Church in Fleming, Saint Mina Church in Mandara and [[St. Takla Haymanot's Church (Alexandria)|Saint Takla Haymanot's Church]] in Ibrahimeya.

The most important [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches in Alexandria are [[Holy Unmercenaries|Agioi Anárgyroi]] Church, Church of the [[Annunciation]], [[Anthony of Padua|Saint Anthony]] Church, [[Gabriel|Archangels Gabriel]] & [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] Church, Taxiarchon Church, [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine]] Church, Cathedral of the [[Dormition of the Theotokos|Dormition]] in Mansheya, Church of the Dormition, [[Elijah|Prophet Elijah]] Church, [[Saint George]] Church, Church of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in Ibrahemeya, [[Saint Joseph]] Church in Fleming, [[Joseph of Arimathea|Saint Joseph of Arimathea]] Church, [[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]] & [[Nectarios of Aegina|Saint Nektarios]] Chapel in Ramleh, [[Saint Nicholas]] Church, [[Paraskevi of Rome|Saint Paraskevi]] Church, [[Saint Sava]] Cathedral in Ramleh, [[Theodore of Amasea|Saint Theodore]] Chapel and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] church of [[Alexander Nevsky|Saint Alexander Nevsky]] in Alexandria, which serves the Russian speaking community in the city.

The [[Apostolic Vicariate of Alexandria in Egypt-Heliopolis-Port Said]] has jurisdiction over all [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Egypt. Member churches include Saint Catherine Church in Mansheya and Church of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in Cleopatra. The city is also the nominal see of the Melkite Greek Catholic titular Patriarchate of Alexandria (generally vested in its leading Patriarch of Antioch) and the actual cathedral see of its [[Patriarchal territory of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan]], which uses the [[Byzantine Rite]], and the nominal see of the [[Armenian Catholic diocese of Iskandkeriya]] (for all Egypt and Sudan, whose actual cathedral is in Cairo), a suffragan of the [[Armenian Catholic Patriarch of Cilicia]], using the [[Armenian Rite]].

The Saint Mark Church in [[Shatby]], founded as part of [[Collège Saint Marc, Alexandria|Collège Saint Marc]], is multi-denominational and holds liturgies according to Latin Catholic, [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic Catholic]] and Coptic Orthodox rites.

In antiquity, Alexandria was a major center of the cosmopolitan religious movement called [[Gnosticism]] (today mainly remembered as a Christian heresy).

===Judaism===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Egypt}}
Alexandria's once-flourishing Jewish community declined rapidly following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], after which negative reactions towards [[Zionism]] among Egyptians led to Jewish residents in the city, and elsewhere in Egypt, being perceived as Zionist collaborators. Most Jewish residents of Egypt fled to the newly established [[Israel]], [[France]], [[Brazil]] and other countries in the 1950s and 1960s. The community once numbered 50,000 but is now estimated at below 50.<ref>[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue Egypt to restore Alexandria’s historic synagogue], (20 December 2010) {{wayback|url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2010/12/20/2742246/egypt-plans-to-restore-alexandrias-historic-synagogue |date=20101224165555 |df=y }}</ref> The most important [[synagogue]] in Alexandria is the [[Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue (Alexandria)|Eliyahu Hanavi Synagogue]].

===Colleges and universities===
Alexandria has a number of higher education institutions. [[Alexandria University]] is a public university that follows the Egyptian system of higher education. Many of its faculties are internationally renowned, most notably its [[Alexandria Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] & [[Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University|Faculty of Engineering]]. In addition, the [[Arab Academy for Science and Technology and Maritime Transport]] is a semi-private educational institution that offers courses for high school, undergraduate level, and postgraduate students. It is considered the most reputable university in Egypt after the AUC [[American University in Cairo]] because of its worldwide recognition from (board of engineers at UK & ABET in US). [[Senghor University|Université Senghor]] is a private French university that focuses on the teaching of humanities, politics and international relations, which mainly targets students from the African continent. Other institutions of higher education in Alexandria include [[Alexandria Higher Institute of Engineering and Technology|Alexandria Institute of Technology (AIT)]] and [[Pharos University in Alexandria]].

===Schools===
Alexandria has a long history of foreign educational institutions. The first foreign schools date to the early 19th century, when French missionaries began establishing French charitable schools to educate the Egyptians. Today, the most important French schools in Alexandria run by [[Catholic]] missionaries include [[Collège de la Mère de Dieu]], Collège Notre Dame de Sion, [[Collège Saint Marc, Alexandria|Collège Saint Marc]], Ecoles des Soeurs Franciscaines (four different schools), École Gérard, École Saint Gabriel, École Saint-Vincent de Paul, École saint joseph, École Sainte Catherine, and Institution Sainte Jeanne-Antide. As a reaction to the establishment of French religious institutions, a secular (laic) mission established Lycée el-Horreya, which initially followed a French system of education, but is currently a public school run by the Egyptian government. The only school in Alexandria that completely follows the French educational system is Lycée Français d'Alexandrie (École Champollion). It is usually frequented by the children of French expatriates and diplomats in Alexandria. The Italian school is the [[Istituto "Don Bosco"]].

English schools in Alexandria are becoming the most popular schools. The most important English language schools in the city include: Riada Language School (RLS) Also known as "Leadership Schools of Languages",Alexandria Language School(ALS), Future Language School(FLS), Future International Schools :(Future IGCSE, Future American School and future new German school), Alexandria American School, [[British School of Alexandria]], Egyptian American School, Pioneers Language School, Princesses Girls' School, Sidi Gaber Language Schools, Riada American school, Taymour English School (TES), Sacred Heart Girls' School (SHS), [[Schutz American School, Alexandria|Schutz American School]], [[Victoria College, Alexandria|Victoria College]], [[Manar English Girls School|El Manar Language School for Girls]], previously called (Scottish School for Girls), [[Kaumeya Language School]] (KLS), [[El Nasr Boys' School]] (EBS) Previously called (British Boys" School), and [[El Nasr Girls' College]] (EGC). Most of these schools were nationalized during the era of Nasser, and are currently Egyptian public schools run by the [[Egyptian Ministry of Education]].

There are only two German schools in Alexandria which are [[Deutsche Schule der Borromäerinnen Alexandria|Deutsche Schule der Borromärinnen]] (DSB of Saint Charles Borromé) and [[Future Deutsche Schule]].

The [[Montessori]] educational system was first introduced in Alexandria in 2009 at [[Alexandria Montessori]].

N.B: The most notable public schools in Alexandria include, AlAbasseia High School and Gamal Abdel Nasser High School.

===Airports===
Alexandria is served by [[Alexandria International Airport (Egypt)|Alexandria International Airport]] and [[Borg El Arab Airport|Borg al Arab Airport]] which is located about {{convert|sp=us|25|km|0|abbr=on}} away from city center.

From late 2011, Alexandria International was to be closed to commercial operations for two years as it underwent expansion, with all airlines operating out of Borg al Arab Airport from then onwards, where a brand new terminal was completed in February 2010.<ref>{{Cite news|title=A new gateway for Alexandria |newspaper=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/954/sk1.htm |postscript=<!--None--> |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904072239/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2009/954/sk1.htm |archivedate=4 September 2009 }}</ref>

===Highways===
*The International coastal road. (Alexandria – [[Port Said]])
*[[Cairo–Alexandria desert road|The Desert road]]. (Alexandria – Cairo /{{convert|220|km|sp=us|0|abbr=on}} 6–8 lanes, mostly lit)
*The Agricultural road. (Alexandria – Cairo)
*The Circular road. ''the turnpike''
*Ta'ameer Road "Mehwar El-Ta'ameer" – (Alexandria – North Coast)

===Rail===
Alexandria's intracity [[commuter rail]] system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity [[railway station]]) to [[Abu Qir]], parallel to the [[Alexandria Tram|tram line]]. The commuter line's [[locomotive]]s operate on [[diesel locomotive|diesel]], as opposed to the [[railway electrification system#Overhead systems|overhead-electric]] tram.

Alexandria plays host to two intercity railway stations: the aforementioned [[Misr Station]] (in the older Manshia district in the western part of the city) and [[Sidi Gaber railway station]] (in the district of Sidi Gaber in the center of the eastern expansion in which most Alexandrines reside), both of which also serve the commuter rail line. Intercity passenger service is operated by [[Egyptian National Railways]].

===Tram===
{{Main|Alexandria Tram}}
An extensive tramway network was built in 1860 and is the oldest in Africa. The tram network begins at Alraml district in the west and ends in the Victoria district in the east. Most of the vehicles are blue in color. Some smaller vehicles colored in yellow have further routes beyond the two main endpoints. The trams are given one of four numbers: 1, 2, 5, and 6. All the four start at Alraml, but only two (1 and 2) reach Victoria. On the length of the track there are two converging and diverging points. The first starts at Bolkly (Isis) and ends at San Stefano. The other begins at Sporting the Major and ends at Mostafa Kamel. Route 5 starts at San Stefano and takes the inner route to Bolkly. Route 6 starts at Sidi Gaber El Sheikh in the outer route between Sporting and Mostatfa Kamel. Route 1 takes the inner route between San Stefano and Bolkly and the outer route between Sporting and Mostafa Kamel. Route 2 takes the route opposite to Route 1 in both these areas. The tram fares are 25 piastres (0.25 pounds) during most of the day, and 50 piastres (0.50 pounds) after 9pm. Some trams (that date back the 30s) charge a pound. The Tram is considered the cheapest method of public transport.

===Buses===
Public buses are operated by Alexandria Governorate's Agency for Public Passenger Transport.

Blue public buses run the length of the Courniche. Fare (any distance) is 2 L.E. ([[Egyptian pound]]).

===Taxis and minibuses===
{{see also|Taxicabs by country#Egypt}}
Taxis in Alexandria sport a yellow-and-black [[livery]] and are widely available. While Egyptian law requires all cabs to carry [[taximeter|meters]], these generally do not work and fares must be negotiated with the driver on either departure or arrival.

The [[minibus]] [[share taxi]] system, or ''[[Share taxi#Mashrū`|mashrū`]]'' operates along well-known traffic arteries. The routes can be identified by both their endpoints and the route between them:
*Corniche routes:
**Mandara-Bahari
**Mandara-Manshia
**Assafra-Bahari
**Assafra-Manshia
**Al-Sa'aa-Manshia
*Abu Qir routes
**Mandara-El Mahata (i.e. Misr Station)
**Abu Qir-El Mahata
**Victoria-El Mahata
**Mandara-Victoria
*Interior routes
**Cabo-Bahari
**Manshia-El Awayid
**Manshia-Al Mouqif Al Gadid (the New Bus Station)
**Hadara-El Mahata

The route is generally written in Arabic on the side of the vehicle, although some drivers change their route without changing the paint. Some drivers also drive only a segment of a route rather than the whole path; such drivers generally stop at a point known as a major hub of the transportation system (for example, Victoria) to allow riders to transfer to another car or to another mode of transport.

Fare is generally L.E. 2.00 to travel the whole route. Shorter trips may have a lower fare, depending on the driver and the length of the trip.

===Port===
{{Main|Alexandria Port}}
Alexandria hosts Four harbors; namely the Western Harbor, which is the main harbor of the country that handles about 60% of the country’s exports and imports, El Dekhiela Harbor west of the Western Harbor, the Eastern Harbor which is a yachting harbor, and Abu Qir Harbor at the northern east of the governorate. It is commercial harbor for general cargo and phosphates.

===Libraries===
[[File:Bibliotheca Alexandrina plaza 003.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
[[File:AlexBibliothecaNight2.jpg|thumb|right|Library evening lights]]
[[File:Bibliotheca Alexandrina (panoramic view).jpg|thumb|Library of Alexandria|300px]]
{{main|Library of Alexandria}}
The Royal Library of Alexandria, in Alexandria, [[Egypt]], was once the largest library in the world. It is generally thought to have been founded at the beginning of the 3rd century BC, during the reign of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II of Egypt]]. It was likely created after his father had built what would become the first part of the library complex, the temple of the [[Muse]]s—the [[Musaeum|Museion]], Greek ''Μουσείον'' (from which the [[Modern English]] word ''[[Museum#Etymology|museum]]'' is derived).

It has been reasonably established that the library, or parts of the collection, were destroyed by fire on a number of occasions (library fires were common and replacement of handwritten manuscripts was very difficult, expensive, and time-consuming). To this day the details of the destruction (or destructions) remain a lively source of controversy.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] was inaugurated in 2003, near the site of the old Library.

===Literature===
[[File:Monument of the Navy Unknown Soldier in Alexandria (6).jpg|thumb|Monument of the Unknown Navy Soldier]]
Two writers loom large over the modern literature of Alexandria: the Alexandria-born Greek poet [[C.P. Cavafy]] and the Indian-born Briton [[Lawrence Durrell]], author of ''[[The Alexandria Quartet]]''. Cavafy incorporated Greek history, mythology, and his homosexuality into his poetry. Durrell used the cosmopolitan city as a landscape to explore human desires. Of Arabic novels set in Alexandria, [[Naguib Mahfouz]]'s ''[[Miramar (novel)|Miramar]]'' is the best known.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In the 2000s, writers such as [[Jon Courtenay Grimwood]], [[Ki Longfellow]], and Keith Miller have used Alexandria as a setting for [[speculative fiction]].
