{{Administrative divisions of France}}
In the [[administrative divisions of France]], the '''department''' ({{lang-fr|département}}, {{IPA-fr|depaʁt(ə)mɑ̃|pron}}) is one of the three levels of government below the national level ("[[Territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]]"), between the [[regions of France| 18 administrative regions]] and the [[Communes of France|commune]]. There are 96 departments in [[metropolitan France]] and 5 [[overseas department]]s, which also are classified as regions. Departments are further subdivided into 335 [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]], themselves divided into [[Cantons of France|cantons]]; the latter two have no autonomy and are used for the organisation of police, fire departments and sometimes elections.

Each department is administered by an elected body called a [[Departmental councils (France)|departmental council]] (''conseil départemental'' (sing.), ''conseils départementaux'' (plur.)). Before March 2015, they were called ''general councils'' (''conseil général'' (sing.), ''conseils généraux'' (plur.)).<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Presse/Dossiers-de-presse/Dossier-de-presse-des-elections-departementales-2015/Les-elections-departementales-comprendre-ce-qui-change |title=Les élections départementales : comprendre ce qui change|author=Ministère de l'intérieur|accessdate=2015-07-30|language=fr}}</ref> Each council has a president. Their main areas of responsibility include the management of a number of social and welfare allowances, of [[Secondary education in France#Collège|junior high school (''collège'')]] buildings and technical staff, of local roads and school and rural buses, and a contribution to municipal infrastructures. Local services of the State administration are traditionally organised at departmental level, where the [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] represents the government; however, regions have gained importance in this regard since the 2000s, with some department-level services merged into region-level services.

The departments were created in 1791 as a rational replacement of [[Ancien Régime]] [[Provinces of France|provinces]] in view of strengthening national unity; the title "department" is used to mean a part of a larger whole. Almost all of them were therefore named after rivers, mountains or coasts rather than after historical or cultural territories which could have their own loyalties. The division of France into departments was a project particularly identified with the French revolutionary leader the [[Abbé Sieyès]], although it had already been frequently discussed and written about by many politicians and thinkers. The earliest known suggestion of it is from 1764 in the writings of [[René Louis de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson|d'Argenson]]. They have inspired similar divisions in many countries, some of them former French colonies.

Most French departments are assigned a two-digit number, the "Official Geographical Code", allocated by the ''Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques.'' Some overseas departments have a three-digit number. The number is used, for example, in [[Postal codes in France|postal code]] and was until recently used for all [[Vehicle registration plates of France|vehicle registration plates]]. While it is common for residents to use the numbers to refer to their own department or a neighbouring one, more distant departments are generally referred to by their names, as few people know the numbers of all the departments. For example, inhabitants of [[Loiret]] might refer to their department as "the 45".

In 2014, President [[François Hollande]] proposed to abolish departmental councils by 2020, which would maintain the departments as administrative divisions, but transfer their powers to other levels of governance. This reform project has since been abandoned.

==History==
{{Main|Territorial formation of France}}
[[File:ChassisFiguratif.jpg|thumb|Geometrical proposition rejected]]
[[File:Départements et provinces de France.png|thumb|The [[Provinces of France|former provinces]] (colours) and the departements (limits in black)]]
The first French territorial departments were proposed in 1665 by Marc-René d'Argenson to serve as administrative areas purely for the [[Ponts et Chaussées]] (Bridges and Highways) infrastructure administration.

Before the [[French Revolution]], France gained territory gradually through the annexation of a mosaic of independent entities. By the close of the [[Ancien Régime]], it was organised into [[Provinces of France|provinces]]. During the period of the Revolution, these were dissolved, partly in order to weaken old loyalties.

The modern departments, as all-purpose units of the government, were created on 4 March 1790 by the [[National Constituent Assembly]] to replace the provinces with what the Assembly deemed a more rational structure. Their boundaries served two purposes:
* Boundaries were deliberately chosen to break up France's historical regions in an attempt to erase cultural differences and build a more homogeneous nation.
* Boundaries were set so that any settlement in the country was within a day's ride of the capital of the department. This was a security measure, intended to keep the entire national territory under close control. This measure was directly inspired by the [[Reign of Terror|Great Terror]], during which the government had lost control of many rural areas far from any centre of government.
[[File:France L-2 (1812)-fr.svg|thumb|Departments at the maximum extent of the [[First French Empire]] (1812)]]

The old nomenclature was carefully avoided in naming the new departments. Most were named after an area's principal river or other physical features. Even Paris was in the department of [[Seine (department)|Seine]].

The number of departments, initially 83, was increased to [[130 departments of the First French Empire|130]] by 1809 with the territorial gains of the Republic and of the [[First French Empire]] (see [[Provinces of the Netherlands]] for the annexed Dutch departments). Following [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s defeats in 1814-1815, the [[Congress of Vienna]] returned France to its pre-war size; the number of departments was reduced to 86, as three of the original departments had been split. In 1860, France acquired the [[County of Nice]] and [[Savoy]], which led to the creation of three new departments. Two were added from the new Savoyard territory, while the department of ''[[Alpes-Maritimes]]'' was created from Nice and a portion of the ''[[Var (department)|Var]]'' department. The 89 departments were given numbers based on their alphabetical order.

The department of ''[[Bas-Rhin]]'' and parts of ''[[Meurthe (department)|Meurthe]],'' ''[[Moselle (department)|Moselle]],'' ''[[Vosges (department)|Vosges]]'' and ''[[Haut-Rhin]]'' were ceded to the [[German Empire]] in 1871, following France's defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. A small part of ''Haut-Rhin'' remained French, however, and became known as the ''[[Territoire de Belfort]]'', and the remaining parts of ''Meurthe'' and ''Moselle'' were merged into a new ''[[Meurthe-et-Moselle]]'' department. When France regained the ceded departments after [[World War I]], the ''Territoire de Belfort'' was not reintegrated into Haut-Rhin. In 1922, it became France's 90th department. Likewise, the Lorraine departments were not changed back to their original limits, and a new ''Moselle'' department was created on the regained territory, with slightly different limits than the pre-war department of the same name.

The reorganisation of Île-de-France (1968) and the division of [[Corsica]] (1975) added six more departments, raising the total to 96. Counting the five [[overseas department]]s ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Réunion]] and [[Mayotte]]) the total comes to 101 departments. In 2011, the [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Mayotte]] became the 101st department.

The departmental seat of government is known as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] (''préfecture'') or ''chef-lieu de département'' and is generally a city of some importance roughly at the geographical centre of the department. This was determined according to the time taken to travel on horseback from the periphery of the department. The goal was for the prefecture to be accessible by horseback from any town in the department within 24 hours. The prefecture is not necessarily the largest city in the department; for instance, in [[Saône-et-Loire]] department the capital is [[Mâcon]], but the largest city is [[Chalon-sur-Saône]]. Departments are divided into one or more [[arrondissements of France|arrondissements]]. The capital of an arrondissement is called a [[Subprefectures in France|subprefecture]] (''sous-préfecture'') or ''chef-lieu d'arrondissement''.

Each department is administered by a [[Departmental councils (France)|departmental council]] (''conseil départemental''), an assembly elected for six years by [[universal suffrage]], with the president of the council as executive of the department. Before 1982, the executive of a department was the [[Prefect (France)|prefect]] (''préfet'') who represents the [[Cabinet of France|Government of France]] in each department and is appointed by the [[President of France]]. The prefect is assisted by one or more sub-prefects (''sous-préfet'') based in the subprefectures of the department.

The departments are further divided into [[Communes of France|communes]], governed by [[Municipality|municipal councils]]. As of 2013, there were 36,681 communes in France. In the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territories]], some communes play a role at departmental level. [[Paris]], the country’s capital city, is a commune as well as a department.

In continental France ([[metropolitan France]], excluding [[Corsica]]), the [[median]] land area of a department is {{convert|5965|km2|abbr=on}}, which is two-and-a-half times the median land area of a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county of England]] & [[Preserved counties of Wales|Wales]] and slightly more than three-and-half times the median land area of a [[County (United States)|county of the United States]]. At the 2001 census, the median population of a department in continental France was 511,012 inhabitants, which is 21 times the median population of a U.S. county, but less than two-thirds of the median population of a ceremonial county of England & Wales. Most of the departments have an area of between 4,000 and 8,000&nbsp;km², and a population between 320,000 and 1 million. The largest in area is [[Gironde]] (10,000&nbsp;km²), while the smallest is the city of Paris (105&nbsp;km²). The most populous is [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] (2,550,000) and the least populous is [[Lozère]] (74,000).

The departments are numbered: their two-digit numbers appear in [[postal code]]s, in [[INSEE]] codes (including "social security numbers") and on [[Vehicle registration plates of France|vehicle number-plates]]. Initially, the numbers corresponded to the alphabetical order of the names of the departments, but several changed their names, so the correspondence became less exact. There is no number 20, but 2A and 2B instead, for [[Corsica]]. Corsican postal codes or addresses in both departments do still start with 20, though. The two-digit code "98" is used by [[Monaco]]. Together with the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code FR, the numbers form the [[ISO 3166-2]] country subdivision codes for the metropolitan departments. The overseas departments get three digits—e.g., 971 for Guadeloupe (see table below).

Originally, the relationship between the departments and the central government was left somewhat ambiguous.  While citizens of each department elected their own officials, the local governments were subordinated to the central government, becoming instruments of national integration.  By 1793, however, the revolutionary government had turned the departments into transmission belts for policies enacted in Paris.  With few exceptions, the departments had this role until the early 1960s.

===Party-political preferences===
These maps cannot be used as a useful resource of voter preferences, because Departmental Councils are elected on a two-round system, which drastically limits the chances of fringe parties, for as long as they are not supported on one of the two rounds by a moderate party. After the 1992 election, the left had a majority in only 21 of the 100 departments; after the 2011 election, the left dominated 61 of the 100 departments (Mayotte only became a department after the election).

Key to the parties:
* [[Centrism|Divers Centre]] = Independents of the Centre or [[Democratic Movement (France)|Democratic Movement]] (Mouvement démocrate)
* Divers Droite (DVD) = Independent conservatives
* Divers Gauche (DVG) = [[Miscellaneous Left|Independent left-wing politicians]]
* MPF = [[Movement for France]] (Mouvement pour la France) (right)
* Nouveau Centre = [[New Centre]] (centre or centre-right)
* PCF = [[French Communist Party]] (Parti Communiste Français)
* PRG = [[Radical Party of the Left]] (Parti Radical de Gauche)
* PS = [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (Parti Socialiste)
* UDF = [[Union for French Democracy]] (Union pour la Démocratie Française) succeeded by Democratic Movement
* UMP = [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (Union pour un Mouvement Populaire)

==Future==
The removal of one or more levels of local government has been discussed for some years; in particular, the option of removing the departmental level. [[Frédéric Lefebvre]], spokesman for the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]], said in December 2008 that the fusion of the departments with the regions was a matter to be dealt with soon. This was soon refuted by [[Édouard Balladur]] and [[Gérard Longuet]], members of the Committee for the reform of local authorities, known as the Balladur Committee.<ref name="Lexpress">{{cite web | url=http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/politique/la-fusion-departement-region-n-est-pas-a-l-ordre-du-jour_728648.html | title=La fusion département-région n'est pas à l'ordre du jour | publisher=L'Express | accessdate=2011-07-21}}</ref>

In January 2008, the Commission for freeing French development, known as the [[Jacques Attali#"Attali Commission"|Attali Commission]], recommended that the departmental level of government should be eliminated within ten years.<ref>This is stated in the title of the section dealing with "Decision 260" on page 197 of the [http://www.la-croix.com/illustrations/Multimedia/Actu/2008/1/23/attali.pdf Report of the ''Attali Commission''] {{fr icon}}</ref>

Nevertheless, the Balladur Committee has not retained this proposition and does not advocate the disappearance of the departments, but simply "favors the voluntary grouping of departments," which it suggests also for the regions, with the aim of bringing the number of the latter down to fifteen.<ref name="Balladur">{{cite web|url=http://reformedescollectiviteslocales.fr/actualites/index.php?id=75|title=Les 20 propositions du Comité (20 propositions of the Committee)|publisher=Committee for the reform of local authorities|language=French|accessdate=2009-11-11}}</ref> This committee advocates, on the contrary, the suppression of the cantons.<ref name="Balladur"/>

Notes for Table 7:
# Where a Napoleonic department was composed of parts from more than one country, the nation-state containing the prefecture is listed. Please expand this table to list all countries containing significant parts of the department.
# Territories that were a part of [[Southern Netherlands|Austrian Netherlands]] were also a part of [[Holy Roman Empire]].
# The [[Bishopric of Basel]] was a German [[Prince-Bishop]]ric, not to be confused with the adjacent [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] [[Basel (canton)|Canton of Basel]].
# The territories of the Republic of Venice were lost to France, becoming the [[Septinsular Republic]], a nominal vassal of the Ottoman Empire, from 1800–07. After reverting to France at the [[Treaty of Tilsit]], these territories then became a [[Great Britain|British]] protectorate, as the [[United States of the Ionian Islands]]
# [[Maastricht]] was a [[condominium (international law)|condominium]] of the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Bishopric of Liège]].
# On 6 June 1805, as a result of the annexation of the [[Ligurian Republic]] (the [[puppet state|puppet]] [[successor state]] to the [[Republic of Genoa]]), [[Tanaro (department)|Tanaro]] was abolished and its territory divided between the departments of [[Marengo (department)|Marengo]], [[Montenotte Department|Montenotte]] and [[Stura]].
# Before becoming the department of [[Apennins]], the [[Republic of Genoa]] was converted to a [[puppet state|puppet]] [[successor state]], the [[Ligurian Republic]].
# Before becoming the department of [[Arno (department)|Arno]], the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] was converted to a [[puppet state|puppet]] [[successor state]], the [[Kingdom of Etruria]].
# [[Rome (department)|Rome]] was known as the ''{{lang|fr|department du Tibre}}'' until 1810.
# Before becoming the departments of [[Bouches-du-Rhin]], [[Bouches-de-l'Escaut]], [[Bouches-de-la-Meuse]], [[Bouches-de-l'Yssel]], [[Ems-Occidental]], [[Frise (department)|Frise]], [[Yssel-Supérieur]] and [[Zuyderzée]], these territories of the [[Dutch Republic]] were converted to a [[puppet state|puppet]] [[successor state]], the [[Batavian Republic]] (1795–1806), then those territories that had not already been annexed (all except the first two departments here), along with the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[East Frisia|County of East Frisia]], were converted to another puppet state, the [[Kingdom of Holland]].
# Before becoming the department of [[Simplon (department)|Simplon]], the [[Valais|République des Sept Dizains]] was converted to a revolutionary République du Valais (16 March 1798) which was swiftly incorporated (1 May 1798) into the [[puppet state|puppet]] [[Helvetic Republic]] until 1802 when it became the independent Rhodanic Republic.
# In the months before [[Lippe (department)|Lippe]] was formed, the ''[[arrondissements]]'' of [[Rees, Germany|Rees]] and [[Münster]] were part of [[Yssel-Supérieur]], the ''arrondissement'' of [[Steinfurt]] was part of [[Bouches-de-l'Yssel]] and the ''arrondissement'' of [[Neuenhaus]] was part of [[Ems-Occidental]].
