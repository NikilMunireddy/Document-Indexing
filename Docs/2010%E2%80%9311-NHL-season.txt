The '''2010–11 NHL season''' was the [[List of NHL seasons|94th]] season of operation (93rd [[Season (sport)|season]] of play) of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). The [[Boston Bruins]] defeated the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in the [[2011 Stanley Cup Final|Stanley Cup Final]] 4–3 to win the Stanley Cup. It was the sixth Cup win in Bruins' franchise history. For the fourth consecutive season, the season started with games in Europe. The [[58th National Hockey League All-Star Game|58th All-Star Game]] was held at the [[RBC Center]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], home arena of the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], on January 30, 2011.

This was the final season of operation for the [[Atlanta Thrashers]], who were sold to True North Sports and Entertainment out of [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba, and moved from Atlanta to Winnipeg to become the [[Winnipeg Jets]]. Winnipeg previously had lost its NHL team, also called the [[Winnipeg Jets (1972-96)|Winnipeg Jets]], after the [[1995–96 NHL season]] to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], Arizona, and were renamed "[[Phoenix Coyotes]]." This was the second time the city of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], had lost an NHL franchise, previously losing the [[Atlanta Flames]] to [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], after the [[1979–80 NHL season|1979–80 season]].

==League business==

===US television deals===
The league's broadcast agreements with [[NHL on NBC|NBC]] and [[NHL on Versus|Versus]], which were to expire at the end of the season were renewed. On April 19, NBC/Versus and the NHL agreed to a new ten-year deal worth a total US$2 billion.<ref name=NBCVSTVDEAL>{{cite news |last=Pucin |first=Diane |title=NHL signs on with NBC/Versus for 10 more years |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/sports_blog/2011/04/nhl-versus-nbc-hockey-television-contract.html|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 29, 2011 |date=April 19, 2011}}</ref>

===New arena===
The [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] moved to the newly constructed [[Consol Energy Center]]. The arena replaced [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Mellon Arena]], also known as "The Igloo," where the Penguins had played since their inception in {{NHL Year|1967|start}}. The new arena has a seating capacity of 18,387, and was officially inaugurated with the continuation of the [[Flyers–Penguins rivalry|"Battle of the Keystone State"]] between the Penguins and their fellow [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] rivals and defending [[Prince of Wales Trophy|Eastern Conference champion]], the [[Philadelphia Flyers]], on October 7 as part of the NHL's Opening Face-Off. The Flyers defeated Pittsburgh 3–2 in the Penguins' debut in the Consol Energy Center.

Two existing arenas received a new name starting with the 2010–11 season. The [[Vancouver Canucks]]' home, previously known as General Motors Place, became [[Rogers Arena]] after the [[Rogers Communications|Canadian telecommunications company]] purchased the naming rights from [[General Motors Canada]]. The [[Calgary Flames]]' home arena name was also changed from the Pengrowth Saddledome to the [[Scotiabank Saddledome]] after the [[Scotiabank|Canadian banking company]].

===Salary cap===
On June 23, 2010, the NHL announced that the [[salary cap]] would be increased by $2.6 million. As a result, the new salary cap ceiling is set at $59.4 million, while the salary cap floor is $43.4 million.<ref>{{cite web|title=NHL salary cap set at $59.4 million for 2010–11 season|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/story/?id=325481|publisher=The Sports Network|author=TSN|date=June 23, 2010}}</ref>

===Entry draft===
{{Main|2010 NHL Entry Draft}}
The [[2010 NHL Entry Draft]] took place on June 25–26, 2010, at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], home arena of the [[Los Angeles Kings]]. [[Taylor Hall]] was selected first overall in the draft by the [[Edmonton Oilers]], [[Tyler Seguin]] was picked second by the [[Boston Bruins]] and [[Erik Gudbranson]] was chosen third by the [[Florida Panthers]].

===Franchise sales===
[[Tom Golisano]], [[Larry Quinn (ice hockey)|Larry Quinn]] and Daniel DiPofi, owners of the [[Buffalo Sabres]], sold their franchise to [[Terrence Pegula]] during the course of the 2010–11 season. The league approved the sale February 18, 2011.

===Uniform changes===
Several teams announced plans to change their uniforms in the 2010–11 season.<ref>[http://www.icethetics.info/blog/2010/5/2/nhl-jerseywatch-2010.html NHL Jersey Watch 2010], Icetherics.info, May 2, 2010.</ref>

The [[Buffalo Sabres]], as part of their 40th anniversary season, reverted to the classic crossed swords insignia (replacing the infamous "Buffaslug" logo) and a slightly updated uniform based upon the style they wore from 1970 through 1996, when they left [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]] and moved down the street to the [[HSBC Arena (Buffalo)|HSBC Arena]] with blue and gold trim. The blue version was previously their third jersey for the past three seasons. A new third jersey, also in blue, featured the city's name in white script on the chest, along with "quilted" numbers on the back and a gold nameplate with blue lettering fashioning the look of the AHL's former [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Buffalo Bisons]].

The [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] unveiled a third jersey November 24<ref>[http://bluejackets.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=542675], bluejackets.com, November 5, 2010.</ref> as part of their 10th season celebration. The new {{Not a typo|jersey}} made its debut on November 26 when the Blue Jackets hosted the [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>[http://bluejackets.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=48158], bluejackets.com, September 30, 2010.</ref>

The [[Philadelphia Flyers]] adopted their [[2010 NHL Winter Classic]] white uniforms as their new road uniform and dropped the black third jersey they wore since changing to [[Reebok]]'s "NHL Edge" template.

The [[New York Islanders]] reverted to the uniforms they made their debut back in 1972–73; their royal blue uniforms were their third jersey for the past two seasons. The road white uniforms are also from the 1972–73 season.

The [[New York Rangers]] inaugurated a new third jersey. The jersey resembled the one worn by the team in its early years, notably during their Stanley Cup championship years of [[1927–28 New York Rangers season|1928]] and [[1932–33 New York Rangers season|1933]], but with "NEW YORK" across the jersey, instead of "RANGERS."

The [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] unveiled new home and road jerseys on June 14, 2010, seeing the return of the horizontal stripes on the bottom of the jersey and the "veined leaf" logo on both shoulders. The jersey also includes a white collar with string lace-up instead of a V-shaped collar.<ref>[http://mapleleafs.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=531644 Leafs Unveil New Uniforms], MapleLeafs.com, June 14, 2010.</ref>

In third jersey items, the [[Calgary Flames]] used the third jerseys they debuted in the 2009–10 season onto the Edge template in a retro style from the [[1988–89 NHL season|1988–89 season]]. After a three-year hiatus, the [[Anaheim Ducks]] unveiled a new third jersey on November 26 against the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].  The [[Los Angeles Kings]] added a throwback purple and gold uniform, with [[:File:Los Angeles Kings Crown Logo.svg|the original 1967 style]] of purple, gold and white crown graphic on the jersey front for up to four games, and the [[Dallas Stars]] swapped designations on their two white jerseys. The [[Vancouver Canucks]], like the Sabres, were celebrating their 40th anniversary and wore replicas of their original 1970–71 white jerseys for several home games as well. Despite the league rules stating that all team jerseys must have nameplates on the back, both the Canucks and Kings were granted permission to wear jerseys without nameplates. The Washington Capitals, the road team in the 2011 Winter Classic, wore their Winter Classic jerseys in a home game vs. the Montreal Canadians in honor of former Capital [[Dino Ciccarelli]] and his 2010 induction to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]].

==Rule changes==

===Tie-breaking procedure===
Prior to the 2010–11 season, the first tie-breaker to separate teams with equal number of points in a conference was the number of games won, no matter how the wins were obtained. For the 2010–11 season, the league made a modification to this rule. The new rule states that the team with the greater number of games won, excluding wins obtained in the shootout, will be ranked higher. The change was made to reward in-play team victories (regulation or overtime) instead of a win obtained via an individual skill contest. This figure will be tracked in an additional column in the [[League table|official league standings]] called ''ROW (Regulation and overtime wins)''. In its first year, the tie-breaker would prove critical, giving the 106-point, 47-win (44-ROW) [[Philadelphia Flyers]] the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division]] title over the 106-point, 49-win (39-ROW) [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], who were seeded fourth rather than second based on the new rule.

===Illegal hits to the head===
Prior to the 2010–11 season, the Board of Governors, General Managers and the Competition Committee unanimously agreed to implement a new penalty. An illegal hit to the head is a lateral or blind side hit to an opponent where the head is targeted and/or is the principal point of contact is not permitted. Any player who incurs a total of two game misconducts under this rule shall be suspended automatically for the next game his team plays. For each subsequent game misconduct penalty, the automatic suspension shall be increased by one game. The commissioner of the league can increase the suspension longer due to his discretion.

==Pre-season==

===2010 Kraft Hockeyville===
Every year since 2006, [[Kraft Foods]] has sponsored a contest called [[Kraft Hockeyville]], where small Canadian towns compete against each other for the title of Hockeyville. The winning town also gets to host an NHL preseason game in a local arena, as well as hosting an event called the 'Stanley Cup Jamboree'. [[Dundas, Ontario]], a suburb of [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] (which itself has been the subject of numerous efforts at [[potential National Hockey League expansion]]) won the 2010 contest, and hosted the pre-season game between the [[Ottawa Senators]] and the [[Buffalo Sabres]] on September 28, 2010.

===European exhibition games===
{{See also|List of international games played by NHL teams|List of KHL vs NHL games}}
The six teams going to Europe to open their regular seasons there as part of the NHL Premiere games also played exhibition games against European teams under the banner of NHL Premiere Challenge to close out their pre-seasons, finishing with a 6–1–0 record.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khlnhl.ru/en/ |title=Exhibition game KHL – NHL |publisher=[[Kontinental Hockey League]] |accessdate=July 26, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100729032920/http://www.khlnhl.ru/en/| archivedate= July 29, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="nhl-special-event-announce"/><ref>http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=530443</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/schedulebymonth.htm?month=201010 |title=NHL Hockey Schedule for October 2010 – NHL.com – Schedule |publisher=[[National Hockey League]] |accessdate=July 30, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100723105656/http://www.nhl.com/ice/schedulebymonth.htm?month=201010| archivedate= July 23, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

{{Main|2011 Stanley Cup playoffs}}
The 2011 playoffs started on Wednesday, April 13, 2011, and ended with the seventh game of the Stanley Cup Final on Wednesday, June 15, 2011.<ref name="nhl-special-event-announce"/><ref>[http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=532296 NHL Announces 2010–11 Regular Season Schedule], ''nhl.com'', June 22, 2010.</ref> The Boston Bruins won three game sevens including a rare game seven in the Finals to win against the Vancouver Canucks and win the franchise's sixth Stanley Cup. The game seven victory in the final was the Bruins' first ever game seven victory on the road. The Bruins also swept the Philadelphia Flyers in the second round to avenge their loss to the Flyers in the 2010 playoffs, when the Bruins held a three games to none lead (including a 3-0 lead in game 7), and lost the series.

===Playoff bracket===
In each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Final series, home ice is determined based on regular season points. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team plays at home for games one and two (plus five and seven if necessary), and the lower-seeded team is at home for games three and four (and if necessary, game six).
