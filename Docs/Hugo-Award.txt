The '''Hugo Awards''' are a set of awards given annually for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The awards are named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], the founder of the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', and were officially named the Science Fiction Achievement Awards until 1992. Organized and overseen by the [[World Science Fiction Society]], the awards are given each year at the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]] as the central focus of the event. They were first given in 1953, at the [[11th World Science Fiction Convention]], and have been awarded every year since 1955. Over the years that the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently Hugo Awards are given in more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works of various types.

One of the most prestigious science fiction awards, the Hugo Awards have been termed as "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing".<ref name="LAT"/> Works that have won have been published in special collections, and the official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool. The 2015 awards were presented at the [[73rd World Science Fiction Convention|73rd Worldcon]], Sasquan, in [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]], United States, on August 22, 2015. The 2016 Hugos will be presented at the [[74th World Science Fiction Convention|74th Worldcon]], MidAmeriCon II, in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], United States, on August 21, 2016.

For lists of winners and nominees for each category, see the [[#Categories|list of award categories]] below.

The World Science Fiction Society (WSFS) gives out the Hugo Awards each year for the best [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] works and achievements of the previous year. The award is named after [[Hugo Gernsback]], who founded the pioneering science fiction magazine ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' and who is considered one of the "fathers" of the science fiction genre.<ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/> Works are eligible for an award if they were published in English in the prior calendar year. There are no written rules as to which works qualify as science fiction or fantasy, and the decision of eligibility in that regard is left up to the voters, rather than to the organizing committee. Hugo Award nominees and winners are chosen by supporting or attending members of the annual [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], or Worldcon, and the presentation evening constitutes its central event. The selection process is defined in the WSFS constitution as [[instant-runoff voting]] with five nominees per category, except in the case of a tie.<ref name="thafaq"/> The awards are split over more than a dozen categories, and include both written and dramatic works.<ref name="thacat"/>

For each category of Hugo, the voter may rank "No Award" as one of their choices. Voters are instructed that they should do so if they feel that none of the nominees are worthy of the award, or if they feel the category should be abolished entirely. A vote for "No Award" other than as one's first choice signifies that the voter believes the nominee(s) ranked higher than "No Award" are worthy of a Hugo in that category, while those ranked lower are not.<ref name="thavoting"/>

The five works on the ballot for each category are the most-nominated by members that year, with no limit on the number of stories that can be nominated. From 1953 to 1958 the awards did not include any recognition of runner-up novels, but since 1959 all of the candidates have been recorded.<ref name="thafaq"/> Initial nominations are made by members in January through March, while voting on the ballot of five nominations is performed roughly in April through July, subject to change depending on when that year's Worldcon is held.<ref name="thaabout"/> Worldcons are generally held near the start of September, and take place in a different city around the world each year.<ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/><ref name="worldcon"/>

The idea of giving out awards at Worldcons was proposed by Harold Lynch for the 1953 convention.<ref name="HugoPropose"/> The idea was based on the [[Academy Award]]s,<ref name="Nicholls595"/> with the name "Hugo" being given by Robert A. Madle. The award itself was created by Jack McKnight and [[Benedict Jablonski|Ben Jason]] in 1953, based on the design of hood ornaments of 1950s cars. It consisted of a finned rocket ship on a wooden base. Each subsequent award, with the exception of the 1958 award, has been similar to the original design. The rocket trophy was formally redesigned in 1984, and since then only the base of the trophy has changed each year.<ref name="HugoTrophy"/> There is no monetary or other remuneration associated with the Hugo, other than the trophy.<ref name="thafaq"/>

===Retro Hugos===
Retrospective Hugo Awards, or Retro Hugos, were added in the mid-1990s. These awards are given by Worldcons held 50, 75, or 100 years after a Worldcon where no Hugos had been awarded, which were the conventions in 1939–41, 1946–52, and 1954, and are given for works that would have been eligible in that year, by the same process as the regular Hugos.<ref name="thafaq"/> Retro Hugos have only been given five times: in 1996, 2001, and 2004 for 50 years prior, and 2014 and 2016 for 75 years prior. The six Worldcons eligible in 1997–2000, 2002, and 2015 chose not to award them. The next opportunity will be in 2022 for 1947.<ref name="LocusRetroHugoinfo"/>

==History==

===1950s===
The first Hugo Awards were presented at the [[11th World Science Fiction Convention|11th Worldcon]] in Philadelphia in 1953, which awarded Hugos in seven categories.<ref name="Hugo53"/> The awards presented that year were initially conceived as a one-off event, though the organizers hoped that subsequent conventions would also present them.<ref name="PhilconBook"/> At the time, Worldcons were completely run by their respective committees as independent events and had no oversight between years. Thus there was no mandate for any future conventions to repeat the awards, and no set rules for how to do so.<ref name="Hugo54"/>

The 1954 Worldcon chose not to, but the awards were reinstated at the 1955 Worldcon, and thereafter became traditional. The award was called the Annual Science Fiction Achievement Award, with "Hugo Award" being an unofficial, but better known name.<ref name="LocusHugoinfo"/> The nickname was accepted as an official alternative name in 1958, and since the 1992 awards the nickname has been adopted as the official name of the award.<ref name="Nicholls595"/><ref name="91minutes"/>

In 1959, though there were still no formal guidelines governing the awards, several rules were instated which thereafter became traditional. These included having a ballot for nominating works earlier in the year and separate from the voting ballot; defining eligibility to include works published in the prior calendar year, rather than the previous rule of the "preceding year"; and allowing voters to select "no award" as an option, which then won that year in two categories: [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation|Dramatic Presentation]] and [[Discontinued Hugo Awards|Best New Author]].<ref name="Hugo59"/> The eligibility change additionally sparked a separate rule, prohibiting the nomination of works which had been nominated for the 1958 awards, as the two time periods overlapped.<ref name="Franson36"/>

===1960s===
In 1961, after the formation of the WSFS to oversee each Worldcon committee, formal rules were set down in the WSFS constitution mandating the presenting of the awards as one of the responsibilities of each Worldcon organizing committee. The rules restricted voting to members of the convention that the awards would be given at, while still allowing anyone to nominate works; nominations were restricted to members of the convention or the previous year's convention in 1963.<ref name="Franson36"/> The guidelines also specified the categories that would be awarded, which could only be changed by the World Science Fiction Society board.<ref name="63minutes"/> These categories were for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]], [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story|Short Fiction]] (short stories, broadly defined), Dramatic Presentation, [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Magazine|Professional Magazine]], [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist|Professional Artist]], and [[Hugo Award for Best Fanzine|Best Fanzine]] (fan magazine).<ref name="Hugo61"/> 1963 was also the second year in which "no award" won a category, again for Dramatic Presentation.<ref name="Hugo63"/>

In 1964 the guidelines were changed to allow individual conventions to create additional categories, which was codified as up to two categories for that year. These [[Discontinued Hugo Awards|additional awards]] were officially designated as Hugo Awards, but were not required to be repeated by future conventions.<ref name="63const"/> This was later adjusted to only allow one additional category; while these extra Hugo Awards have been given out in several categories, only a few were ever awarded for more than one year.<ref name="thacat"/>

In 1967 categories for [[Hugo Award for Best Novelette|Novelette]], [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer|Fan Writer]], and [[Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist|Fan Artist]] were added, and a category for [[Hugo Award for Best Novella|Best Novella]] was added the following year; these new categories had the effect of providing a definition for what word count qualified a work for what category, which was previously left up to voters.<ref name="Hugo67"/><ref name="Hugo68"/> Novelettes had also been awarded prior to the codification of the rules. The fan awards were initially conceived as separate from the Hugo Awards, with the award for Best Fanzine losing its status, but were instead absorbed into the regular Hugo Awards by the convention committee.<ref name="Franson36"/>

===1970s===
While traditionally five works had been selected for nomination in each category out of the proposed nominees, in 1971 this was set down as a formal rule, barring ties.<ref name="Franson36"/> In 1973, the WSFS removed the category for Best Professional Magazine, and a [[Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor|Best Professional Editor]] award was instated as its replacement, in order to recognize "the increasing importance of original anthologies".<ref name="Hugo73"/><ref name="Nicholls596"/>

After that year the guidelines were changed again to remove the mandated awards and instead allow up to ten categories which would be chosen by each convention, though they were expected to be similar to those presented in the year before. Despite this change no new awards were added or previous awards removed before the guidelines were changed back to listing specific categories in 1977.<ref name="Franson36"/><ref name="74minutes"/> 1971 and 1977 both saw "no award" win the Dramatic Presentation category for the third and fourth time; "no award" did not win any categories afterwards until 2015.<ref name="Hugo71"/><ref name="Hugo77"/>

===1980s and 90s===
In 1980 the category for Best Non-Fiction Book (later renamed [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work|Best Related Work]]) was added, followed by a category for [[Hugo Award for Best Semiprozine|Best Semiprozine]] (semi-professional magazine) in 1984.<ref name="Hugo80"/><ref name="Hugo84"/> In 1983, members of the [[Church of Scientology]] were encouraged by people such as [[Charles Platt (author)|Charles Platt]] to nominate as a bloc ''[[Battlefield Earth (novel)|Battlefield Earth]]'', written by the organization's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]], for the Best Novel award; it did not make the final ballot.<ref name="BEscandal"/> Another campaign followed in 1987 to nominate Hubbard's ''[[Mission Earth (novel)|Black Genesis]]''; it made the final ballot but finished behind "no award".<ref name="BGscandal"/> 1989 saw a work—''The Guardsman'' by Todd Hamilton and P. J. Beese—withdrawn by its authors from the final ballot after a fan bought numerous memberships under false names, all sent in on the same day, in order to get the work onto the ballot.<ref name="OlderScandals"/>

In 1990 the Best Original Art Work award was given as an extra Hugo Award, and was listed again in 1991, though not actually awarded, and established afterward as an official Hugo Award.<ref name="91minutes"/><ref name="90minutes"/> It was then removed from this status in 1996, and has not been awarded since.<ref name="96minutes"/> The Retro Hugos were created in the mid-1990s, and were first awarded in 1996.<ref name="thafaq"/>

===Since 2000===
In 2003, the Dramatic Presentation award was split into two categories, Long Form and Short Form.<ref name="Hugo03"/> This was repeated with the Best Professional Editor category in 2007.<ref name="Hugo07"/> 2009 saw the addition of the [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story|Best Graphic Story]] category, while the most recent change to the Hugo Awards was in 2012, when an award for [[Hugo Award for Best Fancast|Best Fancast]] was added.<ref name="Hugo09"/><ref name="Hugo12"/>

In 2015, two groups of science fiction writers, the "[[Sad Puppies]]" led by [[Brad R. Torgersen]] and [[Larry Correia]], and the "Rabid Puppies" led by [[Vox Day]], each put forward a similar [[voting bloc|slate of suggested nominations]] which came to dominate the ballot.<ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015"/><ref name="Slate 8 April 2015"/> The Sad Puppies campaign had run for two years prior on a smaller scale, with limited success. The leaders of the campaigns characterized them as a reaction to "niche, academic, overtly [leftist]" nominees and winners in opposition to "an affirmative action award" that preferred female and non-white authors and characters.<ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015" /><ref name="Daily Telegraph 6 April 2015"/> In response, five nominees declined their nomination before and, for the first time, two after the ballot was published.<ref name="Hugo2015Stats"/><ref name="FirstAfter"/> Multiple-Hugo-winner [[Connie Willis]] declined to present the awards.<ref name="WillisDecline"/> The slates were characterized by some journalists as a "right wing",<ref name="The Guardian 9 April 2015" /> "orchestrated backlash"<ref name="The Guardian 6 April 2015"/> by a "group of white guys"<ref name="The A.V. Club 6 April 2015"/> and were linked with the [[Gamergate controversy]].<ref name="Slate 8 April 2015"/><ref name="Boston Globe 7 April 2015"/><ref name="The Sydney Morning Herald 9 April 2015"/> Multiple Hugo winner [[Samuel R. Delany]] characterized the campaigns as a response to "socio-economic" changes such as minority authors gaining prominence and thus "economic heft".<ref name="DelanySP"/> In all but the Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form category, "no award" placed above all nominees that were on either slate, and it won all five categories that only contained slate nominees.<ref name="Hugo2015Stats"/>

The only discontinued awards which were instated in the WSFS constitution as permanent categories were the Best Professional Magazine and Best Original Art Work Hugo Awards. Worldcon committees may also give out special awards during the Hugo ceremony, which are not voted on. Unlike the additional Hugo categories which Worldcons may present, these awards are not officially Hugo Awards and do not use the same trophy, though they once did.<ref name="thacat"/><ref name="Franson7"/> An additional award, the [[John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer]], is presented at the Hugo Award ceremony and voted by the same process, but is not formally a Hugo Award.<ref name="thacamp"/>

==Recognition==
The Hugo Award is highly regarded by observers. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' has termed it "among the highest honors bestowed in science fiction and fantasy writing",<ref name="LAT"/> a claim echoed by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', who said that it was "the premier award in the science fiction genre".<ref name="Wired"/> [[Justine Larbalestier]], in ''The Battle of the Sexes in Science Fiction'' (2002), referred to the awards as "the best known and most prestigious of the science fiction awards",<ref name="BOTSSF"/> and [[Jo Walton]], writing for ''[[Tor Books|Tor.com]]'', said it was "undoubtedly science fiction’s premier award".<ref name="TOR"/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' similarly acknowledged it as "a fine showcase for speculative fiction" as well as "one of the most venerable, democratic and international" science fiction awards "in existence".<ref name="GuardianHugo"/><ref name="GuardianHugo2"/> [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], in ''The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'' (1988), echoed ''The Guardian'''s statement of the award's democratic nature, saying that "because of its broad electorate" the Hugos were the awards most representative of "reader popularity".<ref name="TNESF"/> Camille Bacon-Smith, in ''Science Fiction Culture'' (2000), said that at the time fewer than 1000 people voted on the final ballot; she held, however, that this is a representative sample of the readership at large, given the number of winning novels that remain in print for decades or become notable outside of the science fiction genre, such as ''[[The Demolished Man]]'' or ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]''.<ref name="SFC"/> The 2014 awards saw over 1900 nomination submissions and over 3500 voters on the final slate, while the 1964 awards received 274 votes.<ref name="2014noms"/><ref name="2014voters"/><ref name="1964voters"/> The 2015 awards saw 2122 nominating ballots and 5950 votes.<ref name="2015noms"/><ref name="2015votes"/>

[[Brian Aldiss]], in his book ''Trillion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction'', claimed that the Hugo Award was a barometer of reader popularity, rather than artistic merit; he contrasted it with the panel-selected [[Nebula Award]], which provided "more literary judgment", though he did note that the winners of the two awards often overlapped.<ref name="TYS"/> Along with the Hugo Award, the Nebula Award is also considered one of the premier awards in science fiction, with Laura Miller of [[Salon.com]] terming it "science fiction's most prestigious award".<ref name="SALONnebula"/>

The official logo of the Hugo Awards is often placed on the winning books' cover as a promotional tool.<ref name="HugoLogo"/><ref name="ScalziLogo"/> [[Gahan Wilson]], in ''First World Fantasy Awards'' (1977), claimed that noting that a book had won the Hugo Award on the cover "demonstrably" increased sales for that novel,<ref name="FWFA"/> though [[Orson Scott Card]] said in his 1990 book ''How to Write Science Fiction & Fantasy'' that the award had a larger effect on foreign sales than in the United States.<ref name="HWSFF"/> [[Spider Robinson]], in 1992, claimed that publishers were very interested in authors that won a Hugo Award, more so than for other awards such as the Nebula Award.<ref name="SFC"/> Literary agent Richard Curtis said in his 1996 ''Mastering the Business of Writing'' that having the term Hugo Award on the cover, even as a nominee, was a "powerful inducement" to science fiction fans to buy a novel,<ref name="MBW"/> while Jo Walton claimed in 2011 that the Hugo is the only science fiction award "that actually affects sales of a book".<ref name="TOR"/>

There have been several anthologies collecting Hugo-winning short fiction. The series ''[[The Hugo Winners]]'', edited by [[Isaac Asimov]], was started in 1962 as a collection of short story winners up to the previous year, and concluded with the 1982 Hugos in Volume 5. ''[[The New Hugo Winners]]'', edited originally by Asimov, later by [[Connie Willis]] and finally by [[Gregory Benford]], has four volumes collecting stories from the 1983 to the 1994 Hugos.<ref name="AWCGSF"/> The most recent anthology is ''The Hugo Award Showcase'' (2010), edited by [[Mary Robinette Kowal]], which contains most of the short stories, novelettes, and novellas that were nominated for the 2009 award.<ref name="THAS"/>
