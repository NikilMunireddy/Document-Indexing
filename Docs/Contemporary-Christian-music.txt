'''Contemporary Christian music''' (or '''CCM'''—and occasionally "'''inspirational music'''") is a genre of modern [[popular music]] which is lyrically focused on matters concerned with the [[Christianity|Christian faith]]. It formed as those affected by the 1960s [[Jesus movement]] revival began to express themselves in a more contemporary style of music than the [[hymn]]s, [[Gospel music|Gospel]] and [[Southern Gospel]] music that was prevalent in the church at the time. Today, the term is typically used to refer to [[pop music|pop]], [[Rock music|rock]], or [[Contemporary worship music|praise & worship]] styles.

It has representation on several music charts including ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[List of number-one Billboard Christian Albums|Christian Albums]], [[Christian Songs]], Hot Christian AC (Adult Contemporary), Christian CHR, Soft AC/Inspirational, and Christian Digital Songs as well as the UK's [[Official Christian & Gospel Albums Chart]]. Top-selling CCM artists will also appear on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In the [[iTunes Store]], the genre is represented as part of the Christian and gospel genre.<ref>In the US iTunes store, the section is entitled ''Christian & Gospel''. In the UK iTunes store, it's ''Gospel''. Canada's and Australia's iTunes section is entitled ''Inspirational''.</ref>

== History ==

The growing popularity in the styles of Rock 'n 'Roll music in the 1950s was initially dismissed by the church because it was believed to encourage sinfulness. Yet as evangelical churches adapted to appeal to more people, the musical styles used in worship changed as well by adopting the sounds of this popular style.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CAS – Central Authentication Service|url = http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2234810?q=contemporary+christian+music&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|website = www.oxfordmusiconline.com.ezproxy2.library.arizona.edu|accessdate = 2015-10-05}}</ref>

The genre became known as contemporary Christian music as a result of the [[Jesus movement]] revival in the latter 1960s and early 1970s,<ref name="BanjoWilliams">Banjo, Omotayo O., and Williams, Kesha Morant.

Contemporary Christian music had its own magazines, radio stations, and award shows. The Jesus movement revival was over.}}</ref> "Jesus Music" started by playing instruments and singing songs about love and peace, which then translated into love of God. Paul Wohlegemuth, who wrote the book ''Rethinking Church Music'', said "[the] 1970s will see a marked acceptance of rock-influenced music in all levels of church music. The rock style will become more familiar to all people, its rhythmic excesses will become refined, and its earlier secular associations will be less remembered."<ref>Baker, Paul. Page 140. ''Contemporary Christian Music: Where it came from What it is Where It's Going''. Westchester, Illinois: Crossway Books, 1985. Print.</ref>

[[Larry Norman]] is often remembered as the "father of Christian rock", because of his early contributions (before the [[Jesus movement]]) to the developing new genre that mixed rock rhythms with the Christian messages.<ref name=":0">Hevesi, Dennis.

== Style and artists ==

Contemporary Christian music has influences from folk, gospel, pop and rock music.<ref name="Nantais196.18" /> Genres of music such as soft rock, folk rock, alternative, hip-hop, etc. have played a large influence on CCM.<ref>Mumford, Lawrence R. "A variety of religious composition: the music we sing, in and out of church, is more varied and interesting than we've been led to believe." Christianity Today June 2011: 42+. Fine Arts and Music Collection. Web. February 8, 2014.</ref>

Charismatic churches have had a large influence on contemporary Christian music and are one of the largest producers of CCM. [[Hillsong Church]] is one of the many prominent CCM artists.<ref>Evans, Mark. ''Studies in Popular Music : Open up the Doors : Music in the Modern Church.'' London: Equinox Publishing Ltd , 2006. eBook.</ref> Contemporary Christian music has also expanded into many [[subgenre]]s.<ref name="Nantais196.18"/> [[Christian punk]], [[Christian hardcore]], [[Christian metal]], and [[Christian hip hop]], which, although not normally considered CCM, can also come under the genre's umbrella.<ref name="Powell_Fe">{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark Allan |title=Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |year=2002 |publisher=Hendrickson Publishers |location=[[Peabody, Massachusetts|Peabody]], [[Massachusetts]] |isbn=1-56563-679-1 |edition=First printing}}</ref> [[Contemporary worship music]] is also incorporated in modern CCM. [[Contemporary worship]] is both recorded and performed during [[church service]]s.

Artists who assisted CCM to become popular were [[Amy Grant]], [[Michael W. Smith]], [[Phil Keaggy]] and [[John Elefante]].<ref name="Nantais196.18" /> Several mainstream artists, such as [[The Byrds]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Creed (band)|Creed]], [[Lifehouse (band)|Lifehouse]] and [[U2]], have dealt with Christian themes in their music, yet are not part of the CCM industry.<ref name="Powell_Fe" /> Other artists representing the genre include

== Controversy ==

Contemporary Christian music has been a topic of controversy in various ways since its beginnings in the 1960s.<ref name="Powell_Fe" /> The Christian college [[Bob Jones University]] discourages its dormitory students from listening to CCM.<ref name="BJU_Hall">{{cite web |url=http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/residence.php |title=BJU ~ Residence Hall Life |accessdate=March 21, 2009 |publisher=[[Bob Jones University]] }}</ref> Others simply find the concept of Christian pop/rock music to be an unusual phenomenon, since rock music has historically been associated with themes such as sexual [[promiscuity]], [[rebellion]], [[drug]] and [[alcohol]] use, and other topics normally considered antithetical to the teachings of Christianity.<ref name="Powell_Fe" /> This controversy caused by evangelical pop music was explored by Gerald Clarke in his [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]<!-- stylized TIME --> magazine article "New Lyrics for the Devil's Music".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,141289,00.html | work=Time | title=New Lyrics for the Devil's Music | first=Gerald | last=Clarke | date=June 24, 2001}}</ref>

Some writers from the [[Reformed Presbyterian Church (denominational group)|Reformed Presbyterian]] tradition assert that the inclusion of CCM in a worship service violates the [[Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image|second commandment]] and the [[Regulative Principle of Worship]] because it adds man-made inventions, lyrics and instrumental music to the biblically appointed way of worshipping God.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reformedonline.com/view/reformedonline/music.htm | title=Musical Instruments in the Public Worship of God | first=Brian | last=Schwertley}}</ref>

Contemporary Christian musicians and listeners have sought to extend it into settings where religious music traditionally might not be heard.{{Vague|date=January 2013}} [[MercyMe]]'s song "[[I Can Only Imagine (MercyMe song)|I Can Only Imagine]]" was a crossover success despite having a clear Christian message.<ref name="FOXNewsJuly062003">{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,91175,00.html|title=Christian Rock Crosses Over|last=Adams|first=Ramsay|date=July 6, 2003|publisher=[[Fox News]]|accessdate=October 6, 2010}}</ref>

Paul Baker, author of ''Contemporary Christian Music'', addressed the question, "Is the music a ministry, or is it entertainment? The motives, on both sides, were nearly always sincere and well intentioned, rarely malicious."<ref>Baker, Paul. Page 133. ''Contemporary Christian Music: Where it came from What it is Where It's Going.'' Westchester, Illinois: Crossway Books, 1985. Print.</ref>

"The responsibility of the church is not to provide escape from reality," according to Donald Ellsworth, the author of ''Christian Music in Contemporary Witness'', "but to give answers to contemporary problems through legitimate, biblical means."<ref>Ellsworth, Donald. Christian Music in Contemporary Witness: Historical Antecedents and Contemporary Practices. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Baker Book House, 1979. Print.</ref>

Many studies on [[church growth]] show that churches have grown in size after changing the style of music.<ref>[http://hirr.hartsem.edu/research/fastfacts/fast_facts.html#WebsiteGrowth Fast Facts about American Religion]. Hirr.hartsem.edu (May 6, 1998). Retrieved on 2013-09-04.</ref> [[James Emery White]], a consultant for preaching and worship within the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], made a statement about how many churches that changed styles to using more contemporary Christian music, appeared to have a quicker growth.<ref>Miller, Steve.

== Growth ==

The contemporary Christian music industry has grown over the years. Album sales have increased from 31 million in 1996 to 44 million sales in 2000. Since EMI's purchase of [[Sparrow Records]], sales have increased 100 percent. However, the main goal of the label continues to be aspiring to make a positive impact on the world through contemporary Christian music. The company has given back money to the CCM community.<ref>Black, Beau. "CCM's growing pains: a survey of labels finds the message--if not the creativity--is intact. (music)."
