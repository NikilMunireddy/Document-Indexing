'''Albert Karl Ludwig Gotthilf Günther''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], also '''Albert Charles Lewis Gotthilf Günther''' (3 October 1830 – 1 February 1914), was a [[Germany|German]]-born British [[zoologist]], [[ichthyologist]], and [[herpetologist]]. Günther is currently ranked the second-most productive reptile taxonomist (after [[George Albert Boulenger]]) with more than 340 reptile species described.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Uetz | first1 = P | year = 2010 | title = The original descriptions of reptiles | url = | journal = Zootaxa | volume = 2334 | issue = | pages = 59–68 }}</ref><ref>Uetz, P.

==Early life and career==
Günther was born in [[Esslingen (district)|Esslingen]] in [[Swabia]] ([[Württemberg]]). His father was a ''Stiftungs-Commissar'' in Esslingen and his mother was Eleonora Nagel. He initially schooled at the Stuttgart Gymnasium. His family wished him to train for the ministry of the Lutheran Church for which he moved to the University of Tübingen. A brother shifted from [[theology]] to medicine, and he, too, turned to science and medicine at [[Tübingen]] in 1852. His first work was "''Ueber den Puppenzustand eines Distoma''". He graduated in medicine with an M.D. from Tübingen in 1858, the same year in which he published a handbook of zoology for students of medicine. His mother moved to England, and when he visited it in 1855, he met [[John Edward Gray]] and Professor [[Richard Owen]] at the British Museum. This led to an offer to work at the [[British Museum]] in 1857, where his first task was to classify 2000 snake specimens. After the death of John Edward Gray in 1875, Günther was appointed [[Keeper of Zoology]] at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], a position he held until 1895. The major work of his life was the eight-volume ''Catalogue of Fishes'' (1859–1870, [[Ray Society]]). He also worked on the [[reptiles]] and [[amphibians]] in the museum [[Collection (museum)|collection]]. In 1864, he founded the ''[[The Zoological Record|Record of Zoological Literature]]'' and served as [[editor in chief|editor]] for six years.<ref name=prsl /> He was one of the editors for the [[Journal of Natural History|''Annals and Magazine of Natural History'']] for more than thirty years.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary.

==Royal Society==
Günther was elected [[fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1867 and served as vice-president 1875–6. He served on the council of the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]] for nearly 40 years (1868–1905). He was elected fellow of the [[Linnaean Society]] in 1877, and was president 1896–1900. He became a naturalised British citizen in 1874. Günther died at [[Kew Gardens]] on 1 February 1914.<ref name=prsl>{{cite journal | author=M, WC | title=Obituary Notices of Fellows Deceased. A. C. L. G.

==Family==

Günther was the son of Friedrich Gotthilf Günther (1800–?) and Eleanore Louise née Nagle (1806–1899).

He married, firstly, in 1868, Roberta Mitchell née McIntosh (1842–1869), sister of [[William M'Intosh|William M‘Intosh]]. They had one son, the historian [[Robert Gunther|Robert William Theodore Günther]] (1869–1940). Roberta died shortly after his birth.

In 1879 he married again, to Theodora Dowrish née Drake (1863–1944). They had a son Frederic Albert Günther (1883–1853), a merchant; and a daughter Theodora Alberta Günther (1889–1908) who died aged nineteen.
