'''HNK Hajduk Split''', commonly referred to as '''Hajduk Split''' ({{IPA-sh|xǎjduːk splît|hr}}) or simply '''Hajduk''', is a [[Croatia]]n [[association football|football]] club founded in 1911, and based in the city of [[Split (city)|Split]]. The club's home ground, since 1979, is the 35,000-seat [[Poljud Stadium]], and the team's traditional home colors are white shirts with blue shorts and socks.

Hajduk was founded by a group of Split students in a famous tavern known as [[U Fleků]] in [[Prague]]. Between the early 1920s and 1940, Hajduk regularly participated in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] [[Yugoslav First League|national championship]]. Following [[World War II]] and the formation of the Yugoslav league system in 1946, Hajduk went on to spend the entire [[SFR Yugoslavia]] period in top level. Their run continued following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], as the club joined the [[Prva HNL|Croatian First League]] in its inaugural season in 1992, never having been relegated from its top tier. They are one of the most successful teams in Croatia and ex-Yugoslavia, having won nine Yugoslav and six Croatian league championships, in addition to nine Yugoslav and five Croatian cup titles, without ever being relegated from its countries top football league.

The club's "golden era" came in the 1970s, when they won four Yugoslav leagues and five Yugoslav cups. Hajduk is also the only club in Yugoslav football history that has won 5 consecutive Yugoslav cups (between 1972 and 1977), and also the only unbeaten champion (season [[1950 Yugoslav First League|1950]]). Hajduk`s biggest European achievements are three [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] quarterfinals, one [[UEFA Cup]] semifinal, and one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] semifinal.

The club's main rivals are [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]], and a match between the two is referred to as the "[[Eternal derby (Croatia)|Eternal Derby]]". Hajduk Split fans are called [[Torcida Split]], who are the oldest organized firm in Europe, being founded in 1950. The inspiration of the name were Brazilian fans at the 1950 World Cup that were called "Torcida".

As of 2008 the club is a stock company, although not listed on the public stock exchange, with majority of the stock owned by the city of Split. It is one of two fan-owned sports teams in Croatia, numbering over 37,000 members <ref name="hajdukčlanstvo">{{cite web|url=http://hajduk.hr/eng/club/membership |title=Membership |publisher=Hajduk.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-05-11}}</ref> and over 50 fan clubs situated mostly across Croatia and Germany. <ref name="hajdukdph">{{cite web|url=http://hajduk.hr/eng/club/hajduks-friends-society |title=Society of Hajduk Friends |publisher=Hajduk.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-05-11}}</ref>

== History ==

===Origins===
[[File:Founding of Hajduk.jpg|thumb|Founding members of Hajduk, in the [[U Fleků]] inn in [[Prague]]]]

The club was founded in the centuries-old pub [[U Fleků]] in [[Prague]] (then also part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), by a group of students from Split: Fabijan Kaliterna, Lucijan Stella, Ivan Šakić and Vjekoslav Ivanišević.<ref name="hist">Dalibor Brozović. "Hrvatska enciklopedija: ''Volume 1''", 1999.</ref> They went to the pub following a match between [[AC Sparta Prague|AC Sparta]] and [[SK Slavia Praha|SK Slavia]] and decided it was time their own town founded a professional club. They all knew how popular the sport was in their home Split, and how well their friends can play.

The club was officially registered with the authorities on February 13, 1911.<ref name="Hajduk1911">{{cite web|url=http://hajduk.hr/eng/history/1911-1920 |title=HNK Hajduk Split—History: 1911 - 1920 |publisher=Hajduk.hr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref> While trying to come up with a name for the club (other options being "Velebit", "Uskok", "Marjan"...), the students went to their old teacher Josip Barač for advice and according to accounts, after enthusiastically storming into his office, he told them to take the name "Hajduk" which symbolized "that which is best in our people: bravery, humanity, friendship, love of freedom, defiance to powers, and protection of the weak. Be worthy of that great name."<ref name="vjesnik">[http://www.vjesnik.hr/html/2009/03/28/Clanak.asp?r=sta&c=2 Vjesnik: Po kome je Hajduk dobio ime?]{{dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref>

[[Hajduk]]s were romanticized bandits that fought the rule of the Ottoman Turks. It is speculated that famed hajduk [[Andrija Šimić]], who triumphantly arrived in Split in 1902 to cheering crowds (after a long stint in an Austrian prison), was perhaps the inspiration for the name.<ref name="vjesnik"/> The founders subsequently designed the club's emblem, and a group of Catholic nuns from a monastery in Split, created copies which were distributed to fans.<ref>[http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hajduk/tabid/83/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/4012/Default.aspx Hajduk's membership pass - Lord help us!], [[Slobodna Dalmacija]]</ref> Both the name and the checkered board on the crest were found provocative by the Monarchy, but it eventually allowed them having been convinced that a football club is a good way to train soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hajduckiportal.hr/osnivanje-hajduka-2/ |title=Osnivanje Hajduka |publisher=hajduckiportal.hr |date= |language=hr |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref>

Hajduk gathered the pro-Croat party of citizens of Split, Croat unionists or puntari. That is why the club specifically has the name "hrvatski nogometni klub" (Croatian football club) and has the Croatian coat-of-arms in its crest. The club itself was against the Austrian-Hungarian government's policy of not allowing the unification of the Croatian provinces and keeping them separated (the government and the emperor did not allow the reunion of Dalmatia with the rest of Croatia). Hajduk's first opponent were Calcio Spalato, the club of an autonomist party from in Split, and the match ended with a 9-0 (6-0) victory for Hajduk. The first to score for Hajduk was Šime Raunig, legend has it - with his knee.

[[File:Zrinjski - Hajduk Split.jpg|thumb|left|Before the match: Hajduk played [[HŠK Zrinjski Mostar]] on 13 August 1939, winning 3-2.]]
In 1912, Hajduk played their first match in Zagreb against the [[HAŠK]] football club, and lost 3-2. The first international match against an eminent opponent was held in 1913 against the Czech squad [[Slavia Prague]],<ref>[http://www.slavia.cz/Historie-1913?menuid=707 Slavia] {{wayback|url=http://www.slavia.cz/Historie-1913?menuid=707 |date=20110927111857 |df=y }}</ref> which at that time were one of the strongest squads in Europe. Hajduk ended up losing the game by 1-13 (0-13). After the formation of the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]], Hajduk first entered Yugoslav league in 1923, losing their first and only game that season against [[NK SAŠK Napredak|SAŠK]]. However, that same year while on tour in North Africa, Hajduk defeated [[Olympique Marseille]] by 3-2 in their first international match, sparking mass celebrations in home city. The very next year team was considered so strong that 10 out of 11 players that played an international friendly for [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] were contracted to Hajduk (only exception being the goalkeeper, as Hajduk had an Italian keeper at the time). In 1926 in honour of the clubs 15th birthday, composer [[Ivo Tijardović]] dedicated an operetta "Kraljica baluna" to the club, making it the only football club in the world to have its own operetta. Apart from national championship, from 1920 to 1936 Hajduk continuously competed in Dalmatian Championship, having won all but one of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hajduk.hr/eng/history/1921-1930 |title=HNK Hajduk Split—History: 1921 - 1930 |publisher=Hajduk.hr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref>

Hajduk reached their first period of glory in the late twenties, when they won their first two Yugoslav championships (1927 and 1929), which earned them a slot in the Central European Cup.<ref name="hajduk20s">{{cite web|url=http://www.dalmacijanews.com/Hajduk/View/tabid/88/ID/46753/Hajduk-uzletio-1920-te-prva-dva-naslova-stigla-u-Split.aspx |title=Hajduk uzletio 1920-te, prva dva naslova stigla u Split |publisher=Dalmacijanews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref> Some of the best players in that period were [[Leo Lemešić]] and [[Vladimir Kragić]], with [[Ljubo Benčić]] managed to become the best goalscorer of the [[1927 Yugoslav Football Championship|1927 season]]. Long lasting coach of the team was one of clubs greats, [[Luka Kaliterna]]. During the [[Yugoslav Partisans|6 January Dictatorship]] the adjective "Croatian" in "Croatian Football Club" was forcibly replaced by the adjective "Yugoslav" to the dismay of the team. Furthermore, the 1930s proved disastrous for Hajduk, as they won no tournaments or championships, recording only a few successes in international matches.<ref name="hajduk30s">{{cite web|url=http://www.dalmacijanews.com/Hajduk/View/tabid/88/ID/46839/Hajdukove-tridesete--godine-krize-i-inozemnih-turneja.aspx |title=Hajdukove tridesete - godine krize i inozemnih turneja |publisher=Dalmacijanews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref>

They did manage to win one title during the [[Banovina of Croatia]] era in 1940-41, with an impressive 14-3-1 record. As a Croatian champion the club was about the play the playoffs for Yugoslav championship but with World War II emerging championship was never finished. During the time Hajduk could have had a fantastic generation lead by young [[Frane Matošić]], [[Ratko Kacijan]], and prominent Czech international [[Jiri Sobotka]].<ref name="jutarnji.hr">{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/ostavite-hajduk-na-miru--netko-vas-je-gadno-zajebao--to-nije-vas-klub/1143535/ |title=Ostavite Hajduk na miru, netko vas je gadno zajebao: to nije vaš klub |work=[[Jutarnji list]] |date=30 November 2013 |language=hr |accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref>

===World War II===
In April 1941, during [[World War II]], Yugoslavia was invaded, occupied, and carved-up by the [[Axis powers]], with Split being annexed directly into Italy. Residents and players were both opposed to the assimilation to Italy, thus the club ceased to compete in defiance throughout the occupation of Split, declining an offer to join the Italian first division under the name "AC Spalato". Instead, Mussolini founded Societa Calcio Spalato, and renamed the club's home ground after his son's name.<ref name="jutarnji.hr"/> After capitulation of Italy in 1943, the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] temporarily liberated Split and disarmed the Italian garrison, but the Germans re-occupied the city and granted it to the fascist puppet government of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH) they had installed in Zagreb back in 1941. The attitude of the club did not change when the NDH authorities attempted to include Hajduk in the Independent State of Croatia Cup as NDH earned resentment in Split for allying and partitioning them to Italy. With the Allies occupying southern Italy and controlling the Mediterranean, the Adriatic islands became a haven for the resistance, prompting Hajduk's rebirth on one of them in 1944.

The club's players then joined the Partisan general headquarters on the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] in the [[Adriatic sea]]. On 7 May 1944 on the [[Calendar of saints|Feast]] of [[Saint Domnius]], the patron saint of Split, in presence of Tito's and British officers (one of them being [[Randolph Churchill]])<ref name="Gazetto dello Sport">{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/talijani-se-raspisali-o-hajduku--slavni-klub-koji-je-odbio-mussolinija--pavelica-i-tita-/1156188/ |title=Hajduk - slavni klub koji je odbio Mussolinija, Pavelića i Tita |work=Jutarnji.hr |date=2014-01-18|accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref> Hajduk was formed again and began playing as the official football team of the Yugoslav resistance. They competed with Allied service football teams from across the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] in Italy, where they famously played the British army in a friendly match in [[Bari]] on 23 September, in front at least 40.000 spectators, losing 2-7.<ref name="hajduk.hr">{{cite web|url=http://hajduk.hr/eng/history/1941-1950 |title=HNK Hajduk Split—History: 1941 - 1950 |publisher=Hajduk.hr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref> The game is considered to be one of the most attended football games during the war years, with a rematch in liberated Split few years after (Hajduk won 1-0). At this time, the club leadership adopted the Partisans' [[red star]] as the badge on the white-and-blue club dress. During 1945, Hajduk embarked on a tourney through [[Egypt]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Malta]]. Traveling roughly 30.000 kilometers, and playing over 90 games, club won 74 of them, while at the same time Allied airplanes dropped fliers all over Europe prompting other football clubs to follow Hajduk example.<ref>Cerjan, Stjepan. Hajduk – tim NOVJ u: ''Enciklopedija hrvatske povijesti i kulture'', Školska knjiga, 1980., stranice 195-196.</ref> While in Beirut, [[Charles de Gaulle]] gave Hajduk the title of honorary team of Free France, trophy being treasured ever since.

With its proficiency and its "unique [[Dalmatia]]n spirit", the club reportedly impressed [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], who frequently attended matches. After the war, he invited Hajduk to move to the Yugoslav capital [[Belgrade]] and become the official [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) team, but the club refused, wanting to continue to play in their hometown of Split.<ref name="hajduk.hr"/> One of their biggest future rivals [[FK Partizan Beograd|FK Partizan]] were founded instead. The club, however, continued to enjoy the reputation of "Tito's favorite" long after the war, and it was because of the friendly relationship with the resistance, it became one of the few Yugoslav football clubs (and the only prominent one), not to be disbanded after the war by the communist government (as was the case with a number of other clubs, especially prominent ones such as [[BSK Beograd|BSK]], [[Građanski Zagreb|Građanski]], [[SK Jugoslavija|Jugoslavija]], [[HŠK Concordia|Concordia]], [[HAŠK]], and [[FK Slavija|Slavija]]).

===Iconic 1950s===

[[File:Hajduk 1955.jpg|thumb|Hajduk's squad in 1955, wearing the red star badge]]

After World War II, Hajduk continued to play in the Yugoslav championship and its Cup. In 1946, they won Croatian championship and established the magazine "Journal of Hajduk". In 1948–1949, Hajduk visited Australia and became the first team from Yugoslavia to play on all continents. The club won the [[1950 Yugoslav First League|1950 Yugoslav championship]] without a single loss,<ref name="hajduk.hr"/> setting a record that no one managed to accomplish before the breakup of Yugoslavia 40 years later. On 28 October 1950, a day before a decisive match against one of its biggest rivals [[FK Crvena Zvezda Beograd|Red Star]] (a 2–1 win), the official fan organization [[Torcida Split|Torcida]] was founded.<ref name="torcida">[http://www.torcida.hr/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=47&Itemid=98 Torcida Split: Povijest-Osnivanje Torcide ] {{wayback|url=http://www.torcida.hr/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=47&Itemid=98 |date=20110217032145 |df=y }}</ref> It was created by engineering student Vjenceslav Žuvela, who chose the name after the enthusiastic [[Brazil]]ian fans, and Torcida become the first organized group of supporters in Europe.<ref>[http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/blog/dirty-tackle/post/Hajduk-Split-fans-celebrate-centenary-by-engulfi?urn=sow-320948 Hajduk Split fans celebrate centenary by engulfing city in flares] {{wayback|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/soccer/blog/dirty-tackle/post/Hajduk-Split-fans-celebrate-centenary-by-engulfi?urn=sow-320948 |date=20110218030205 |df=y }}</ref> The following year, reconstruction of "[[Stadion Stari plac|Stari Plac]]" stadium was finished, and it homed the club for more than three decades.

Consequent seasons showed Hajduk's supremacy, but also the political manipulations to prevent them winning the championships. For one, Torcida was viewed as a hostile organization by the communist authorities, which posed a risk to the national consciousness of the new Yugoslavian state.<ref name="torcida"/> Hajduk's leadership was sanctioned, the team's captain expelled from the communist party, and Vjenceslav Žuvela imprisoned.<ref name="torcida"/> Also, during the winter break of the [[1952–53 Yugoslav First League|1952–53 season]], following an invitation from [[Juan Perón]], Hajduk went on tour to South America and eventually extended their stay there.<ref name="hajduk50s">{{cite web|url=http://www.dalmacijanews.com/Hajduk/View/tabid/88/ID/47082/Pedesetima-dominirala-zlatna-Hajdukova-generacija.aspx |title=Torcida Split: Povijest- 1951. - 1960 |publisher=Dalmacijanews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref> This caused them to come home late, but instead of promised delay of games in the Championship, they faced defeat against [[OFK Beograd|BSK]] and a draw with [[FK Spartak Zlatibor Voda|Spartak Subotica]] as their youth team and couple of veteran players had to play them.<ref name="hajduk50s"/> Although Hajduk later beat both Red Star (4-1) and Partizan (4-2) in Belgrade, Red Star became the champion by only a two-point margin.

Next season saw a similar occurrence with players [[Vladimir Beara]] and [[Bernard Vukas]] arriving late for national team training and receiving a month-long ban from football. Without these essential players Hajduk lost important matches, and [[NK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo]] emerged as champions. All this prompted the club legend [[Frane Matošić]] to storm a meeting of the [[Football Association of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Football Association]] quipping, "Have you at least a gram of integrity?".<ref name="hajduk1950s">{{cite news|url=http://www.dalmacijanews.com/Hajduk/View/tabid/88/ID/47082/Pedesetima-dominirala-zlatna-Hajdukova-generacija.aspx |title=Pedesetima dominirala zlatna Hajdukova generacija |last=Princivali |first=Ivan |date=8 February 2011 |work=dalmacijanews.com |language=Croatian |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> On 3 April 1955 in Zagreb, Hajduk defeated Dinamo 6–0, recording its biggest win in the [[Eternal derby (Croatia)|derby]] between the two largest Croatian clubs, and later won the championship. However, the Football Association of Yugoslavia qualified them to the European [[Mitropa Cup]], while Partizan was chosen to participate in the inaugural [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]].<ref name="hajduk1950s"/>

During the early 1950s club had one of its most iconic generation of players, winning three Yugoslav championships. Two of them, goalkeeper [[Vladimir Beara]] and Zagreb-born midfielder [[Bernard Vukas]] (called "Bajdo") were called to represent Team Europe in friendly games against Great Britain. In one of them, Vukas scored a hat-trick. Apart from them, Frane Matošić reached his 729 goals in 739 official and unofficial games, achieving a club's record which is certainly never to be reached again. Other famous players include [[Božo Broketa]], [[Ljubomir Kokeza]], [[Slavko Luštica]], [[Lenko Grčić]] etc.

===Miserable 1960s and another Golden Generation===
[[File:Hajduk logo.png|thumb|Hajduk's red star logo from 1960-1990.]]

Generation of 1950's broke down after 1955 title, with Matošić retiring, Beara moving to Red Star, and Vukas to [[AC Bologna|Bologna]]. The 1960s were remembered as some of the hardest times in Hajduk's history. In four seasons from 1963 to 1966 club finished no better than 10th, and no better than 4th in the next half of the decade. In the [[1965–66 Yugoslav First League|1965–66 season]], due to "Planinić affair" accusing Hajduk of rigging games during the unsuccessful seasons, five-points were deducted (initial fine was relegation!), and Hajduk struggled to stay in the top tier, much thanks to [[Petar Nadoveza]] who managed to become the league's top scorer (21 goals) regardless the club's poor performances. During this era club only managed to win a single trophy - the [[1966–67 Yugoslav Cup|1967 cup]], which was also their first Yugoslav cup trophy and send the team to [[1967-68 European Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] the next year, their first appearance under [[UEFA]] led international competition.<ref name="hajduk1960s">{{cite news|url=http://www.dalmacijanews.com/Hajduk/View/tabid/88/ID/47178/Sezdesete-Najteze-razdoblje-u-Hajdukovoj-povijesti.aspx |title=Šezdesete: Najteže razdoblje u Hajdukovoj povijesti |last=Princivali |first=Ivan |date=9 February 2011 |work=dalmacijanews.com |language=Croatian |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> Among prominent players of the time were [[Ante Žanetić]], member of [[World Soccer (magazine)|1960 World Soccer Team of the Year]], [[Ivica Hlevnjak]], [[Vinko Cuzzi]] and [[Andrija Anković]].

From 1970–1980 Hajduk had achieved its most successful years in [[SFR Yugoslavia]]. The new "[[Golden Generation]]" won five consecutive cups and four championships in the period from 1972 to 1979, accompanied by notable international success.<ref name="hajduk1970s">{{cite news|url=http://www.dalmacijanews.com/Hajduk/View/tabid/88/ID/47268/Hajdukova-zlatna-generacija-obiljezila-sedamdesete.aspx |title=Hajdukova zlatna generacija obilježila sedamdesete |last=Princivali |first=Ivan |date=10 February 2011 |work=dalmacijanews.com |language=Croatian |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> In 1971, Hajduk won the title after 16 years after a memorable 4-3 away win over Partizan in a decisive away game they were losing 0–3. This unexpected success was achieved with a team of youngsters, and Nadoveza as a league top scorer yet another time. After winning their first out of five consecutive domestic cups in 1972, the team achieved first major international success playing semifinals of next year's [[1972-73 European Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] against [[Leeds United]]. Team's manager was one of Croatia's finest, [[Branko Zebec]].

After Zebec left the club he was replaced by young and talented [[Tomislav Ivić]] who would later become the clubs coaching legend and one of the most successful managers in Europe recording 8 league titles in 7 different countries.<ref name="index.hr">{{cite web|url=http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/gazzetta-dello-sport-tomislav-ivic-je-najuspjesniji-trener-u-povijesti/345000.aspx |title=Gazzeto dello Sport: Tomislav Ivić je najuspješniji trener u povijesti |publisher=Index.hr |date= |accessdate=2016-03-06}}</ref> First three years under Ivić saw Hajduk winning two Yugoslav titles and three cups. In [[1975-76 Yugoslav First League|1976]] it could have been third straight [[Double (association football)|Double]] after defeating the top league team FK Partizan [[Partizan Belgrade 1-6 Hajduk Split (9 May 1976)| 6-1 on away ground]], if there wasn't for a scandal in the last round game when Partizan won Olimpija scoring in 95th minute of the game (even thought UEFA didn't introduce additional time for another 20 years) after a numerous dubious referee decisions during the whole game. With season ending Ivić left for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], but would return two years later only to win another league title, club's last in former Yugoslavia.

During the time Hajduk reached quarterfinals of both [[1975-76 European Cup|European Cup]] and [[1977-78 European Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], with notable home wins against likes of [[PSV Eindhoven]] (2-0), [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] (2-1) and [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint Etienne]] (4-1). Notable Hajduk and Yugoslav international players include goalkeepers [[Ivan Katalinić]] and [[Radomir Vukčević]], defenders [[Ivan Buljan]] (1975 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year), [[Zoran Vujović]], [[Dragan Holcer]], [[Vilson Džoni]], [[Luka Peruzović]] and [[Vedran Rožić]], midfielders [[Jurica Jerković]], [[Dražen Mužinić]] (1975 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year), [[Branko Oblak]] (1974 Ballon d'Or candidate) and strikers [[Ivica Šurjak]] (1976 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year) and [[Slaviša Žungul]]. Club's respected president at the time was Tito Kirigin.

===Poljud curse===

In 1979, Hajduk moved to the newly designed stadium at [[Stadion Poljud|Poljud]] built to host [[1979 Mediterranean Games]]. However, the 1980s were noticeably less successful, as club recorded only three Yugoslav cups before country fell apart in 1991. Often is this linked to attributes of their new home which had athletic running track opposed to Stari Plac where supporters could cheer much closely to their team. Inaugural season at Poljud saw Hajduk's most iconic official international game in [[1979-80 European Cup]] quarterfinals against later finalists [[Hamburger SV]], and a 3-2 home win after losing 0-1 away, being unfortunately eliminated. Later years had Hajduk achieve memerable home wins against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] (4-1), [[FC Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] (4-1), [[Olympique de Marseille]] (2-0), [[Tottenham Hotspur|Tottenham]] (2-1) and a friendly win against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (6-0) considered to be United's biggest loss outside England. Hajduk also eliminated clubs such as [[FC Metz|Metz]] (5-1, 2-2), [[VfB Stuttgart]] (3-1, 2-2), [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] (3-1, 1-1), [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] (2-0, 1-0), and [[Sparta Prague]] (2-0, 0-1), reaching [[UEFA Cup]] semifinals in [[1983-84 UEFA Cup|1984]] and quarterfinals in [[1985-86 UEFA Cup|1986]]. In [[1987–88 European Cup Winners' Cup|1988]], during a Cup Winners' Cup home game with Qlympique Marseille, crowd trouble caused the game to be canceled at 2-0 for Hajduk and awarded 0-3 to Marseille, with Hajduk banned from all UEFA competitions for the next two years.

Apart from international success, domestic result were not as good. Although Hajduk spent entire decide near the top of the league table competing with Dinamo Zagreb, Partizan and Red Star, forming what will be known as "Great Yugoslav Four", no title was won before Croatia became independent. Prominent players of the time were goalkeepers [[Ivan Pudar]] and [[Zoran Simović]] (1983 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year), defenders [[Boro Primorac]], [[Branko Miljuš]] and [[Jerko Tipurić]], midfielders [[Blaž Slišković]] (1985 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year), [[Ivan Gudelj]] (1982 Yugoslav Footballer of the Year), [[Zoran Vulić]], [[Aljoša Asanović]], [[Stipe Andrijašević]], [[Dragutin Čelić]] and striker [[Zlatko Vujović]] (1981 Ballon d'Or candidate).<ref name="hajduk1980s">{{cite news|url=http://www.dalmacijanews.com/Hajduk/View/tabid/88/ID/47320/Osamdesete-Velika-generacija-koja-je-mogla-i-vise.aspx |title=Osamdesete: Velika generacija koja je mogla i više |last=Princivali |first=Ivan |date=11 February 2011 |work=dalmacijanews.com |language=Croatian |accessdate=7 May 2012}}</ref> By end of the Yugoslav era a young generation of future [[1998 World Cup]] bronze medalists started to play for the club.

In the wake of national tensions which would eventually lead to [[Yugoslav Wars]], during a tour in Australia, Hajduk restored its traditional emblem with the Croatian checkerboard, leaving out the red star, and sparking a massive crowd celebrations upon return. In September that same year a home game against Partizan would be cancelled in 73rd minute due to crowd entering the field and burning Yugoslav flag. Later, on 8 May 1991, Hajduk won the last held Yugoslav Cup final defeating that years [[1990–91 European Cup|European Champions]] Red Star in Belgrade with goal scored by Bokšić. Tito's trophy for Yugoslav Cup winners was therefore given to Hajduk and stayed in their permanent possession.<ref>[http://www.nogometni-magazin.com/newspro/coranto/viewnews.cgi?id=EkpkAElVlpQgfsQyWl&tmpl=coranto_hrv_news 97 people and events which mark Hajduk's history],{{dead link|date=March 2016}} Nogometni magazin</ref>

===Champions League and financial breakdown===
[[File:End of the match between Hajduk Split - Dinamo Zagreb.jpg|thumb|A Hajduk-[[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinam]]o match in Split]]

In the first four years of the [[Prva HNL|HNL]] (the Croatian football league), Hajduk became far more successful than rivals from [[Zagreb]], winning three League titles, two domestic Cups and two Supercups, with season [[1994–95 HNK Hajduk Split season|1994-95]] still standing as the most successful since playing in independent Croatia. As a crowning champion Hajduk entered that years [[1994-95 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] with a mix of young upcoming stars [[Milan Rapaić]], [[Ivica Mornar]], [[Tomislav Erceg]], [[Goran Vučević]] and experience former players like Igor Štimac, Zoran Vulić, Aljoša Asanović and [[Tonči Gabrić]] returning to assist them. After entering the group stage, Hajduk finished 2nd behind [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], ahead [[Steaua Bucharest|Steaua]] and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], before [[HNK Hajduk Split 0-0 AFC Ajax (1 March 1995)|facing]] and losing in quarterfinals to later European champions [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] (0-0, 0-3). At home the club won its first and last [[double (association football)|double crown]]. However, even tho the team was doing so well, the club was financially poorly managed, accumulating a massive financial loss that led to blocking of club's account.

For the next five years [[Hajduk Split]] stood in the shadow of wealthier and politically privileged rivals from Zagreb, and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] was no longer within reach. Between 1995 and 2000, not a single trophy was won. After continuous failure on domestic and international scene, fans began to seek the dismissal of administration officials, and circulated the story about the possible privatization of the club, which at that time did not happen. While their arch-rival Dinamo (then called "Croatia Zagreb") won titles, Hajduk had problems with the registration of players for the League. Dissatisfaction among the fans grew so much that some broke into the club premises, causing a change in leadership and promises of new beginnings. After death of the first Croatian president [[Franjo Tuđman]], whom many saw as heavily preferring and financing "Croatia", [[2000–01 Croatian First Football League|2001]] saw Hajduk become champions once more, after a memorable 4-2 win against [[NK Varteks (1958-2010)|Varteks]] in [[Varaždin]], game attended by far more Hajduk fans than locals. Unfortunately, financial conditions in the club were still dire, and the club was often on the precipice of bankruptcy and collapse.

And yet, even if operating with blocked account, chairman Branko Grgić boosted with promises of attractive signings and trophies. Although Hajduk did manage to win Cup in [[2002-03 Croatian Cup|2003]] and League titles in [[2003–04 Croatian First Football League|2004]] and [[2004–05 Croatian First Football League|2005]], as well as sign Dinamo's promising young captain [[Niko Kranjčar]] and their legendary manager [[Miroslav Blažević]], when finances and politically driven leadership finally broke down, so did the clubs results. Hajduk spent rest of the decade finishing behind its rival, with numerous coaching and management changes and reorganizations, players of dubious quality, and mediocre international performances, worst of which came after being eliminated by [[Shelbourne F.C.]] and 0-5 home loss to [[Debreceni VSC|Debrecen]]. Election of new chairman Mate Peroš in June 2008, upon which he changed the entire professional staff and reorganized the administration, brought only temporary relief. Hajduk achieved first away win against Dinamo after five and a half years (2-0) but again finished behind their arch-rivals, and reached [[2008-09 Croatian Cup|Croatian Cup]] finals only to lose to Dinamo once again in a two-game thriller which saw two 3-0 wins by both teams, before Dinamo winning 4-3 in penalty shootout. But the most important thing, state of club's finances, didn't radically change until next season when Hajduk became joint stock company owned by City of [[Split, Croatia|Split]]. Even if financially secure, newly appointed chairman [[Joško Svaguša]], continued the policy of expensive signings and unsustainable expenses to regain the club's former glory. In 2010 Hajduk won national [[2009-10 Croatian Cup|Cup]], its first trophy in five years, and later managed to qualify for the group stage of [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League]] which was the first time since 1994 club secured a place in the group stages of UEFA competitions. Home wins against [[Dinamo Bucharest]] (3-0), [[Unirea Urziceni]] (4-1) and [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] (1-0) were, however, just a temporary reminiscence of former successes.

Notable players of Hajduk's first 20 years in Croatia include goalkeepers [[Stipe Pletikosa]] and [[Tonči Gabrić]], defenders [[Igor Štimac]], [[Igor Tudor]] and [[Darijo Srna]], midfielders [[Milan Rapaić]], [[Ante Miše]], [[Nenad Pralija]], [[Dean Računica]], [[Josip Skoko]], [[Ivan Leko]], [[Srđan Andrić]] and [[Senijad Ibričić]] and strikers [[Ardian Kozniku]], [[Nikola Kalinić]] and [[Tomislav Erceg]].

On 13 February 2011, Hajduk commemorated its 100th birthday with a massive celebration in Split and all of Croatia with both Hajduk players and fans honouring the club. The entire city was decorated with Hajduk banners, flags, posters and paraphernalia, and there was a spectacular firework show over Split. Hajduk played a friendly game with [[Slavia Prague]] to honour its Czech origins, losing 0-2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultras-tifo.net/news/285-hajduk-split-100-years-celebration.html |title=Hajduk Split 100 years celebration |publisher=Ultras-tifo.net |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2013-11-29}}</ref>

===Our Hajduk===

All this time supporters led by Torcida led a struggle to end what they considered to be politically driven management of the club, and install experts to save Hajduk. In 2009 they started an initiative called "Dite puka" (People's Child) that should have prompted fans to buy up clubs shares and gain control of the club, which at the time didn't happen. In July 2011, however, inspired by examples in [[Bundesliga|Germany]] and [[Allsvenskan|Sweden]] and organized under the association "Naš Hajduk" (Our Hajduk), fans managed to gain rights of organizing elections for members of the club's supervisory board, making Hajduk only fan-owned football club in Croatian First League, and one of only two in former Yugoslavia (other being nearby [[HNK Trogir]]). In 2012 club fell into yet another financial trouble caused by former Hajduk presidents, leaving it with more than 100 million [[Croatian kuna|kuna]]s in debt, and one town meeting away of being bankrupt. After forming lines in front of the City Hall on 15 October 2012 fans convinced the town leaders to sign a loan insurance to the newly fan-elected chairman [[Marin Brbić]] and start the club's long needed financial recovery. Since then, according to the club's annual financial report, Hajduk is under continuous financial and managerial recovery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nogometplus.net/nogometplusnet/tekst/TabId/98/ArtMID/508/userid/238/ArticleID/5164/Kakav-je-bio-mandat-prvog-demokratski-izabranog-Nadzornog-odbora-u-Hajduku.aspx#.Vaptwvmqqko |title=Kakav je bio mandat prvog demokratski izabranog Nadzornog odbora u Hajduku |publisher=Nogometplus.hr |date=2015-07-18 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}</ref>

During present time domestic and international results are of secondary issue, as many consider [[Croatian Football Federation]] and entire league system to be under control of Dinamo's unofficial chairman Zdravko Mamić. Notable successes include 2-0 away win over [[Internazionale Milano|Inter Milan]], and [[2012–13 Croatian Football Cup|2013]] Croatian Cup.

==Stadium==
Hajduk's home ground is the [[Poljud stadium]]. It has 35,000 seats and is one of the two largest stadiums in [[Croatia]], designed by architect Boris Magaš, chosen among 20 other project in a 1975 competition. The stadium was built for the [[1979 Mediterranean Games]], but was also a venue for the [[1990 European Athletics Championships|1990 European Championships in athletics]] and the [[2010 IAAF Continental Cup]]. The stadium is affectionately known to the locals as the "Poljudska ljepotica" or "Poljud beauty". The largest crowd recorded was in 1980 at a match against [[Hamburg SV]] - 52,000 people. Two years later, after the stadium was fully completed its capacity was increased to 62,000 for a derby against [[Dinamo Zagreb]].

From 1911 to 1979 Hajduk played in a stadium called "[[Stadion Stari plac|Kod stare Plinare]]", used today by [[RK Nada]] rugby club. The stadium's first name was "Krajeva njiva", but after club moved to [[Poljud]], the old ground has become known in Split as the "Stari Plac" or "Staro Hajdukovo" (Old Hajduk's place). During the time stadium hosted a match between [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the [[UEFA Euro 1972 qualifying]] tournament. Hajduk supporters who would later reestablish the once forbidden name of [[Torcida Split|Torcida]], were situated in the east stands. 3,148 games were played on it, with 9,542 goals scored, 11 championships and six cups have been won.

Hajduk played its first game in a strip with red and white vertical stripes, which symbolized the Croatian coat of arms. The former Austrian City Council did not want to be seen as partisan and would not allow club colors to be made up from the emergent Croatian tricolour. Hajduk changed its kit design to red and blue vertical stripes with white 'Hajduk' written in the middle. 1914 saw the club choose a white shirt, blue shorts and socks; a combination that symbolizes white sails on a blue sea. The color white has since then become a symbol for the club, along with the nickname 'Bili' ('Whites').

Its away strip consists of red and blue shirts with vertical stripes (sometimes narrow, sometimes wide), blue shorts and socks, to symbolize the Croatian flag. From 2008-2011 the stripes were made horizontal. Although UEFA has not introduced compulsory registration of the third set of colours, one possibility was shirts of vertical red and white stripes, but were not adopted due to the resemblance of club colours of [[Red Star Belgrade|Red Star]]. Third set of colours was therefore often a combination of first two (most often completely white outfit), until a new gray design, composed of small triangular fan flags was introduced in 2015.

At one time the main colours were to be a combination of navy blue, white with blue horizontal stripes, but this kit was only sporadically worn by goalkeepers [[Stipe Pletikosa]] and [[Danijel Subašić]].

===Crest===
Hajduk's crest consists of the [[Coat of arms of Croatia|Croatian checkerboard]] with 25 red and white checkers bordered with a circle of blue ribbon, with two vertical lines on each side. The words ''Hajduk'' and ''Split'' are written above and below the checkerboard respectively. Symbolism of the white vertical lines is still discussed, with theories such as being a symbol of four founders, equals sign or quotation marks.

The modern crest is almost identical to the one created in 1911. The original was designed by one of club's founders Vjekoslav Ivanišević. It was then taken to Ana, the sister of the Kaliterna brothers who took a drawing of the crest to a convent where nuns manually created 20-30 pieces. The crest first appeared in public in 1926 during a performance of [[Ivo Tijardović|Tijardović]] opera ''Kraljica baluna'' as part of the scenery.

Hajduk didn't, however, wore the original crest before the war as it was not obligatory at the times. After club's rebirth following the end of WW2 the new crest became just a red star symbol. It was a symbol of anti-fascism which Hajduk stood up for during the 2nd World War. In 1960, a new crest was made, similar as the old one but with the red star in the middle instead of the former red and white traditional checkerboard. In 1990, while on tour in [[Australia]], the original crest was returned and has been used ever since.

==Supporters==
{{Main|Torcida Split}}
[[File:The Hajduk Split - Dinamo Zagreb derby.jpg|thumb|Torcida fans decorating the stands of [[Poljud]] stadium during the [[Eternal derby (Croatia)|Eternal Derby]].]]

Hajduk Split supporters, Torcida, were formed on 28 October 1950 by a group of students in Zagreb, namely Ante Dorić, Ante Ivanišević and Vjenceslav Žuvela, and are considered the oldest organized supporters group in Europe. They took their name from the Brazilian fan group they idolized, which comes from the Portuguese 'torcer' which means 'to cheer on'. "Hajduk lives forever" is their slogan.

Torcida members and other fervent fans gather in the north stand at the Poljud stadium from where they support their club. The '[[Heart of Hajduk Award|Heart of Hajduk]]' ({{lang-hr|Hajdučko srce}}) is an annual football prize which was established in 1994 and is officially awarded by the Hajduk Split supporters' to the team's best performing player during the season. It is awarded during the annual futsal competition Torcida Cup.
