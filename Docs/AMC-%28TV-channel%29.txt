'''AMC''' is an American [[cable television|basic cable]] and [[satellite television]] [[television channel|channel]] that is owned by [[AMC Networks]]. The channel primarily airs theatrically released [[film|movies]], along with a limited amount of original programming. The channel's name originally stood for "'''American Movie Classics'''", but since 2003 the full name has been de-emphasized as a result of a [[Channel drift|major shift]] in its [[Television program|programming]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gildemeister|first= Christopher|title=What Your Kids are Discovering on Discovery Channel|url= http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/culturewatch/2006/1016.asp |publisher=Parents Television Council|date=October 16, 2006|accessdate=January 22, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=When TV network changes name, look close|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/03/networkacronyms.ap/|work=CNN.com|agency=Associated Press|date=March 3, 2003|accessdate=May 31, 2008 |archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20080417043745/http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/03/03/networkacronyms.ap/ |archivedate = April 17, 2008}}</ref>

==History==

===1984–2002: Focus on classic films===
'''American Movie Classics''', as AMC was originally known, debuted on October 1, 1984 as a [[pay television|premium channel]]. Its original format focused on classic movies – largely those made prior to the 1950s – that aired during the afternoon and early evening hours in a [[television commercial|commercial]]-free, generally unedited, uncut and [[colorizing|uncolorized]] format.<ref name="fine arts hard to find">Gildemeister, Christopher. [http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/culturewatch/2006/1002.asp The Fine Arts Are Hard To Find]. [[Parents Television Council]], October 2, 2006.</ref> AMC was originally operated as a [[joint venture]] between [[Rainbow Media]] and cable television provider [[Tele-Communications Inc.]] ([[John Malone]], who owned TCI and its parent [[Liberty Media]], would launch another premium service [[Encore (TV network)|Encore]] – which also originally focused on older films, mainly from the 1960s to the 1980s – seven years later in April 1991). During its early years, it was not uncommon for AMC to host a marathon of [[Marx Brothers]] films, or show classics such as the original 1925 release of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. In 1987, the channel began to be carried on the [[Cable television in the United States|basic cable]] tiers of many cable providers.<ref name="fine arts hard to find"/><ref name="museum">Gomery, Douglas. [http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/americanmovi/americanmovi.htm American Movie Classics]. [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]]</ref> By 1989, AMC was available to 39 million subscribers in the U.S.<ref name="museum"/>

On December 1, 1990, AMC began operating on a 24-hour-a-day schedule. Beginning in 1993, AMC presented an annual Film Preservation Festival to raise awareness of and funding for [[film preservation]]. Coordinated with [[The Film Foundation]], an industry group that was founded by acclaimed director [[Martin Scorsese]], the festival was originally conceived as a multi-day [[marathon (television)|marathon]] presenting rare and previously [[lost film]]s, many airing for the first time on television, along with behind-the-scenes reports on the technical and monetary issues faced by those engaged in archival restoration. Portions of the festival were often dedicated to all-day marathons focusing on a single performer. During its fifth anniversary year in 1998, Scorsese credited the Festival for creating "not only a greater awareness, but ''[...]'' more of an expectation now to see restored films."<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1997/oct/02/entertainment/ca-38251 King, Susan (October 2, 1997), "Save That Movie! – After a slow start, AMC's Film Preservation Festival has raised $1.3 million", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Retrieved September 20, 2008.]</ref> In 1996, curator of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] Mary Lee Bandy called the Festival "the most important public event in support of film preservation."<ref name="query.nytimes.com">[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E7DB1339F933A05755C0A960958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all Van Gelder, Lawrence, (June 30, 1996) "Restoring Films to a Former Glory"], ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved September 20, 2008.</ref> By its tenth anniversary in 2003, the Festival had raised $2 million from the general public, which The Film Foundation divided among its five-member archives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/30/entertainment/et-elber30 |title=Elber, Lynn (2002-08-30), "Even 1970s Rock Fests Need Film Preservation" |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=August 29, 2003 |accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref>

In 1993, Cablevision's Rainbow Media division became the majority owner of the channel, when it bought out Liberty Media's 50% stake in AMC; incidentally in August of that year, Liberty announced its intent to purchase the 25% stake in the channel that Cablevision held at the time, with the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] helping to finance the buyout that included an option for TBS to eventually acquire AMC outright.<ref>[[John M. Higgins (journalist)|Higgins, John M.]], [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-14473791.html "Cablevision makes moves on AMC"], ''[[Multichannel News]]'', September 20, 1993.

Retrieved February 28, 2011 from HighBeam Research.</ref> The following year, [[Time Warner]] (which would later purchase rival [[Turner Classic Movies]] following the company's 1996 acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System) also attempted to acquire at least part of Liberty Media's stake in AMC.<ref>[[John M.

Retrieved February 28, 2011 from HighBeam Research.</ref>

In June 1995, AMC filed a $550 million [[breach of contract]] lawsuit against [[Turner Entertainment]], which alleged that the company violated AMC's exclusive cable television rights to the pre-1950 [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] film library to broadcast approximately 30 times between July 1994 and April 1995, charging that Turner's objective in violating the contract was "to gain unfair advantage for the Turner Classic Movies cable network (which debuted in April 1994) at the expense of AMC."; Turner owns rights to the [[RKO Radio Pictures]] film library and licensed RKO's films to AMC in an output deal that was slated to last through 2004. Under the terms of the deal, AMC would obtain the RKO titles in exclusive windows.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-17277280.html Katz, Richard.

Around this time, [[General Electric]]/[[NBC]] owned a stake in AMC – which it divested in the early 2000s. From 1996 to 1998, AMC aired its first original series, ''[[Remember WENN]]'', a half-hour scripted series about a radio station during the peak of radio's influence in the 1930s. The show was well received by both critics and its enthusiastic fans, but was abruptly cancelled after its fourth season following management changes at the channel (WENN was followed up by ''[[The Lot]]'', which lasted for only 16 episodes). Despite a well publicized write-in campaign to save the series, the show was not renewed for its originally scheduled fifth season.

[[File:AMC logo 1999.png|150px|left|thumb|AMC logo shown from 1998 to 2002.]]
One popular AMC program was ''American Pop!'' (originally intended as a preview of a new 24-hour cable channel),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4789318-1.html |title="AMC Ushering In Nostalgic American Pop" (1998-06-20), ''Hollywood Reporter''. Retrieved on 2008-9-20 via |publisher=Allbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref> which ran from 1998 to 2003 and featured movies from the 1950s and 1960s aimed at [[baby boomers]] (such as ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' and ''[[Ski Party]]''). Of particular interest to movie completists were the segments that AMC played to fill out the timeslot (Saturday nights from 10:00&nbsp;p.m. to 12:00&nbsp;a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]): classic [[film trailer|movie trailers]], [[drive-in]] movie ads and [[Snipe (theatrical)|snipes]] (bits extolling viewers to visit the snack bar, etc.), along with [[music videos]] cribbed from movie musicals from the period.

The majority of the films presented on AMC during the 1990s had originally been released by [[Paramount Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Columbia Pictures]], and [[Universal Studios]]. The channel also occasionally showed classic [[silent film]]s. The regular hosts of the telecasts were [[Bob Dorian]] and later, [[Nick Clooney]], as well as [[New York City]] radio personality Gene Klavan from WNEW (1130 AM, now [[WBBR]]). Another WNEW-AM alum, [[Al "Jazzbo" Collins]], provided his voice for the "Jazzbo's Swingin' Soundies" series of [[interstitial programming|interstitials]].

For most of its first 18 years in existence, AMC provided uncut and uncolorized films without commercial interruption. Its revenue came from carriage fees provided by the cable providers that maintained carriage agreements with the channel. However, in 1998, AMC began accepting traditional advertising, incorporating limited commercial interruptions between films (its sister movie channel [[Romance Classics]], which had launched only one year earlier, became an entirely ad-supported channel at that point).<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19429076.html AMC on sponsorships: 'roll 'em!'], ''[[Multichannel News]]'' (via [[HighBeam Research]]), March 24, 1997.</ref> By 2001, AMC had also incorporated commercial breaks during its movie telecasts.<ref>Battaglio, Stephen. It now has enough commercials to make movie watching almost as intolerable as any other commercial channel.[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2003/06/27/2003-06-27_old-movie_channels_nearing_s.html "Old-Movie Channels Nearing Showdown".] ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''. June 27, 2003.</ref> As a result of this move, Turner Classic Movies became the only one of the two classic film-focused networks to present their films commercial-free.

===2002–09: Format change and expansion into original programming===
[[File:Amc logo.svg|150px|right|thumb|AMC logo, used from 2002 to 2013.]]
On September 30, 2002, AMC underwent a significant rebranding, changing its format from a classic movie channel, broadening to a more general focus on movies from all eras<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110809174330/http://www.amctv.com/faq#q10 Why did AMC change its format?] From the AMCtv.com FAQ</ref> – as well as shortening its name to just the "AMC" abbreviation, and introducing a new logo (a rectangular outline with a lower-case "amc" text). Kate McEnroe, then-president of Rainbow Media, cited lack of subsidies from cable providers as the reason for the addition of advertising, and cited ad agencies who insist on programming relevant to their products' consumers as the reason for the shift to recent movies instead of just classics.<ref name="welcometosilentmovies.com">Dempsey, John. [http://www.welcometosilentmovies.com/news/newsarchive/amc.htm "AMC Unveils More Contemporary Slate, Extra Ads"]. ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. May 12, 2003.</ref> At the time of the format switchover, the company also attempted to launch a spin-off [[digital cable]] channel, AMC's Hollywood Classics, which would have required viewers to pay an extra fee to receive the channel. This commercial-free channel would have aired black-and-white classics from the 1930s through the 1950s that American Movie Classics had been airing up until its format changeover; however, the new channel never debuted.<ref name="welcometosilentmovies.com"/><ref>Battaglio, Stephen.

June 28, 2002.</ref>

The network also gradually brought back original programming. In 2004, AMC aired its first [[reality television|reality series]], ''FilmFakers''; the show featured out-of-work actors who believed they were auditioning for a major role in a real movie, only to be told that they were the subject of a prank and no film actually existed. A ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article on the show said that "''FilmFakers'' may go down as one of the meanest reality series yet."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/26/arts/television/26fake.html?_r=1&ex=1256529600&en=63ed372d8a3775a1&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland | work=The New York Times | title=Quiet on the Fake Set; Cue the Unsuspecting Actor | first=Lola | last=Ogunnaike | date=October 26, 2004 | accessdate=April 23, 2010}}</ref> From 2002 to 2007, AMC had showed classic films and documentaries about film history such as ''Backstory'' and ''Movies that Shook the World''.

In late 2007 the network debuted its first original drama series ''[[Mad Men]]'', a [[period piece]] about [[Madison Avenue]] [[advertising]] executives in the 1960s. The show was immediately lauded by critics,<ref name="Stanley">{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/19/arts/television/19stan.html?em&ex=1184990400&en=321917a96ed3bbf9&ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | title=Smoking, Drinking, Cheating and Selling | first=Alessandra | last=Stanley | date=July 18, 2006 | accessdate=December 16, 2010}}</ref> and has won 16 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/mad-men |title=Mad Men — Television Academy |author =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Television Academy |publisher= |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Peabody Award]].<ref>[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/mad-men 67th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2008.</ref> ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', a drama about a [[cancer]]-stricken chemistry teacher involved in making and dealing [[methamphetamine]] (played by [[Bryan Cranston]], who had been known primarily for comedic roles in series such as ''[[Malcolm in the Middle]]'' prior to the series), premiered in 2008; also garnering critical acclaim, winning 16 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/shows/breaking-bad |title=Breaking Bad — Television Academy |author =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Television Academy |publisher= |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}</ref> and is regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Daisy |date=18 May 2014 |title=TV Baftas 2014: Breaking Bad wins Best International series |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/tv-baftas-2014-breaking-bad-beats-borgen-and-house-of-cards-to-win-best-international-series-9392903.html |newspaper=The Independent |accessdate=28 May 2014 }}</ref> ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Mad Men'' ended their runs in 2013 and 2015, respectively, with the former receiving a spin-off in the form of ''[[Better Call Saul]]''. Both shows combined have won a total of 32 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, 6 [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and 5 [[Screen Actors Guild Award]]s.

===2009–13: "Story Matters Here"===
On May 31, 2009, during the second season finale of ''Breaking Bad'', AMC rebranded with the introduction of a new slogan, "Story Matters Here".<ref name=somethingmore>{{cite web|title=AMC Introduces ''Story Matters Here''|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2009/03/31/amc-introduces-story-matters-here-30868/20090331amc01/|publisher=The Futon Critic|accessdate=15 August 2013}}</ref> Later that year, the network premiered its second miniseries, ''[[The Prisoner (2009 miniseries)|The Prisoner]]''. On January 4, 2010, AMC began airing [[infomercial]]s on Monday through Saturday mornings from 6:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time; the Saturday morning infomercial block was eliminated after its March 25, 2011, airing as AMC added a Saturday block of [[western (genre)|western]] series and films the following week. 2010 also saw the premieres of ''[[Rubicon (TV series)|Rubicon]]'' and ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]''. While ''Rubicon'' was cancelled, ''The Walking Dead'' became an enormous success and has become the most watched scripted program in basic cable history.

In 2011, [[Cablevision]] [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] Rainbow Media into a separate company, which was renamed AMC Networks, after its flagship cable network. Cablevision founder [[Charles Dolan]] and his family continue to retain a controlling interest in the company.<ref>[http://www.deadline.com/2011/06/amc-networks-goes-public-with-hot-shows-and-analysts-looking-for-a-sale AMC Networks Goes Public With Hot Shows, And Analysts Looking For A Sale] ''Deadline New York'' July 1, 2011</ref> Also during this year, the network introduced two new dramas (''[[The Killing (U.S. TV series)|The Killing]]'' and ''[[Hell on Wheels (TV series)|Hell on Wheels]]''), two original web series (''[[The Trivial Pursuits of Arthur Banks]]''<ref>[http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2011/07/the-trivial-pursuits-of-arthur-banks.php#more AMC Launches AMC Digital Studios With The Trivial Pursuits of Arthur Banks on Aug. 22]</ref> and ''[[The Walking Dead: Torn Apart]]''), and the ''Walking Dead'' discussion series ''[[Talking Dead]]''. In 2012, AMC premiered three original reality series: ''[[The Pitch (TV series)|The Pitch]]'', ''[[Comic Book Men]]''<ref name=secret>[http://www.multichannel.com/article/473160-AMC_Greenlights_Two_Unscripted_Series.php AMC Greenlights Two Unscripted Series] ''Multichannel News'' September 1, 2011,</ref> and ''[[Small Town Security]]''; along with a second web series spun off from ''The Walking Dead'', ''[[The Walking Dead: Cold Storage]]''.<ref name=secret/>

===2013–present: "Something More"===
On March 31, 2013, during the third-season finale of ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', AMC unveiled a rebranding campaign with the new slogan "''Something More''", and inverted the logo from a rectangular outlined box to a solid gold block with the network's acronymic name retained in the center.<ref>{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|title=AMC Rebrands With New Logo, Tagline|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/amc-rebrands-new-logo-tagline-431997|accessdate=1 April 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=1 April 2013}}</ref> 2013 saw the channel's unscripted slate double with the additions of the unscripted series ''[[Freakshow (TV series)|Freakshow]]'', ''Immortalized'', ''[[Owner's Manual (TV series)|Owner's Manual]]'' and ''Showville'', and the ''Breaking Bad'' discussion series ''[[Breaking Bad (season 5)#Talking Bad|Talking Bad]]''.

Also in April, ''[[Rectify]]'', which was originally developed for AMC, premiered on AMC's sister channel [[SundanceTV|Sundance Channel]] to jump-start that network's emerging slate of original scripted programming. It was then followed by the July announcement that fellow sister channel [[WE tv]] had picked up another series originally developed for AMC for the 2012-13 development slate, ''[[The Divide (TV series)|The Divide]]'', to series. During this timeframe, AMC had started to run marathons of certain shows and cross-promote programs from its co-owned sister channels.

In July 2013, the network announced that it had given series orders for two dramas: ''[[Turn: Washington's Spies]]'' (which premiered on April 6, 2014) and ''[[Halt and Catch Fire (TV series)|Halt and Catch Fire]]'' (which premiered on June 1, 2014). This marked the first time that AMC had four pilot orders picked up to series in the same cycle, the other two being ''The Divide'' and ''Low Winter Sun'' (the latter premiered on August 11, 2013, after the season premiere of the final season of ''Breaking Bad''). The former two would both be renewed for second seasons while the latter two were cancelled after their first seasons. AMC would then pick up ''[[Into the Badlands (TV series)|Into the Badlands]]'' up for a six episode first season<ref name="Badlands">{{cite web|title=AMC Orders Martial Arts Drama 'Badlands' Straight to Series|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/amc-orders-martial-arts-drama-718121|first=Lesley|last=Goldberg|date=July 11, 2014|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> and ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' spinoff ''[[Better Call Saul]]'' for two seasons.

====Shift away from unscripted programming====

On October 9, 2014, it was announced that AMC would scrap its entire current and future unscripted slate outside of ''The Talking Dead'' and ''Comic Book Men''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=AMC Abandons Unscripted Programming To Focus On Scripted Series, ‘Talking Dead’ & ‘Comic Book Men’ To Continue|url=http://deadline.com/2014/10/amc-unscripted-programming-scripted-series-talking-dead-comic-book-men-849024/|website=Deadline|publisher=Deadline|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> This announcement came shortly after AMC took over the [[United States]] co-production of the sci-fi drama ''Humans'' from [[Xbox Entertainment Studios]].<ref name="humans">{{cite web|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|title=It’s Official: AMC Picks Up Channel 4 Series ‘Humans’|url=http://deadline.com/2014/09/humans-amc-channel-4-838483/|website=Deadline|accessdate=10 October 2014}}</ref> AMC Media recently bought the European media giant Chello Media from [[Liberty Global]].

==Programming==

===Movie library===
AMC maintains movie licensing rights agreements with [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]], [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (including films from [[United Artists]] and library content from [[The Samuel Goldwyn Company]], [[Orion Pictures]], and [[Cannon Group]]), [[Universal Studios]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] (primarily film content from [[Touchstone Pictures]]) and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] (including [[Columbia Pictures]], [[TriStar Pictures]], [[Sony Pictures Classics]], [[Screen Gems]], and [[Triumph Films]]). Since the 2003 format change, the network's film telecasts usually are "television" cuts meant for basic cable, which feature content edits, dubbing of [[profanity|profanities]] and some time edits by removing some superfluous plotting or toning down scenes with adult content inappropriate for basic cable broadcast to fit within a set timeslot with commercials added.

====FearFest====
In 1997, AMC launched Monsterfest, a popular week-long marathon of [[horror movie]]s and thrillers that aired in late October. In the mid-2000s, AMC started a Monsterfest blog on its website,<ref>{{cite web|author =AMCtv.com on Apr 6, 2010 |url=http://amctv.typepad.com/monsterfest/ |title=AMC TV: Monsterfest |publisher=Amctv.typepad.com |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=June 4, 2011}}</ref> which chronicled news on horror-related film and television productions. In addition, AMC presented "Fear Friday," a horror movie [[double feature]] on late Friday evenings. On September 26, 2008, AMC announced the launch of a new horror-themed movie marathon for its October schedule called "Fearfest" (which replaced Monsterfest); coinciding with this, the "Monsterfest" blog was renamed as the "Horror Hacker" blog.

===Series programming===
Although movies remain an integral part of AMC's schedule, the network has garnered attention in recent years for its original series. The channel's first original series was ''[[The Movie Masters]]'', which ran from 1989 to 1990; outside of ''Remember WENN'' and ''Filmfakers'', most of AMC's original programming prior to September 2007 consisted of film history-related documentary and review programs. The establishment of ''Mad Men'' in 2007, followed by that of ''Breaking Bad'' in 2008, has given AMC a reputation on par with premium cable networks [[HBO]] and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]], both of which rejected ''Mad Men'' before it came to AMC.<ref name="Stanley"/> The channel also airs some [[broadcast syndication|acquired programs]] such as ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[The Rifleman]]'' and shorts from [[The Three Stooges]]. Series programming, however, continues to occupy a limited portion of AMC's schedule.
