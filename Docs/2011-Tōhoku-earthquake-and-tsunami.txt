The source area of this earthquake has a relatively high coupling coefficient surrounded by areas of relatively low coupling coefficients in the west, north, and south. From the averaged coupling coefficient of 0.5&ndash;0.8 in the source area and the seismic moment, it was estimated that the slip deficit of this earthquake was accumulated over a period of 260&ndash;880 years, which is consistent with the recurrence interval of such great earthquakes estimated from the tsunami deposit data. The seismic moment of this earthquake accounts for about 93% of the estimated cumulative moment from 1926 to March 2011. Hence, earthquakes with magnitudes about 7 since 1926 in this area only had released part of the accumulated energy. In the area near the trench, the coupling coefficient is high, which could act as the source of the large tsunami.<ref>[http://www.aob.geophys.tohoku.ac.jp/download/ronbun/EPS_uchida2011.pdf ] {{wayback|url=http://www.aob.geophys.tohoku.ac.jp/download/ronbun/EPS_uchida2011.pdf |date=20111207195402 |df=y }}</ref>

The first sign international researchers had that the earthquake caused such a dramatic change in the Earth’s rotation came from the United States Geological Survey which monitors Global Positioning Satellite stations across the world. The Survey team had several GPS monitors located near the scene of the earthquake. The GPS station located nearest the epicenter moved almost {{convert|4|m|abbr=on}}. This motivated government researchers to look into other ways the earthquake may have had large scale effects on the planet.  Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory did some calculations and determined that the Earth's rotation was changed by the earthquake to the point where the days are now 1.8 [[microsecond]]s shorter.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Richard |date=19 March 2011 |title=Japan Earthquake May Have Shifted Earth’s Axis |publisher=NPR online |url=http://www.npr.org/2011/03/18/134658880/Japan-Earthquake-May-Have-Changed-Earths-Axis}}</ref>

The earthquake took place at 14:46 JST (UTC 05:46) around 67&nbsp;km (42&nbsp;mi) from the nearest point on Japan's coastline, and initial estimates indicated the tsunami would have taken 10 to 30&nbsp;minutes to reach the areas first affected, and then areas farther north and south based on the geography of the coastline.<ref>One estimate of 10–15&nbsp;minutes came from German seismologist Rainer Kind of the Helmholtz Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam, as interviewed in [http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,14904863,00.html Japan's tsunami victims only had 15&nbsp;minutes warning], ''[[Deutsche Welle]]'', 12 March 2011.

Among several factors causing the high death toll from the tsunami, one was the unexpectedly large size of the water surge. The tsunami walls at several of the affected cities were based on much smaller tsunami heights. Also, many people caught in the tsunami thought that they were located on high enough ground to be safe.<ref>Watts, Jonathan, "Quake survivors search for hope and shelter", ''Japan Times'', 26 March 2011, p. 13.</ref>

Tōhoku Electric Power was not able to provide the Kanto region with additional power, because TEP's power plants were also damaged in the earthquake. [[Kansai Electric Power Company]] (Kepco) cannot share electricity, because its system operates at 60 hertz, whereas TEPCO and TEP operate their systems at 50 hertz; this is due to early industrial and infrastructure development in the 1880s that left Japan without a unified national [[power grid]].<ref>[http://www.itworld.com/business/140626/legacy-1800s-leaves-tokyo-facing-blackouts A legacy from the 1800s leaves Tokyo facing blackouts], ITworld, 18 March 2011 {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5y2ayU8pa|date=18 April 2011}}</ref> Two substations, one in Shizuoka Prefecture and one in Nagano Prefecture, were able to convert between frequencies and transfer electricity from Kansai to Kanto and Tōhoku, but their capacity to do so is limited to 1 GW.

The rolling blackouts brought on by the crises at the nuclear power plants in Fukushima had a profound effect on the rail networks around Tokyo starting on 14 March. Major railways began running trains at 10–20&nbsp;minute intervals, rather than the usual 3–5&nbsp;minute intervals, operating some lines only at rush hour and completely shutting down others; notably, the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]], [[Yokosuka Line]], [[Sōbu Main Line]] and [[Chūō-Sōbu Line]] were all stopped for the day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/national/update/0314/TKY201103130323.html |title=asahi.com（朝日新聞社）：計画停電で影響が出る主な鉄道（午前７時現在） – 社会 |work=Asahi Shimbun |location=Japan|accessdate=14 March 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5y2b5j7jT | archivedate=18 April 2011| deadurl=no}}</ref> This led to near-paralysis within the capital, with long lines at train stations and many people unable to come to work or get home. Railway operators gradually increased capacity over the next few days, until running at approximately 80% capacity by 17 March and relieving the worst of the passenger congestion.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Rescued from Tsunami at Ishinomaki.JPG|thumb|upright|Rescue operations in the floodwaters in downtown [[Ishinomaki]]]]
<!-- (This is a summary only – see main article for supporting references.) -->{{Main|Aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami}}

The aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami included both a humanitarian crisis and a major economic impact. The tsunami resulted in over 340,000 displaced people in the Tōhoku region, and shortages of food, water, shelter, medicine and fuel for survivors. In response the Japanese government mobilized the Self-Defence Forces (under Joint Task Force - Tohoku, led by Lieutenant General [[Eiji Kimizuka]]), while many countries sent search and rescue teams to help search for survivors. Aid organizations both in Japan and worldwide also responded, with the Japanese Red Cross reporting $1&nbsp;billion in donations. The economic impact included both immediate problems, with industrial production suspended in many factories, and the longer term issue of the cost of rebuilding which has been estimated at ¥10&nbsp;trillion ($122&nbsp;billion). In comparison to the [[1995 Great Hanshin earthquake]], the East Japan earthquake brought serious damage to an extremely wide range.<ref>{{cite book | title=East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami: Evacuation, Communication, Education and Volunteerism | publisher=Research Publishing Services |author1=Rajib Shaw  |author2=Yukiko Takeuchi | year=2012 | location=Singapore | page=288 | isbn=978-981-07-0186-4}}</ref>

The aftermath of the twin disasters also left Japan's coastal cities and towns with nearly 25 million tons of debris. In Ishinomaki alone, there were 17 trash collection sites 180 metres long and at least 4.5 metres high. An official in the city's government trash disposal department estimated that it would take three years to empty these sites.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Japan tackles mountains of trash | publisher=Christian Science Monitor | author=Peter Ford | date=July 18, 2011 | page=12 | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2011/0715/Japan-tackles-mountains-of-trash-left-in-tsunami-s-wake}}</ref>

In April 2015, authorities off the coast of Oregon discovered debris that is thought to be from a boat destroyed during the tsunami. Cargo contained yellowtail jack fish, a species that lives off the coast of Japan, still alive. KGW estimates that more than 1 million tons of debris still remain in the Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Mejia|first1=Paula|title=Piece of Ship from Japan’s 2011 Tsunami Surfaces in Oregon|url=http://www.newsweek.com/piece-ship-japans-2011-tsunami-surfaces-oregon-321793|website=Newsweek|accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref>

According to [[Jake Adelstein]], most Japanese media accepted and parroted the misinformation put out by the Japanese government and TEPCO about the unfolding Fukushima nuclear crisis. Notable exceptions, according to Adelstein, were newspapers ''[[Sankei Shimbun]]'' and ''[[Chunichi Shimbun]]'' which questioned the accuracy of the information coming from the government and TEPCO. Because of the unquestioning nature of most Japanese media to hold to the "party line", many Japanese mid-level officials and experts spoke to foreign media to get their opinions and observations publicized.<ref>[[Jake Adelstein|Adelstein, Jake]], "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/01/01/national/what-2011-means-for-japan-in-2012-and-beyond/ What 2011 means for Japan in 2012 and beyond]," ''[[Japan Times]]'', 1 January 2012, p. 20.</ref>

[[Atsushi Funahashi]], director of ''Nuclear Nation'' notes that "when the overseas media was calling Fukushima a '[[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]],' the Japanese government and media waited two months before admitting it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/culture/2014/03/japans-radioactive-nightmare.html|title=JAPAN’S RADIOACTIVE NIGHTMARE|publisher=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>

Nine days after the earthquake hit, a [[Scientific visualization|visualization]] and [[sonification]] were uploaded to [[YouTube]] allowing listeners to hear the earthquake as it unfolded in time. Two days of seismic activity made available by the [[IRIS Consortium]] were compressed into two minutes of sound. The large number of views made the video one of the most popular examples of sonification on the web.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PJxUPvz9Oo|title=Sonification of the Tohoku Earthquake}}</ref>

The quake gave scientists the opportunity to collect a large amount of data so as to model in great detail the seismic events that took place.<ref name="DW" /> This data is expected to be used in a variety of ways, providing as it does unprecedented information about how buildings respond to shaking, and other effects.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-sci-japan-quake-science-20110313,0,5782113.story|title=Japan earthquake shifted Earth on its axis|last=Brown|first=Eryn|date=12 March 2011|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=13 March 2011|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x96cBq8d|archivedate=13 March 2011}}</ref>
