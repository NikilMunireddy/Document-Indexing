==History==

===Formation (1964–1971)===
In 1964, [[Steven Tyler]] formed his own band called the Strangeurs—later Chain Reaction—in [[New Hampshire]]. Meanwhile, Perry and Hamilton formed the Jam Band (commonly known as "Joe Perry's Jam Band"), which was based on free-form and blues. Hamilton and Perry moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in September 1969.<ref>Davis, p. 95</ref> There they met [[Joey Kramer]], a drummer from [[Yonkers, New York]]. Kramer knew Tyler and had always hoped to play in a band with him.<ref name="Walk This Way, page 104">Davis, p. 104</ref> Kramer, a [[Berklee College of Music]] student, decided to quit school to join Jam Band.<ref name="Walk This Way, page 104"/>

In 1970, Chain Reaction and Jam Band played at the same gig. Tyler immediately loved Jam Band's sound, and wanted to combine the two bands. In October 1970, the bands met up again and considered the proposition. Tyler, who had been a drummer and backup singer in Chain Reaction, adamantly refused to play drums in this new band, insisting he would only take part if he could be frontman and lead vocalist. The others agreed, and a new band was born. The band moved into a home together at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in [[Boston]], where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between shows.<ref name="Walk This Way, page 104"/>

The members of the band reportedly spent afternoons getting stoned and watching ''[[Three Stooges]]'' reruns. One day, they had a post-Stooges meeting to try to come up with a name. Kramer said when he was in school he would write the word aerosmith all over his notebooks.<ref name="Davis, pp. 106–107"/> The name had popped into his head after listening to [[Harry Nilsson]]'s album ''[[Aerial Ballet]]'', which featured jacket art of a circus performer jumping out of a biplane. Initially, Kramer's bandmates were unimpressed; they all thought he was referring to [[Arrowsmith (novel)|the Sinclair Lewis novel]] they were required to read in high school English class. "No, not Arrowsmith," Kramer explained. "A-E-R-O...Aerosmith."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aeronewsdaily.com/blog/2008/03/14/steven-tyler-interview|title=Interview with Steven Tyler|publisher=AeroNewsDaily|date=March 13, 2008|accessdate=August 27, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514055305/http://aeronewsdaily.com/blog/2008/03/14/steven-tyler-interview|archivedate=May 14, 2008}}</ref> The band settled upon this name after also considering "the Hookers" and "Spike Jones."<ref name="Davis, pp. 106–107">Davis, pp. 106–107</ref><ref name="mtv">{{cite web|title=The Aerosmith History 1969–2002|work=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/timeline.jhtml|accessdate=March 25, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317194349/http://www.mtv.com/onair/icon/timeline.jhtml| archivedate=March 17, 2008| deadurl=no}}</ref>

Soon, the band hired [[Ray Tabano]], a childhood friend of Tyler, as rhythm guitarist and began playing local shows.<ref>Davis, pp. 105, 111</ref> Aerosmith played their first gig in [[Mendon, Massachusetts]] at [[Nipmuc Regional High School]] (now Miscoe Hill Middle School) on November 6, 1970. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by [[Brad Whitford]], who also attended the Berklee School of Music and was formerly of the band [[Earth Inc.]]<ref>Davis, pp. 128–131</ref> Whitford, from [[Reading, Massachusetts]], had already played at Reading's [[Coolidge Middle School (Reading, Massachusetts)|AW Coolidge Middle School]]. Other than a period from July 1979 to April 1984, the line-up of Tyler, Perry, Hamilton, Kramer, and Whitford has stayed the same.<ref name="allmusic"/>

After forming the band and finalizing the lineup in 1971, the band started to garner some local success doing live shows.<ref name="Aerosmith: Biography: Rolling Stone"/> Originally booked through the Ed Malhoit Agency,<ref>Davis, p. 110</ref> the band signed a promotion deal with Frank Connelly and eventually secured a management deal with David Krebs and Steve Leber in 1972.<ref>Davis, p. 157</ref> Krebs and Leber invited [[Columbia Records]] President [[Clive Davis]] to see the band at [[Max's Kansas City]] in New York City. Aerosmith was not originally scheduled to play that night at the club, but they paid from their own pockets to secure a place on the bill, reportedly the only band ever to do so at Max's.

===Departures of Perry and Whitford, ''Night in the Ruts'' and ''Rock in a Hard Place'' (1979–1984)===
In 1979, the band started work on their next album, ''[[Night in the Ruts]]''. Aerosmith decided to go on tour during a break in the recording schedule but tensions within the band were slowly coming to a head. The band's touring schedule brought them to [[Cleveland Stadium]] on July 28, 1979, where they headlined the [[World Series of Rock]] festival. In a heated argument backstage, Joe Perry's wife, Elissa, threw a glass of milk at Tom Hamilton's wife, Terry. Following the show, Tyler and Perry got into a heated argument when Tyler confronted Perry about his wife's antics, and after the course of the argument Perry quit the band and left (while Tyler claims in his autobiography that he fired Perry from the band). In leaving, Perry took some of the music that he had written with him. Shortly after his departure Perry formed a new band called [[the Joe Perry Project]].<ref name="allmusic"/><ref name="Aerosmith: Biography: Rolling Stone"/>

Since there was still work to be done on ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith needed fill-in musicians to take Perry's place on the songs that needed to be recorded to complete the album. Rhythm guitarist Brad Whitford took over some of the lead parts and [[Richard Supa|Richie Supa]], the band's longtime writing partner, filled in where needed until the band was able to hire [[Jimmy Crespo]] to take over as the full-time guitarist. ''Night in the Ruts'' was released in November 1979, but only managed to sell enough records to be certified Gold at the time (it would eventually sell enough to be Platinum certified in 1994). The only single the album spawned, a cover of "[[Remember (Walking in the Sand)]]" by the Shangri-Las, peaked at #67 on the Billboard Hot 100.<ref name="Aerosmith Chart Positions"/>

The tour for ''Night in the Ruts'' commenced shortly thereafter but the band found themselves playing in smaller and smaller venues than they were before due to their popularity beginning to wane. Steven Tyler's drug issues were starting to affect his performance and songwriting, and he reached bottom when he collapsed on stage during a show in [[Portland, Maine]] in 1980 and did not get up for the remainder of the set.<ref>Davis, p. 371</ref> Also in 1980, Aerosmith released its ''[[Greatest Hits (Aerosmith album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album. While the compilation didn't chart very high initially, it gained popularity later and has gone on to become the band's bestselling album in the United States, with sales of 11 million copies.<ref name="RIAA&nbsp;— Searchable Database"/> In the fall of 1980, Tyler was injured in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him hospitalized for two months, and unable to tour or record well into 1981.<ref>Davis, pp. 373–374</ref>

In 1981, Aerosmith began work on their next album, which was titled ''[[Rock in a Hard Place]]'' and saw them reunite with producer Jack Douglas. Once again, though, they would be forced to deal with another departure. After the first song for the album, "[[Lightning Strikes (Aerosmith song)|Lightning Strikes]]", was recorded Brad Whitford departed the band and decided to form a duo with [[Derek St. Holmes]], with whom he recorded a [[Whitford/St. Holmes|self-titled album]] that failed to garner much interest. Whitford later joined up with the Joe Perry Project and played with them in 1984.<ref>Davis, p. 378</ref>

With [[Rick Dufay]] taking Whitford's place, ''Rock in a Hard Place'' was released on August 1, 1982. The album reached #32 on the Billboard 200 album chart.<ref name="RIAA&nbsp;— Searchable Database"/> Only one single charted, the aforementioned "Lightning Strikes", which peaked at number 21 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Top Tracks]] chart.<ref name="Aerosmith Chart Positions"/> As with the tour for ''Night in the Ruts'', Aerosmith was unable to book larger venues and instead had to rely on filling clubs and theaters, which they struggled to do. At a show in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], Tyler and Perry reunited and got high backstage before the show. Tyler was so intoxicated that he collapsed on stage again and, like before, could not get up.<ref>Davis, p. 400</ref>

On February 14, 1984, Perry and Whitford saw Aerosmith perform at Boston's [[Orpheum Theatre (Boston)|Orpheum Theater]]. Shortly thereafter, discussions began to reintegrate the two into the band and several months later, the original members of Aerosmith reunited.<ref>Davis, p. 417</ref> Steven Tyler recalls:{{cquote|You should have felt the buzz the moment all five of us got together in the same room for the first time again. We all started laughin'—it was like the five years had never passed. We knew we'd made the right move.|4=Steven Tyler|5=<ref>Huxley, p. 128</ref>}}

===Back in the Saddle reunion tour, ''Done with Mirrors'' and drug rehab (1984–1986)===
In 1984, Aerosmith embarked on a reunion tour called the [[Back in the Saddle Tour]],<ref name="allmusic"/> which led to the live album ''[[Classics Live II]]''. While concerts on the tour were well-attended, it was plagued with several incidents, mostly attributed to drug abuse by band members.<ref name="allmusic"/> Their problems still not behind them, the group was signed to [[Geffen Records]] and began working on a comeback.<ref name="Biography.com"/> Despite the band signing on to a new record company, the band's old label [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] continued to reap the benefits of Aerosmith's comeback, releasing the live companion albums ''[[Classics Live I and II]]'' and the collection ''[[Gems (Aerosmith album)|Gems]]''.<ref>{{cite web| title = Allmusic&nbsp;– ''Gems''&nbsp;– Review | author = Greg Prato | publisher = Allmusic | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r181|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate=April 2, 2008}}</ref>

In 1985, the band released the album ''[[Done with Mirrors]]'', their first studio album since reuniting. While the album did receive some positive reviews,<ref>{{cite web| title = Allmusic&nbsp;– ''Done with Mirrors''&nbsp;– Review | author = Stephen Thomas Erlewine | publisher = Allmusic | url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r177|pure_url=yes}} | accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> it only went gold<ref name="RIAA&nbsp;— Searchable Database"/> and failed to produce a hit single or generate any widespread interest.<ref name="Aerosmith Chart Positions"/> The album's most notable track, "[[Let the Music Do the Talking (song)|Let the Music Do the Talking]]", was in fact a cover of a song originally recorded by the Joe Perry Project and released on that band's album of the same name.<ref>{{cite web| title = Done With Mirrors: Aerosmith: Review: Rolling Stone | author = Jimmy Guterman |work=Rolling Stone | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/172146/review/5945804 | accessdate=April 1, 2008}}</ref> Nevertheless, the band became a popular concert attraction once again, [[Done with Mirrors Tour|touring in support of ''Done With Mirrors'']], well into 1986.<ref>{{cite web| title = Aerosmith&nbsp;— Done With Mirrors Tour | publisher = [[Aero Force One]] | url=http://www.aeroforceone.com/index.cfm?pid=804189 | accessdate=April 1, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080420102217/http://www.aeroforceone.com/index.cfm?pid=804189| archivedate= 20 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In 1986, Tyler and Perry appeared on [[Run–D.M.C.]]'s cover of "[[Walk This Way]]", a track [[rap rock|blending rock and roll with hip hop]].<ref name="mtv"/> In reaching number 4 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100,<ref name="Rock on the Net"/> the song and its frequently-aired video confirmed rap's mainstream appeal and resurrected Aerosmith's career by introducing the band's music to a new generation.<ref name="Biography.com">{{cite web| title = Aerosmith Biography&nbsp;— Biography.com | publisher = Biography.com | url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9542493&page=3 | accessdate=April 4, 2008}}</ref>

Yet the band members' drug problems still stood in their way. In 1986, Tyler completed a successful [[drug rehabilitation]] program, after an intervention by his fellow band members, a doctor, and manager [[Tim Collins (manager)|Tim Collins]], who believed that the band's future would not be bright if Tyler did not get treated. The rest of the band members also completed drug rehab programs over the course of the next couple of years. According to the band's tell-all autobiography, Collins pledged in September 1986 he could make Aerosmith the biggest band in the world by 1990 if they all completed drug rehab.<ref>Davis, pp. 1–15</ref> Their next album was crucial because of the commercial disappointment of ''Done With Mirrors'', and as the band members became clean, they worked hard to make their next album a success.<ref>Davis, p. 454</ref>

===''Permanent Vacation'' and ''Pump'' (1987–1991)===
''[[Permanent Vacation (album)|Permanent Vacation]]'' was released in September 1987, becoming a major hit and the band's bestselling album in over a decade (selling 5 million copies in the U.S.),<ref name="RIAA&nbsp;— Searchable Database"/> with all three of its singles ("[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]", "[[Rag Doll (Aerosmith song)|Rag Doll]]", and "[[Angel (Aerosmith song)|Angel]]") reaching the Top 20 of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="Aerosmith Chart Positions"/> Steven Tyler reveals in his autobiography that the album was "...the first one we ever did sober."<ref>Steven Tyler with David Dalton (2011) The Autobiography: Does the noise in my head bother you?. London: Harper Collins Publishers. page 242.</ref> Part of ''Permanent Vacation'''s commercial success involved producer [[Bruce Fairbairn]] whose production touches (such as sound effects and high-quality recording) added interest to the album and the use of outside songwriters such as [[Desmond Child]], [[Jim Vallance]], and [[Holly Knight]] who assisted the band with lyrics. While the group was initially hesitant to using outside songwriters, including Tyler being furious for Knight getting songwriting credits for changing one word ("Rag Time" became "Rag Doll"), the method paid off, as ''Permanent Vacation'' became the band's most successful album in a decade. The group went on [[Permanent Vacation Tour|a subsequent tour]] with labelmates [[Guns N' Roses]] (who have cited Aerosmith as a major influence), which was intense at times because of Aerosmith's new struggle to stay clean amidst Guns N' Roses' well-publicized, rampant drug use.<ref>Davis, pp. 460–461</ref>

Aerosmith's next album was even more successful. ''[[Pump (album)|Pump]]'', released in September 1989, featured three Top Ten singles: "[[What It Takes (Aerosmith song)|What It Takes]]", "[[Janie's Got a Gun]]", and "[[Love in an Elevator]]", as well as the Top 30 "[[The Other Side (Aerosmith song)|The Other Side]]",<ref name="Aerosmith Chart Positions"/> re-establishing the band as a serious musical force.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Pump'' – Review |work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2200 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20081216114257/http://www.blender.com:80/guide/reviews.aspx?id=2200 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 }}</ref> ''Pump'' was a critical and commercial success, eventually selling 7 million copies,<ref name="RIAA&nbsp;— Searchable Database"/> spawning several music videos that were in regular rotation on MTV, and achieving four-star ratings from major music magazines.<ref>{{cite web| title = Pump: Aerosmith: Review: Rolling Stone |author = Kim Neely |work=Rolling Stone | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/300286/review/6212939/pump | accessdate=March 31, 2008}}</ref> ''Pump'' ranked as the fourth-bestselling album of 1990.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1990/the-billboard-200 Billboard.com – Year End Charts – Year-end Albums – The Billboard 200<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The band also won its first [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] in the category of [[Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], for "Janie's Got a Gun".<ref name="grammy"/> In addition, the video for "Janie's Got a Gun" won two [[MTV Video Music Awards|Video Music Awards]] and was ranked as one of the 100 greatest videos of all time by ''Rolling Stone'', MTV, and VH1.

Rock critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] claimed that ''Pump'' "revels in [pop concessions] without ever losing sight of Aerosmith's dirty hard rock core", going on to say that, "such ambition and successful musical eclectism make ''Pump'' rank with ''Toys in the Attic'' and ''Rocks''."<ref>{{cite web| title = Pump – Aerosmith | author = Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=AllMusic | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pump-r182 | accessdate=January 8, 2012}}</ref> The recording process for ''Pump'' was documented in the video ''[[The Making of Pump]]'', which has since been re-released as a DVD.

On December 22, ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine reported that Tyler had entered a rehabilitation facility to manage his addiction to painkillers, brought on by injuries to his knees, legs, and feet, that resulted from years of performing.

The interplay between Joe Perry and Brad Whitford has been inspiring to many bands, especially Guns N' Roses. Joe Perry has received wide recognition and praise as a lead guitarist, and has shared the stage many times with [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Jeff Beck]], who Perry cites as primary influences. He and Tyler were asked by Page to induct Led Zeppelin into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]; during the ceremony, which took place in 1995, Tyler and Perry delivered their speech and joined the band onstage for a brief set. During Beck's and Metallica's induction in 2009, they invited Perry and Page to play the Yardbirds/Zeppelin/Aerosmith classic "[[Train Kept A-Rollin']]". Other collaborations, either by individual members of the band or by Aerosmith as a whole, have included [[Alice Cooper]] on his ''[[Trash (Alice Cooper album)|Trash]]'' album, [[Guns N' Roses]] (who opened for Aerosmith during their 1988 tour and had covered "Mama Kin" on their first release) and [[B'z]]. As a testimony to their importance in American popular culture as a whole, Aerosmith have also collaborated with popular non-rock artists, such as [[Run-DMC]], [[Eminem]] ("[[Sing for the Moment]]"), and [[Carrie Underwood]], and performed with [['N Sync]], [[Britney Spears]], [[Mary J. Blige]], and [[Nelly]] for the [[Super Bowl XXXV]] halftime show.<ref name="mtv"/><ref name = "Sports Illustrated"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2002_05F_emshow.html |title=Feature for May 28, 2002 - Eminem's "The Eminem Show" |publisher=Rapreviews.com |date=2002-05-28 |accessdate=2015-08-26}}</ref><ref name=RS1>{{cite web|last=Browne|first=David|title=30-Jul-12 Aeromith's New Album Features Vocals By Carrie Underwood, Julian Lennon And Johnny Depp|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aerosmith-tap-johnny-depp-carrie-underwood-for-another-dimension-lp-20120730|work=Rollingstone.com|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}</ref> Country artists [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Mark Chesnutt]] both scored hit singles with covers of Aerosmith songs; Brooks in 1995 with "[[Fever (Aerosmith song)|The Fever]]", a reworking of Aerosmith's 1993 song,<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=garth brooks|chart=Country Songs}}|title=Garth Brooks Album & Song Chart History – Country Songs|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> and Chesnutt in 1999 with a cover of Aerosmith's 1998 song "[[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing]]".<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=mark chesnutt|chart=Country Songs}}|title=Mark Chesnutt Album & Song Chart History – Country Songs|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=August 12, 2011}}</ref>

Like many of their 1970s contemporaries including [[Led Zeppelin]] and [[Alice Cooper]], the members of Aerosmith were prone to excess and debauchery. Drug consumption was rampant; the recording sessions for 1976's ''[[Rocks (Aerosmith album)|Rocks]]'' and 1977's ''[[Draw the Line (Aerosmith album)|Draw the Line]]'' were especially noted for their substance indulgence, including [[heroin]]. In the words of [[Bebe Buell]], "They [Aerosmith] were like a gang of kids with their own planes, [[Porsche]]s, millions of dollars, limitless resources. [...] [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Jimmy Page]] had control, but these boys did not care. They won the prize, hands down, for the rowdiest rock 'n' roll band in that era. No question."<ref name="Davis, Stephen 1997">{{Cite book |author=Davis, Stephen|author2= Aerosmith |title=[[Walk This Way: The Autobiography of Aerosmith]] |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=1997 |isbn= 978-0-380-97594-5 |authorlink= Stephen Davis (music journalist)}}</ref>

In the mid- to late-1970s, the band enjoyed tremendous popularity in the United States and in Japan, though they failed to make a big impression in Britain. Still, they were among the most popular hard rock acts in America in the late 1970s, along with [[Heart (band)|Heart]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[ZZ Top]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]].<ref name="Davis, Stephen 1997"/> Their massive popularity waned, however, following [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]] and [[Brad Whitford]]'s departures. Following both guitarists' return to the band and its complete drug cleanup, Aerosmith made a prodigious return to success, once described as "the single most successful comeback in the history of heavy metal, if not all of popular music."<ref name="Bukszpan 2003">{{Cite book|first=Daniel|last=Bukszpan|title=''The Encyclöpedia öf Heavy Metal''|publisher=[[Sterling Publishing]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7607-4218-1}}</ref> During both the 1970s and the 1987–1995 era, Aerosmith undertook grueling world tours that numbered in the triple digits numbers of dates, headlining or co-headlining festivals along the way, such as the [[Texxas Jam]] in 1978 and 1987, the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at Castle Donington in 1990 and 1994, and [[Woodstock '94]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Aerosmith Setlists | url = http://www.aerosmithsetlists.com/ | accessdate = January 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = 35 Years Ago: Aerosmith and Ted Nugent Highlight Texxas Jam '78 | author = Eduardo Rivadavia | publisher = Ultimate Classic Rock | url = http://ultimateclassicrock.com/texxas-jam-78/ | accessdate = January 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Today in Dallas photo history – 1987: Thousands attend Texxas Jam at the Cotton Bowl | author = Jerome Sims | publisher = Dallas Morning News | url = http://photographyblog.dallasnews.com/2013/06/today-in-dallas-photo-history-1987-thousands-attend-texxas-jam-at-the-cotton-bowl.html/ | accessdate = January 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Monsters of Rock 1990 | publisher = songkick | url = http://www.songkick.com/festivals/4166-monsters-of-rock/id/2335386-monsters-of-rock-1990 | accessdate = January 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Monsters of Rock 1994 | publisher = songkick | url = http://www.songkick.com/festivals/4166-monsters-of-rock/id/766088-monsters-of-rock-1994 | accessdate = January 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Aerosmith, Nine Inch Nails to Play Woodstock Anniversary Concert | author = Fred Goodman | publisher = Rolling Stone | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aerosmith-nine-inch-nails-to-play-woodstock-anniversary-concert-19940602 | accessdate = January 6, 2015}}</ref>

Initially resistant to this medium, the band later became renowned and received numerous awards for pioneering expansive, conceptual music videos, such as those for "[[Janie's Got A Gun]]" (directed by future ''[[Fight Club]]'' director [[David Fincher]]), "[[Livin' on the Edge]]", "[[Cryin']]", "[[Amazing (Aerosmith song)|Amazing]]", "[[Crazy (Aerosmith song)|Crazy]]", "[[Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)]]", and "[[Pink (Aerosmith song)|Pink]]".<ref name="Rock on the Net"/><ref>{{cite web | title = The 10 Best Aerosmith Music Videos | author = Mallika Rao | publisher = Rolling Stone | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/the-10-best-aerosmith-music-videos-20110427 | accessdate = January 6, 2015}}</ref>

==Awards and achievements==
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by Aerosmith}}
Despite Aerosmith's popularity and success in the 1970s, it wasn't until their comeback in the late 1980s and 1990s that they started winning awards and major recognition. In 1987, Aerosmith won the [[Soul Train Music Award for Best Rap – Single]] for the re-mix of "[[Walk This Way]]" with [[Run-D.M.C.]].
