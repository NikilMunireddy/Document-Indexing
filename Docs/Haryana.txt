'''Haryana''' ({{lang-hi|हरियाणा}}, {{IPA-hi|ɦərɪˈjaːɳaː|IPA}}) is one of the [[States and Territories of India|29 states in India]], situated in [[North India]]. It was carved out of the former state of [[East Punjab]] on 1{{nbsp}}November 1966 on a [[linguistic]] basis. It stands [[List of states and territories of India by area|21st]] in terms of its area, which is spread about {{convert|44212|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="profile" /> {{As of|2011}} [[census of India]], the state is [[List of states and union territories of India by population|eighteenth]] largest by population with 25,353,081 inhabitants.

Haryana is one of the wealthier states of India and had the second highest [[per capita income]] in the country at {{INRConvert|119158}} in the year 2012–13 (See [[List of Indian states by GDP]]) and {{INRConvert|132089}} in the year 2013–14,<ref>http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/2014/aug/d2014070801.pdf</ref> including the largest number of rural [[crorepati]]s in India.<ref>[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/18/business/rural.php Poor rural India?

It is bordered by [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Himachal Pradesh]] to the north, and by [[Rajasthan]] to the west and south. The river [[Yamuna]] defines its eastern border with [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Haryana surrounds the country's capital [[Delhi]] on three sides, forming the northern, western and southern borders of Delhi. Consequently, a large area of south Haryana is included in the [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] for purposes of planning for development.

==Etymology==

The name Haryana is found in the works of the 12th-century AD [[Apabhramsha]] writer [[Vibudh Shridhar]] ([[Vikram Samvat|VS]] 1189–1230).<ref>An Early Attestation of the Toponym Ḍhillī, by Richard J. Cohen, Journal of the American Oriental Society,  1989, pp. 513–519
::हरियाणए देसे असंखगाम, गामियण जणि अणवरथ काम|
::परचक्क विहट्टणु सिरिसंघट्टणु, जो सुरव इणा परिगणियं|
::रिउ रुहिरावट्टणु बिउलु पवट्टणु, ढिल्ली नामेण जि भणियं|

::Translation: there  are countless villages in '''Haryana''' country. The villagers there work hard. They don't accept domination of others, and are experts in making the blood of their enemies flow. Indra himself praises this country. The capital of this country is Dhilli.</ref>

The name ''Haryana'' may be derived from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''Hari'' (the Hindu god [[Vishnu]]) and ''ayana'' (home), meaning "the Abode of God".<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/256424/Haryana Haryana] Britannica Online Encyclopedia</ref> However, scholars such as Muni Lal, Murli Chand Sharma, HA Phadke and Sukhdev Singh Chib believe that the name comes from a compound of the words ''Hari'' (Sanskrit ''Harit'', "green") and ''Aranya'' (forest).<ref name="Bijender_Tourism">

=== Pre-history ===
{{Main|Indus Valley Civilization|Vedic Civilization}}
[[File:Kurukshetra.jpg|thumb|left|Manuscript illustration of the [[Battle of Kurukshetra]]]]

[[Rakhigarhi]] village in the [[Hisar district]] is home to the largest and one of the oldest ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization]] sites, dated as over 5,000 years old. Evidence of paved roads, a drainage system, a large-scale rainwater collection storage system, terracotta brick and statue production, and skilled metal working (in both bronze and precious metals) have been uncovered. According to archeologists, Rakhigarhi may be the origin of Harappan civilisation, which arose in the Ghaggar basin in Haryana and gradually and slowly moved to the Indus valley.<ref>{{citation |url=http://thehindu.com/features/friday-review/history-and-culture/rakhigarhi-the-biggest-harappan-site/article5840414.ece |title=Rakhigarhi, the biggest Harappan site |publisher=[[The Hindu]] |date=27 March 2014 }}</ref> Other notable Indus Valley Civilization sites in the state are [[Mitathal]] and [[Banawali]].

===Medieval===
Ancient idols of Jain [[Tirthankara]] (made of bronze and stone) were found in archaeological expeditions in [[Badli]], [[Bhiwani]] ([[Ranila]], [[Charkhi Dadri]], Badhara village), [[Dadri]], [[Gurgaon]] ([[Ferozpur]] Jhirka), [[Hansi]],  [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]] ([[Agroha Mound|Agroha]]), Kasan, Nahad, [[Narnaul]], [[Pehowa]], [[Rewari]], Rohad, [[Rohtak]] (Asthal-[[Abohar]]) and [[Sonepat]] in Haryana.{{sfn|Atul Kumar Sinha|Abhay Kumar Singh|2007|p=401}}

The area that is now Haryana has been ruled by major empires of India. [[Panipat]] is known for three seminal battles in the history of India. In the [[First Battle of Panipat]] (1526), [[Babur]] defeated the [[Lodi Empire|Lodis]]. In the [[Second Battle of Panipat]] (1556), [[Akbar]] defeated the local Haryanvi Hindu Emperor of Delhi, who belonged to [[Rewari]]. [[Hemu]], had earlier won 22 battles across India from Punjab to Bengal defeating Mughals and Afghans. Hemu had defeated Akbar's forces twice at Agra and [[Battle of Delhi]] in 1556 to become last Hindu Emperor of India with formal Coronation at [[Purana Quila]] in Delhi on 7th Oct. 1556. In the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] (1761), the Afghan king [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]] defeated the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Arnold P. Kaminsky |author2=Roger D.

===Formation===
Haryana state was formed on 1{{nbsp}}November 1966. The Indian government set up the Shah Commission under the chairmanship of Justice JC Shah on 23 April 1966 to divide the existing [[Punjab, India]] and determine the boundaries of the new state of Haryana after consideration of the languages spoken by the people. The commission delivered its report on 31{{nbsp}}May 1966 whereby the then-districts of [[Hisar (district)|Hisar]], [[Mahendragarh]], [[Gurgaon]], [[Rohtak]] and [[Karnal]] were to be a part of the new state of Haryana. Further, the [[tehsil]]s of [[Jind]] and [[Narwana]] in the [[Sangrur]] district—along with [[Naraingarh]], [[Ambala]] and [[Jagadhri]]—were to be included.<ref>{{citation|title=the punjab reorganisation act, 1966 - Chief Secretary, Haryana|url=http://csharyana.gov.in/WriteReadData/Acts/Re-Organisation/1474.pdf}}</ref>

The commission recommended that the tehsil of Kharad, which includes [[Chandigarh]], the state capital of Punjab, should be a part of Haryana. However, only a small portion of Kharad was given to Haryana.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.haryana-online.com/History/history_1966-.htm|title=History of Haryana - Haryana Day: A new state is born!}}</ref> The city of Chandigarh was made a [[union territory]], serving as the capital of both Punjab and Haryana.<ref>{{citation|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/haryana-will-get-chandigarh-punjab-can-claim-lahore-or-shimla-says-peeved-hooda/1/296302.html|title=Haryana will get Chandigarh, Punjab can claim Lahore or Shimla, says a peeved Hooda|date=25 July 2013|publisher=}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:YamunaRiver.jpg|thumb|[[Yamuna]] River near the Haryana Border]]

Haryana is a landlocked state in northern India. It is between 27°39' to 30°35' N latitude and between 74°28' and 77°36' E longitude.{{sfn|NIDM|p=2}} The total geographical area of the state is 4.42&nbsp;m ha, which is 1.4% of the geographical area of the country.<ref name=agri/> The altitude of Haryana varies between 700 and 3600&nbsp;ft (200 metres to 1200 metres) above sea level.<ref>{{citation|title=Organizations|url=http://haryana.gov.in/departments/organizations.html}}</ref> As per India State of Forest Report, FSI, 2013, the Forest Cover in the state is 1586&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> which is 3.59% of the state's geographical area and the Tree Cover in the state is 1282&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> which is 2.90% of the geographical area. Thus the Forest and Tree Cover of the Haryana state is 6.49% of its geographical area.<ref>{{citation|title=Welcome To Our Website|url=http://haryanaforest.gov.in/HomeContent1.aspx|publisher=Haryana Forest Department}}</ref>

Haryana has four main geographical features.{{sfn|NIDM|p=3}}
* The [[Yamuna]]-[[Ghaggar]] plain forming the largest part of the state
* The [[Shivalik Hills]] to the northeast
* Semi-desert sandy plain to the southwest
* The [[Aravalli Range]] in the south

===Rivers===
The [[Yamuna]] flows along the state's eastern boundary while the ancient [[Sarasvati River]] is said to have flowed from [[Yamuna Nagar]], but has now disappeared.<ref>{{citation|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/haryana/river-saraswati-is-for-real-found-in-haryana_1591937.html|title=River Saraswati is for real, found in Haryana|work=Zee Nees|date=8 May 2015}}</ref>

Haryana's main seasonal river, the [[Ghaggar]] rises in the outer [[Himalayas]], between the Yamuna and the [[Satluj]] and enters the state near [[Pinjore]] in the [[Panchkula district]]. Passing through [[Ambala]] and [[Sirsa, India|Sirsa]], it reaches [[Bikaner]] in [[Rajasthan]] and runs for {{convert|460|km|abbr=on}} before disappearing into the deserts of Rajasthan. Important tributaries include the [[Chautang]] and Tangri.<ref name=kurukshetra>{{citation|url=http://www.kurukshetra.nic.in/AtAGlance/Rivers/index.htm|title=Geography- others|publisher=District Administration, Kurukshetra}}</ref>

The seasonal [[Markanda River]] is a stream, which in ancient times was known as the Aruna. It originates from the lower [[Shivalik Hills]] and enters Haryana west of [[Ambala]]. During monsoons, this stream swells into a raging torrent notorious for its devastating power. The surplus water is carried on to the Sanisa Lake where the Markanda joins the Saraswati and later the Ghaggar.<ref name=kurukshetra/>

Three other rivulets in and around the Mewat hills, the Indori, Dohan and Kasavati all flow from East to West and once were tributaries of the [[Drishadwati]]/[[Saraswati]] rivers.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite web|url=http://www.haryana-online.com/geography.htm|title=Geography of Haryana - Map, Shivaliks, Ghaggar, Yamuna, Saraswati, Morni - India|work=haryana-online.com}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Haryana to meet Rajasthan over stopping of river waters|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Haryana-to-meet-Rajasthan-over-stopping-of-river-waters/articleshow/45399754.cms|work=Times of India|author=Siwach, Sukhbir|date=7 December 2014}}</ref>
