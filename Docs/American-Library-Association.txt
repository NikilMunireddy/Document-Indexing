The '''American Library Association''' ('''ALA''') is a [[non-profit organization]] based in the [[United States]] that promotes [[library|libraries]] and library education internationally. It is the oldest and largest library association in the world,<ref>{{cite web|title=American Library Association - MSN Encarta <!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE -->|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encnet/refpages/RefArticle.aspx?refid=761563357|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKCy7XB|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref> with more than 62,000 members.<ref>"Report to Council and Executive Board," by ALA Executive Director [[Keith Michael Fiels]], EBD#12.36 2009-2010, 18 June 2010 (misdated as 18 June 2009). "Overall ALA Membership as of May 2010 stands at 62,251."</ref>

==History==
Founded by [[Justin Winsor]], [[Charles Ammi Cutter]], [[Samuel Swett Green|Samuel S. Green]], James L. Whitney, [[Melvil Dewey]] (Melvil Dui), Fred B. Perkins, [[Charles Evans (librarian)|Charles Evans]], and [[Thomas W. Bicknell]] in 1876 in [[Philadelphia]] and chartered<ref>([http://www.ala.org/aboutala/missionhistory/history/1879 ALA Charter])</ref> in 1879 in [[Massachusetts]], its head office is now in [[Chicago]].

During the [[Centennial Exposition]] in Philadelphia in 1876, 103 librarians, 90 men and 13 women, responded to a call for a "Convention of Librarians" to be held October 4–6 at the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. At the end of the meeting, according to Ed Holley in his essay "ALA at 100," "the register was passed around for all to sign who wished to become charter members," making October 6, 1876, to be ALA's birthday.
In attendance were 90 men and 13 women, among them Justin Winsor (Boston Public, Harvard), William Frederick Poole (Chicago Public, Newberry), Charles Ammi Cutter (Boston Athenaeum), Melvil Dewey, and Richard Rogers Bowker. Attendees came from as far west as Chicago and from England.<ref>{{cite web | title=History | url=http://www.ala.org/aboutala/history}}</ref>
The aim of the Association, in that resolution, was "to enable librarians to do their present work more easily and at less expense."<ref>http://www.ala.org/aboutala/missionhistory/history</ref> The Association has worked throughout its history to define, extend, protect and advocate for equity of access to information.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=ED462981|title=''Rocks in the Whirlpool: Equity of Access and the American Library Association''}}|  Submitted to the Executive Board of the American Library Association June 14, 2002.| ERIC (Education Resources Information Center)|  ED462981| Retrieved December 21, 2011</ref>

Library activists in the 1930s pressured the American Library Association to be more responsive to issues put forth by young members involved with issues such as peace, segregation, library unions and intellectual freedom.  In 1931, the Junior Members Round Table (JMRT) was formed to provide a voice for the younger members of the ALA, but much of what they had to say resurfaced in the social responsibility movement to come years later.<ref>(Samek, 2001, p.&nbsp;7)</ref>  During this period, the first [[Library Bill of Rights]] (LBR) was drafted by [[Forrest Spaulding]] to set a standard against censorship and was adopted by the ALA in 1939.  This has been recognized as the moment defining modern librarianship as a profession committed to intellectual freedom and the right to read over government dictates.<ref>(Robbins, 1996, p.&nbsp;166)</ref>  The ALA formed the Staff Organization's Round Table in 1936 and the Library Unions Round Table in 1940.

The ALA appointed a committee to study censorship and recommend policy after the banning of ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and the implementation of the LBR.  The committee reported in 1940 that intellectual freedom and professionalism were linked and recommended a permanent committee – Committee on Intellectual Freedom.<ref name="McCook, 2011, p. 63">(McCook, 2011, p.&nbsp;63)</ref>  The ALA made revisions to strengthen the LBR in June 1948, approved the Statement on Labeling in 1951 to discourage labeling material as subversive, and adopted the Freedom to Read Statement and the Overseas Library Statement in 1953.<ref name="McCook, 2011, p. 63"/>

In 1961, the ALA took a stand regarding service to [[African Americans]] and others, advocating for equal library service for all.  An amendment was passed to the LBR in 1961 that made clear that an individual's library use should not be denied or abridged because of race, religion, national origin, or political views.  Some communities decided to close their doors rather than desegregate.<ref>Rubin, R. E. (2010). Foundations of library and information science (3rd edn). New York: Neal-Schuman, p.294</ref>  In 1963, the ALA commissioned a study, ''Access to Public Libraries'', which found direct and indirect discrimination in American libraries.<ref>(McCook, 2011, p.&nbsp;55)</ref>

In 1967 some librarians protested against a pro-[[Vietnam War]] speech given by General [[Maxwell D. Taylor]] at the annual ALA conference in San Francisco; the former president of [[Sarah Lawrence College]], Harold Taylor, spoke to the Middle-Atlantic Regional Library Conference about socially responsible professionalism; and less than one year later a group of librarians proposed that the ALA schedule a new round table program discussion on the social responsibilities of librarians at its next annual conference in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].  This group called themselves the Organizing Committee for the ALA Round Table on Social Responsibilities of Libraries.  This group drew in many other under-represented groups in the ALA who lacked power, including the Congress for Change in 1969.<ref>(Samek, 2001, pp.&nbsp;67–8)</ref>  This formation of the committee was approved in 1969 and would change its name to the '''Social Responsibilities Round Table''' (SRRT) in 1971).  After its inception, the Round Table of Social Responsibilities began to press ALA leadership to address issues such as library unions, working conditions, wages, and intellectual freedom.  The [[Freedom to Read Foundation]] was created by ALA's Executive Board in 1969.<ref>(Samek, 2001, p. 69)</ref> The [[Black Caucus of the American Library Association|Black Caucus of the ALA]] and the Office for Literacy and Outreach were set up in 1970.<ref>(Rubin, 2004, p. 296)</ref>

In June 1990, the ALA approved “Policy on Library Services to the Poor” and in 1996 the Task Force on Hunger Homelessness, and Poverty was formed to resurrect and promote the ALA guidelines on library services to the poor.<ref>(Berman, 2001, p.&nbsp;12)</ref>

In 2014 Courtney Young, the president of the association, commented on the background and implications of a racist joke author [[Daniel Handler]] made as African-American writer [[Jacqueline Woodson]] received a National Book Award for ''Brown Girl Dreaming''. "His comments were inappropriate and fell far short of the association's commitment to diversity," said Young. "Handler's remarks come at a time when the publishing world has little diversity. Works from authors and illustrators of color make up less than 8 percent of children’s titles produced in 2013. The ALA hopes this regrettable incident will be used to open a dialogue on the need for diversity in the publishing industry, particularly in regards to books for young people."<ref>[http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/books/2014/11/29/award-winning-author-jacqueline-woodson-responds-racist-joke "Award-Winning Author Jacqueline Woodson Responds to Racist Joke"], ''The Advocate'', November 29, 2014</ref>

The ALA Archives, including historical documents, non-current records, and digital records, are currently held at the [[University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign]] archives.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/library/alaarchive | title =ALA Archives | publisher =ALA | accessdate =September 1, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100920124447/http://ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/library/alaarchive/index.cfm| archivedate= 20 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Membership==
ALA membership is open to any person or organization, though most of its members are [[library|libraries]] or librarians. Most members live and work in the United States, with international members comprising 3.5% of total membership.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/aboutala/missionhistory/plan/international | title =ALA International Member Survey | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref>

==Governing structure==
[[File:2010 Camila Alire AmericanLibraryAssociation.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Camila Alire]], 2009&ndash;2010 President of the ALA]] 
The ALA is governed by an elected council and an executive board. Since 2002, [[Keith Michael Fiels]] has been the ALA executive director (CEO).<ref>{{cite press release | date = 2002-04-22 | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/pressreleasesbucket/keithmichael.htm | title =Keith Michael Fiels named ALA's new Executive Director | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> Policies and programs are administered by various committees and round tables. One of the organization's most visible tasks is overseen by the Office for Accreditation, which formally reviews and authorizes American and Canadian academic institutions that offer degree programs in [[Library science|library and information science]]. The ALA's current President is Sari Feldman (2015-2016).

===Activities===
The official purpose of the association is "to promote library service and librarianship." Members may join one or more of eleven membership divisions that deal with specialized topics such as academic, school, or public libraries, technical or reference services, and library administration. Members may also join any of seventeen round tables that are grouped around more specific interests and issues than the broader set of ALA divisions.

====Notable sub-organizations====
In 1970, the ALA founded the first [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] professional organization, called the "Task Force on Gay Liberation", now known as the [[Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table]] or GLBT Round Table.<ref name=glbtrt>{{cite web | title=Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgendered Round Table (GLBTRT) |url=http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/ | publisher=ALA | accessdate=2010-09-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100916223855/http://ala.org/ala/mgrps/rts/glbtrt/index.cfm| archivedate= 16 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name=gittings>{{cite book |last=Gittings |first=Barbara |title=Gays in Library Land: The Gay and Lesbian Task Force of the American Library Association: The First Sixteen Years |location=Philadelphia |year=1990}}</ref> [[Barbara Gittings]] became its coordinator in 1971. In the early 1970s, the Task Force on Gay Liberation campaigned to have books about the gay liberation movement at the [[Library of Congress]] reclassified from HQ 71–471 (“Abnormal Sexual Relations, Including Sexual Crimes”). In 1972, after receiving a letter requesting the reclassification, the Library of Congress agreed to make the shift, reclassifying those books into a newly created category, HQ 76.5 (“Homosexuality, Lesbianism—Gay Liberation Movement, Homophile Movement”). In 1971 the GLBTRT created the first award for GLBT books, the Stonewall Book Award, which celebrates books of exceptional merit that relate to LGBT issues. ''[[Patience and Sarah]]'' by [[Alma Routsong]] (pen name Isabel Miller) was the first winner. In 1992, American Libraries published a photo of the GLBTRT (then called the Gay and Lesbian Task Force) on the cover of its July/August issue, drawing both criticism and praise from the library world. Some commenters called the cover “in poor taste” and accused American Libraries of “glorifying homosexuality,” while others were supportive of the move. Christine Williams, who wrote an essay about the controversy surrounding the cover, concluded that in the mid-90s, the library world was “not an especially welcoming place to gays and lesbians." In 2010, the GLBTRT announced a new committee, the Over the Rainbow Committee. This committee annually compiles a bibliography of books that show the GLBT community in a favorable light and reflects the interests of adults. The bibliographies provide guidance to libraries in the selection of positive GLBT materials.

On July 23, 1976, the [[Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship]] was established as a Council Committee of the ALA on recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee with the same name (which had been appointed by the President of the ALA in December 1975) and of the Committee on Organization. The Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship works to "officially represent the diversity of women's interest within ALA and to ensure that the Association considers the rights of the majority (women) in the library field; to promote and initiate the collection, analysis, dissemination, and coordination of information on the status of women in librarianship; to coordinate the activities of ALA units which consider questions of special relevance for women; to identify lags, gaps, and possible discrimination in resources and programs relating to women; in cooperation with other ALA units, to help develop and evaluate tools, guidelines, and programs designed to enhance the opportunities and the image of women in the library profession, thus raising the level of consciousness concerning women; to establish contacts with committees on women within other professional groups and to officially represent ALA concerns at interdisciplinary meetings on women's equality; and to provide Council and Membership with reports needed for establishment of policies and actions related to the status of women in librarianship; and to monitor ALA units to ensure consideration of the rights of women." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/offices/hrdr/abouthrdr/hrdrliaisoncomm/statusofwomen/committeestatus|title=COSWL|work=ala.org}}</ref><ref name="library.illinois.edu">http://www.library.illinois.edu/archives/ala/holdings/?p=creators/creator&id=3540</ref> In 1979 the Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship received the Bailey K. Howard - World Book Encyclopedia - ALA Goal Award to develop a profile of ALA personal members, known as the COSWL Study. In 1980 the Committee on the Status of Women in Librarianship was awarded the J. Morris Jones - World Book Encyclopedia - ALA Goals Award with the OLPR Advisory Committee to undertake a special project on equal pay for work of equal value.<ref name="library.illinois.edu"/>

====National outreach====
The ALA is affiliated with regional, state, and student chapters (SCALA) across the country. It organizes conferences, participates in library standards development, and publishes a number of books and periodicals. The ALA publishes the magazines ''[[American Libraries]]'' and ''[[Booklist]]''. Along with other organizations, it sponsors the annual [[Banned Books Week]] the last week of September. [[Young Adult Library Services Association]] ('''YALSA''') also sponsors [[Teen Read Week]], the third week of each October, and [[Teen Tech Week]], the second week of each March. In addition, the ALA helps to promote diversity in the library profession with various outreach activities, including the Spectrum Scholarship program, which awards academic scholarships to minority library students each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/offices/diversity/spectrum|title=Spectrum Scholarship Program|work=ala.org}}</ref>

Beside the Alex Awards, ALA disseminates some annual lists of [[ALA Notable Books|"Notable"]] and "Best" books and other media.

The annual awards roster includes the [[John Cotton Dana Award]] for excellence in library public relations.

In 2000, the Office for Literacy and Outreach Services (OLOS) launched the [[Jean E. Coleman Library Outreach Lecture]] in tribute to the work of the first OLOS director, Dr. Jean E. Coleman.  Barbara J. Ford gave the inaugural lecture, "Libraries, Literacy, Outreach and the Digital Divide."

Since 2006, the ALA has selected a class of [[Emerging Leaders]], typically comprising about 100 librarians and library school students. This minor distinction is a form of organizational outreach to new librarians. The Emerging Leaders are allocated to project groups tasked with developing solutions to specified problems within ALA divisions. The class meets at the ALA Midwinter and Annual Meetings, commonly January and June. Project teams may present posters of their completed projects at the Annual.<ref>Emerging Leaders Program Info: http://www.ala.org/educationcareers/leadership/emergingleaders</ref>

==== Conferences ====
The ALA and its divisions hold numerous conferences throughout the year. The two largest conferences are the annual conference and the midwinter meeting. The latter is typically held in January and focused on internal business, while the annual conference is typically held in June and focused on exhibits and presentations. The ALA annual conference is notable for being one of the largest professional conferences in existence, typically drawing over 25,000 attendees.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=confservices | title =Conference Services | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2006-11-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061116140233/http://www.ala.org/template.cfm?Section=confservices| archivedate= 16 November 2006 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

The ALA [[Public Library Advocacy|advocates]] positions on [[United States]] political issues that it believes are related to libraries and librarianship. For court cases that touch on issues about which the organization holds positions, the ALA often files [[amicus curiae|amici curiae]] briefs, voluntarily offering information on some aspect of the case to assist the court in deciding a matter before it. The ALA has an office in [[Washington, D.C.]], that [[Lobbying|lobbies]] [[United States Congress|Congress]] on issues relating to libraries, information and communication. It also provides materials to libraries that may include information on how to apply for grants, how to comply with the law, and how to oppose a law.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/wo/index.cfm | title =Washington Office | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-09-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100920060616/http://ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/wo/index.cfm| archivedate= 20 September 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

In 1950, the Intellectual Freedom Committee, the forerunner of the OIF, investigated the termination of [[Ruth W. Brown]] as librarian of the [[Bartlesville]] Public Library, a position she held in the [[Oklahoma]] town for 30 years.  Brown's termination was based on the false allegation that she was a communist and that she had as part of the library's serials collection two left wing publications, ''[[The New Republic]]'' and ''[[The Nation]]''.  The ALA support for her and the subsequent legal case was the first such investigation undertaken by the ALA or one of its state chapters.<ref>Robbins, L.S. (2000). The dismissal of Miss Ruth Brown.

In 1999, radio personality [[Laura Schlessinger]] campaigned publicly against the ALA's intellectual freedom policy, specifically in regard to the ALA's refusal to remove a link on its web site to a specific sex-education site for teens.<ref>{{cite web | date = 1999-05-10 | url =http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA158676.html | title ="Dr. Laura" Continues Criticism of ALA | work =Library Journal | publisher = MediaSource, Inc. | accessdate =2006-11-14}}</ref> [[Sharon Priestly]] said, however, that Schlessinger "distorted and misrepresented the ALA stand to make it sound like the ALA was saying porno for 'children' is O.K."<ref>{{cite journal | last =Priestly | first =Sharon |date=Winter 2001 |  title =Don't Listen to Dr. Laura | journal =Free Inquiry | publisher = | volume = 41 | issue = 1}}</ref>

In 2002, the ALA filed suit with library users and the ACLU against the United States [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA), which required libraries receiving federal E-rate discounts for Internet access to install a "technology protection measure" to prevent children from accessing "visual depictions that are obscene, child pornography, or harmful to minors."<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ifea.net/cipa.pdf | title =Text of the Children's Internet Protection Act}}</ref> At trial, the federal district court struck down the law as unconstitutional.<ref>''United States v. Am. Lib. Asso.'', 201 F.Supp.2d 401, 490 (2002)</ref> The government appealed this decision, and on June 23, 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld the law as constitutional as a condition imposed on institutions in exchange for government funding. In upholding the law, the Supreme Court, adopting the interpretation urged by the U.S. Solicitor General at oral argument, made it clear that the constitutionality of CIPA would be upheld only "if, as the Government represents, a librarian will unblock filtered material or disable the Internet software filter without significant delay on an adult user's request."<ref>{{cite web | year = | url =http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=539&invol=194 | title =''US v ALA'' 539 U.S. 194, 2003 | format = | work = | publisher =FindLaw | accessdate =2007-03-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070219172248/http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&vol=539&invol=194| archivedate= 19 February 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

===Privacy===
In 2003, the ALA passed a resolution opposing the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which called sections of the law "a present danger to the constitutional rights and privacy rights of library users".<ref>{{cite web | date =2003-01-29 | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/statementspols/ifresolutions/resolutionusa | title =Resolution on the USA PATRIOT Act and Related Measures that Infringe on the Rights of Library Users | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-09-01}}</ref> Since then, the ALA and its members have sought to change the law by working with members of Congress and educating their communities and the press about the law's potential to violate the privacy rights of library users. ALA has also participated as an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' in lawsuits filed by individuals challenging the constitutionality of the USA PATRIOT Act, including a lawsuit filed by four Connecticut librarians after the library consortium they managed was served with a [[national security letter]] seeking information about library users.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cowan | first = Alison Leigh | date = 2006-05-31 | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/nyregion/31library.html?ex=1306728000&en=9f197630a8f4a0a9&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | title = Four Librarians Finally Break Silence in Records Case | work = The New York Times | accessdate =2007-02-07}}</ref> After several months of litigation, the lawsuit was dismissed when the FBI decided to withdraw the National Security Letter.<ref>{{cite web | date = 2006-06-26 | url =http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/FBI_drops_demand_for_information_from_0626.html | archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/6I7WHRqQX | archivedate= 2013-07-15|deadurl= no| title = FBI drops demand for information from Connecticut library group | work =Raw Story | accessdate =2007-02-07}}</ref> In 2007 the "Connecticut Four" were honored by the ALA with the Paul Howard Award for Courage for their challenge to the National Security Letter and gag order provision of the USA PATRIOT Act.<ref>McCook, Kathleen de la Peña (2011), ''Introduction to Public Librarianship, '' pp. 63&ndash;64. 2nd ed. New York, Neal-Schuman.</ref>

In 2006, the ALA sold humorous "radical militant librarian" buttons for librarians to wear in support of the ALA's stances on intellectual freedom, privacy, and civil liberties.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.ala.org/offices/oif/archive/radicalbutton | title = "Radical, Militant Librarian" Button | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2010-09-01}}</ref> Inspiration for the button’s design came from documents obtained from the FBI by the [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] (EPIC) through a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request. The request revealed a series of e-mails in which FBI agents complained about the "radical, militant librarians" while criticizing the reluctance of FBI management to use the secret warrants authorized under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act.<ref>{{cite press release | date=2006-01-17| url =http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=pressreleases&template=/contentmanagement/contentdisplay.cfm&ContentID=113573| title = ALA introduces "Radical, Militant Librarian" button | publisher =ALA | accessdate =2007-03-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070404072818/http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=pressreleases&template=/contentmanagement/contentdisplay.cfm&ContentID=113573| archivedate= 4 April 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
