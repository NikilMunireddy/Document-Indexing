Hamas, its military wing, together with several charities it runs, has been designated by several governments as a terrorist organization. Others regard this designation as problematic. Israel outlawed  Hamas in 1989, in 1996 the  United States followed suit, as did Canada in  2002.  The [[European Union]] defined the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades as terrorist in  2001, and put Hamas in its list of terrorist organizations in 2003, a designation successfully challenged by Hamas in the courts. An Egyptian court ruled it was a terrorist organization in 2015. Japan froze Hamas assets according to its legislation on terrorist entities in 2006. Australia and the United Kingdom have designated the military wing of Hamas as a terrorist organization. The organization is also banned in [[Jordan]]. It is not regarded as a terrorist organization by Iran, Russia, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, China, and Brazil.

==Etymology==
''Hamas'' is an [[acronym]] of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase حركة المقاومة الاسلامية or ''Harakat al-Muqāwama al-Islāmiyya'', meaning "Islamic Resistance Movement". The Arabic word 'Hamas' (حماس) means "courage" or "zeal".<ref>Martha Crenshaw, John Pimlott, [https://books.google.com/books?id=j4p4CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT415 ''International Encyclopedia of Terrorism,''] Routledge, 2015 p.415.</ref> The Hamas covenant interprets its name to mean "strength and bravery".<ref name ="Jefferis">Jennifer Jefferis,[https://books.google.com/books?id=rzRpCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA150  ''Hamas: Terrorism, Governance, and Its Future in Middle East Politics,'']  [[ABC-CLIO]], 2016 p.119.</ref><ref name="charter1">{{cite web|title=The Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)|publisher=MidEast Web|date=August 18, 1988|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/hamas.htm}}</ref>

==Leadership and structure==
[[File:Hamasleadership.png|thumb|Map of key Hamas leadership nodes. 2010]]
[[File:Khaled Meshaal 01.jpg|thumb|Current leader, [[Khaled Meshaal]]]]
Hamas  inherited from its predecessor a tripartite structure that consisted in the provision of social services, of religious training and military operations under a Shura Council. Traditionally it had 4 distinct functions: a charitable social welfare division(''dawah'')  (b) a military division for procuring weapons and undertaking operations (''al-Mujahideen  al Filastinun'') (c)a security service (''Jehaz Aman'') and a (d)  media branch (''A’alam'').<ref>Levitt 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&pg=PA11  pp.10-11].</ref> Hamas has both an internal leadership  within the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and an external leadership, split between a Gaza group directed by [[Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook]] from his exile first in Damascus and then in Egypt, and a Kuwaiti group (''Kuwaidia'') under [[Khaled Mashal]].<ref>Levitt, 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&pg=PA11 pp.11-12].</ref> The Kuwaiti group of Palestinian exiles began to receive extensive funding from the [[Gulf States]] after its leader Mashal broke with [[Yasser Arafat]]'s decision to side with [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Invasion of Kuwait]], with Mashal insisting that Iraq withdraw.<ref>[[Sara Roy]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=mX1dAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 ''Hamas and Civil Society in Gaza: Engaging the Islamist Social Sector,''] [[Princeton University Press]], Rev.ed. 2013 p.30.</ref>

The exact nature of the organization is unclear, secrecy being maintained for fear of Israeli assassinations and to conceal operational activities.  Formally, Hamas maintains the wings are separate and independent. Matthew Levitt maintains this is a public myth. Davis argues that they are both separate and combined for reasons of internal and external political necessity. The thoroughness of Israeli intelligence surveillance and  an extensive base of informants, makes communications between the political and military wings difficult. After the assassination of [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi]], the occasional political direction of the militant wing diminished, with field commanders given discretional autonomy on operations.<ref>Davis 2016 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44 pp.44-45].</ref>

===Consultative councils===
The governing body is the [[Majlis al-Shura]]. The principle behind the Council is based on the [[Qur'an]]ic concept of consultation and  popular assembly (''[[shura]]''), which Hamas leaders argue provides for democracy within an Islamic frasmework.<ref>A. Hovdenak, 'Hamas in Transition:The Failure of Sanctions,' in  Michelle Pace, Peter Seeberg  (eds.),  [https://books.google.com/books?id=RgLcAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA64  ''The European Union's Democratization Agenda in the Mediterranean,''] Routledge, 2013 pp.50-79 p.64.</ref> As the organization grew more complex and Israeli pressure increased it needed a broader base for decisions, the Shura Council was renamed the 'General Consultative Council', elected from members of local council groups  and this in turn elected a 15-member [[Politburo]] (''al-Maktab al-Siyasi'')<ref>Peter Mandaville,[https://books.google.com/books?id=2bvcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA282 ''Islam and Politics,''] Routledge, 2014 Rev.ed, p.282.</ref> that made decisions at the highest level. Representatives come from Gaza, the West Bank, leaders in exile and [[Administrative detention|Israeli prisons]].<ref name="Berti" >Benedetta Berti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EUcDAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA88 ''Armed Political Organizations: From Conflict to Integration,'']  JHU Press, 2013 p.88.</ref>  This organ was located in [[Damascus]] until the [[Syrian Civil War]] led it to transfer to [[Qatar]] in January 2012, when Hamas sided with the civil opposition against the regime of [[Bashar al-Assad]].<ref name="Berti" /><ref>Mohammed Ayoob, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ph6eAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT47 ''Will the Middle East Implode?,''] John Wiley & Sons, 2014 p.47.</ref>

===Social Services Wing===
Hamas developed its social welfare programme by replicating the model established by Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. In Islamic tradition ''dawah'' (lit.'the call to God') obliges the faithful to reach out to others by both proselytising and by charitable works, and typically the latter centre on the mosques which make use of both [[waqf]] endowment resources  and charitable donations ([[zakat]]) to fund  grassroots services like nurseries, schools, orphanages, soup kitchens, women's activities, library services and even sporting clubs within a larger context of preaching and political discussions.<ref>Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&pg=PA16 pp.16-23].</ref> In the 1990s, some 85% of its budget was allocated to the provision of social services.<ref>Phillips [https://books.google.com/books?id=cNq0gvBPcGQC&pg=PA78 p.78]</ref> It has been called perhaps the most significant social services actor in Palestine. By 2000 it or its affiliated charities ran roughly 40% of the social institutions in the West Bank and Gaza and, with other Islamic charities, by 2005 was supporting 120,000 individuals with monthly financial support in Gaza.<ref name = "Shitrit">Lihi Ben Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zUjuCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA71 ''Righteous Transgressions: Women's Activism on the Israeli and Palestinian Religious Right,''] [[Princeton University Press]], 2015 p.71.</ref> Part of the appeal of these institutions is that they fill a vacuum in the administration by the PLO of the Palestinian territories, which had failed to cater to the demand for jobs and broad social services, and is widely viewed as corrupt.<ref name=Phillips>David L.

A certain accounting flexibility allowed these  funds to cover both charitable causes  and military operations, permitting transfer from one to the other.<ref>Davis,[https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA48 pp.47ff].</ref>

===Military wing===
{{main|Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades}}
The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas's military wing was formed in either  mid-1991<ref>Aoibhín de Búrca, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LCJHBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA100 ''Preventing Political Violence Against Civilians: Nationalist Militant Conflict in Northern Ireland, Israel And Palestine,''] Palgrave Macmillan, 2014 pp.100-102.</ref><ref name ="Najib">Mohammad Najib and  Roland Friedrich 'Non-Statutory Armed Groups and Security Sector Governance,' in Roland Friedrich, Arnold Luethold  (eds.),[https://books.google.com/books?id=icV4k__xMmgC&pg=PA106  ''Entry-points to Palestinian Security Sector Reform,''] [[Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces|DCAF]], 2007  pp.101-127 p.103.This date is based on a Hamas operation that assassinated the rabbi of the Israeli settlement of [[Kfar Darom]] inside the Gaza Strip.</ref> or 1992,under the direction of [[Yahya Ayyash]], a Hamas field-commander and bomb-maker assassinated by Israel in 1996. It was constituted from units associated with the earlier ''al-Jihad wa Da’wa'', an umbrella group that had gathered in militants from various Islamic resistance cells like the ''Al-Mujahidun al-Filastiniun'' (Palestinian fighters).<ref>Davis,[https://books.google.com/books?id=bmaFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT110 pp.110-111].</ref><ref name = "Guidère" /> established by [[Salah Shehade]] in 1986.<ref>Najib p.103.</ref>

The wing takes its name from the prewar [[Palestinian nationalism|militant Palestinian nationalist]] Sheikh [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam]], though Hamas cells sometimes refer to themselves as "Students of Ayyash", "Students of the Engineer", or "Yahya Ayyash Units".<ref name = "Guidère" />  At the outset, weapons were hard to come by, and the organization began to resort to intermittent kidnappings of soldiers to secure arms and munitions. This approach had been justified two years earlier when, in the wake of the  [[1990 Temple Mount riots|killing of some 20 Palestinians were killed]] by Israeli forces dispersing protestors at the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] in 1990, Hamas had declared every Israeli soldier a legitimate target.<ref name ="Engeland">Alincée Van Engeland,'Hamas,' in Jeffrey Ian Ross (ed.)[https://books.google.com/books?id=MFfrBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA319 ''Religion and Violence: An Encyclopedia of Faith and Conflict from Antiquity to the Present,''] Routledge  2015  pp.319-323: p.319.</ref>

Ayyash, with a degree in electrical engineering, quickly improved Hamas's strike capacity by developing [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]] and promoting the tactic of suicide bombings.<ref>Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bmaFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT110 p.111].</ref> By the time of the Al-Aqsa Intifada, Hamas's laboratories had devised a primitive form of rocketry, the Qassam 1,which they first launched in October 2000, carrying a 500 gram warhead with a throw range of 4 kilometres. Both propellant and the explosive were manufactured from chemical fertilizers, though TNT was also tried.<ref>Mohannad Sabry,[https://books.google.com/books?id=ydHRCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA65 ''Sinai: Egypt's Linchpin, Gaza's Lifeline, Israel's Nightmare,''] British Academic Press, 2015 p.65.</ref> Over the next 5 years of the conflict, a 3 kilogram warhead armed version with a strike range of 6-8 kilometres, the Qassam 2, was also produced<ref>Najib p.107</ref>  and in an incremental rise, these rocket types were fired towards Israeli settlements along the  Gaza Strip:4 in 2001,35 in 2002, 155 in 2003,281 in 2004, and 179 in 2005. By 2005, the Qassam 3 had been engineered with a 12-14 kilometre range and a 15 kilo warhead. By 2006, 942 such rockets were launched into southern Israel.<ref>Sabry p.67.</ref> During the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|War with Israel in 2008-9]], Hamas deployed  [[BM-21 Grad|122-mm Grad rocketry]] with a 20-40 kilometre range and a 30 kilogram warhead and a variety of guided [[9M133 Kornet|Kornet]] antitank missiles.<ref>Sabry, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ydHRCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 p.73].</ref> By 2012 Hamas had engineered a version of the [[Fajr-5]] rocket, which was capable of reaching as far as  [[Tel Aviv]],  as was shown after the assassination of [[Ahmed Jabari]] in that year. In the 2014 war its advanced rocketry reached Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and [[Haifa]].<ref>Jefferis,[https://books.google.com/books?id=rzRpCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA119 p.119].</ref> Hamas deployed its increasingly sophisticated rocketry to replace its martyrdom operations.<ref name="Najib p.107">Najib p.107.</ref>
 
While the number of members is known only to the Brigades leadership, Israel estimates the Brigades have a core of several hundred members who receive [[Military training|military style training]], including training in Iran and in [[Syria]] (before the Syrian Civil War).<ref name = "Guidère" >Mathieu Guidère, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tCvhzGiDMYsC&pg=PA173  ''Historical Dictionary of Islamic Fundamentalism,''] [[Scarecrow Press]], 2012 p.173.</ref> Additionally, the brigades have an estimated 10,000-17,000 operatives,<ref>Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zUjuCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA71 p.71].</ref><ref name="Najib p.106">Najib p.106.</ref> forming a backup force whenever circumstances call for reinforcements for the Brigade. Recruitment training lasts for 2 years.<ref name = "Guidère" />

The group's ideology outlines its aim as the liberation of Palestine and the restoration of Palestinian rights under the dispensations set forth in the Qur'an, and this translates into three policy priorities:
<blockquote>To evoke the spirit of Jihad (Resistance) among Palestinians, Arabs, and Muslims; to defend Palestinians and their land against the Zionist occupation and its manifestations; to liberate Palestinians and their land that was usurped by the Zionist occupation forces and settlers.<ref>Najib p.105.</ref></blockquote>
According to its official stipulations, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades' military operations are to be restricted to operating only inside Palestine, engaging with Israeli soldiers, and in exercising the right of self-defense against armed settlers. They are to avoid civilian targets, to respect the enemy's humanity by refraining from mutilation, defacement or excessive killing, and to avoid targeting Westerners either in the occupied zones or beyond.<ref>Najib pp.105-106.</ref>

In practice, Hamas altered its approach restricting actions to 'legitimate military targets' by extended them to Israeli civilians after 7 years.<ref name="Najib p.106"/> Though between 1996 and 2001 it generally refrained from targeting Israeli civilians,<ref name="auto">Najib p.106</ref> it adopted  [[List of Palestinian suicide attacks|sporadic suicide bombings]] in the wake of the [[Cave of the Patriarchs massacre ]] when an Israeli settler in military fatigues, [[Baruch Goldstein]], shot dead 29 Muslims at prayer in  1993.<ref name="Cragin" >R.Kim Cragin,'Learning to Survive:The Case of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)', in James JF Forrest (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=1R79AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA199 ''Teaching Terror: Strategic and Tactical Learning in the Terrorist World,''] [[Rowman & Littlefield]], 2006 pp.189-204 p.196.</ref><ref>Erlich Reese, [[Robert Baer]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=2gZZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 ''Conversations with Terrorists: Middle East Leaders on Politics, Violence, and Empire,''] Routledge, 2016 p.28.</ref><ref>Dunning, [https://books.google.co/books?id=4jp-CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA30  p.34].</ref> After the Al Aqsa revolt, the Brigades were behind most of the suicide bombings in Israel, a measure it defended as a form of 'reciprocity'.<ref name="auto"/>

Down to 2007, the Brigades are estimated to have lost some 800 operatives in conflicts with Israeli forces. The leadership has been consistently undermined by targeted assassinations. Aside from [[Yahya Ayyash]] (5 January 1996), it has lost [[Emad Akel]] (24 November 1993) [[Salah Shehade]], (23 July 2002), [[Ibrahim al-Makadmeh]], (8 March 2003) [[Ismail Abu Shanab]], (21 August 2003) [[Ahmed Yassin]] (March 22, 2004) and [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi]],( April 17, 2004).,<ref name ="Jefferis"/><ref name="Najib p.107"/><ref name="auto1">Harry Raymond Hueston, Paul G.

After Israel  arrested  hundreds of its members in May 1989, Hamas regionalized its command system to make its operative structure more diffuse,<ref name=Phillips/> and minimalize the chances of being detected.<ref name ="Gunning">Jeroen Gunning, 'Hamas:Harakat al-Muqamama al-Islamiyya,' in Marianne Heiberg, Brendan O'Leary, John Tirman (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=m8_pM7Ncij8C&pg=PA134 ''Terror, Insurgency, and the State: Ending Protracted Conflicts,''] [[University of Pennsylvania Press]], 2007 pp.123-155 p.134.</ref> The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades groups its fighters in 4-5 man cells, which in turn are integrated into companies and battalions.

Although the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades are an integral part of Hamas, the exact nature of the relationship is hotly debated:they appear to operate at times  independently of Hamas, exercising a certain autonomy.<ref>Joyce Davis https://books.google.com/books?id=GxwbNesHJBkC&pg=PA100 ''Martyrs: Innocence, Vengeance, and Despair in the Middle East,''  [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2004 p.100.</ref><ref name ="Herrick"/><ref>Mandaville,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=2bvcAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA282 p.282].</ref><ref name ="Levitt 2008">Matthew Levitt,[https://books.google.com/books?id=F5EmiYXQUcsC&pg=PA89 ''Negotiating Under Fire: Preserving Peace Talks in the Face of Terror Attacks,''] [[Rowman & Littlefield]] 2008 pp.89f.</ref><ref>John L.Esposito, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SlhxoTHLxeMC&pg=PA231 ''Islam and Violence,''] [[Syracuse University Press]] 1998 p.231.</ref> Some cells have independent links with the external  leadership, enabling them to bypass  the hierarchical command chain and political leadership in Gaza.<ref name ="Gunning"/> Ilana Kass and Bard O'Neill, likening Hamas's relationship with the Brigades to the political party [[Sinn Féin]]'s relationship to the military arm of the [[Irish Republican Army]]. quote a senior Hamas official as stating: "The Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigade is a separate armed military wing, which has its own leaders who do not take their orders from Hamas and do not tell us of their plans in advance." <ref name ="Kass">Ilana Kass & Bard E.

==Finances and Funding==
In the 1993 Philadelphia conference Hamas leaders's statements indicated that they read [[George H. W. Bush]]'s outline of as  [[New world order (politics)|New World Order]] as embodying a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|tacit aim]] to destroy Islam, and that therefore funding should focus on enhancing the Islamic roots of Palestinian society and promoting jihad in the occupying territories.<ref>Levitt p.148.</ref>

Hamas's budget, calculated to be (2011) roughly $US70 million, is derived in large part (85%),<ref name ="Vittori"/> from foreign, rather than internal Palestinian, sources. Only 2 Israeli-Palestinian sources figure in a list seized in 2004, while the  other contributors were donor bodies located in  Jordan, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Britain, Germany, the United States, United Arab Emirates, Italy and France. Much of the money raised comes from sources that direct their assistance to what Hamas describes as its charitable work for Palestinians, but investments in support of its ideological position are also relevant, with Persian Gulf States and Saudi Arabia prominent in the latter. Matthew Levitt states that Hamas also taps money from corporations, criminal organizations and financial networks that support terror,<ref>Levitt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=CG-AjU3rraQC&pg=PA143  pp.143-144].</ref> and is believed to engage in cigarette and drug smuggling, multimedia copyright infringement and credit card fraud.<ref name ="Vittori"/>
Vittori states that, more than other similar organizations, it is particularly careful about keeping resources for its militant, political and pu blic works activities separate.<ref name ="Vittori"/> The United States, Israel and the EU have shut down many charities and organs  that channel money to Hamas, such as the Holy Land Foundation for Relief,<ref>Colin P. Clarke,[https://books.google.com/books?id=PJRzCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 ''Terrorism, Inc.: The Financing of Terrorism, Insurgency, and Irregular Warfare: The Financing of Terrorism, Insurgency, and Irregular Warfare,''] ABC-CLIO, 2015 p.97.</ref> Between  1992-2001 this group is said to  have provided $6.8 million to Palestinian charities of the &57 million collected. By 2001 it was alleged to have given Hamas $13 million, and was shut down shortly afterwards.<ref>Interpal  and Development and the Al-Aqsa Charitable Foundation Fund  pp.&nbsp;146,154-159.</ref>

About half of Hamas's funding came from states in the Persian Gulf down to the mid 2000s. Saudi Arabia supplied half of the Hamas budget of $50 in the eary 2000s<ref name ="Burfeindt">Marsh E.Burfeindt, 'Rapprochement with Iran', in  Thomas A. Johnson

After 2006 Iran's willingness to take over the burden of the shortfall created by the drying up of Saudi funding also reflected the geopolitical tensions between the two, since, though Shiite, Iran was supporting a Sunni group traditionally closely linked with the Saudi kingdom.<ref>Lawrence Rubin,[https://books.google.com/books?id=TzeOAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA104 ''Islam in the Balance: Ideational Threats in Arab Politics,''] Stanford University Press, 2014 p.104</ref> The US imposed sanctions on Iran's Bank Saderat, alleging it had funneled hundreds of millions to Hamas.<ref>Jalil Roshandel, Alethia H.

After 2009, [[sanctions on Iran]] made funding difficult, forcing Hamas to rely on religious donations by individuals in the West Bank, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Funds, amounting to tens of millions of dollars raised in the Gulf states, were  transferred through the [[Rafah Border Crossing]]. These were not sufficient to cover the costs of governing the Strip and running the al Qassam Brigades, and when tensions arose with Iran over support of President Assad in Syria, ran dropped its financial assistance to the government, restricting its funding to the military wing, which meant a drop from $150 million in 2012 to  $60 million the following year. A further drop occurred in 2015 when Hamas expressed its criticisms of Iran's role in the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemeni Civil War]].<ref>Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA173 p.173].</ref>

===Hamas Charter (1988)===
{{main|Hamas Covenant}}
The foundational document, the  [[Hamas Charter]]  (''mīthāq ḥarakat'' 18 August 1988), declared all of Palestine [[waqf]] property endowed by God to Muslims,<ref name ="Weimann">Gabriel Weimann,[https://books.google.com/books?id=19iCbNOoYmIC&pg=PA82 ''Terror on the Internet: The New Arena, the New Challenges,'']  [[United States Institute of Peace|US Institute of Peace Press]], 2006  p.82.</ref> with religious coexistence under Islam's wing.<ref>Jim Zanotti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ajKhf9y93nkC&pg=PA15 '' Hamas: Background and Issues for Congress,''] DIANE Publishing, 2011 p.15.</ref> Like the [[Likud|Likud party platform]], it rejects a [[two-state solution]],<ref>[[Peter Beinart]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=v0U1fjErMGkC&pg=PT231 ''The Crisis of Zionism,''] Melbourne University Press 2012   p.219 n.53.</ref>  envisaging no peaceful solution to the conflict apart from [[jihad]].<ref>Zanotti, p.15.</ref><ref>Roberts [https://books.google.com/books?id=xveCBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA68 p.68 ]:'The Charter condemns world Zionism and the efforts to isolate Palestine, defines the mission of the organization, and locates that mission within Palestinian, Arab and Islamic elements. It does not condemn the West or non-Muslims, but does condemn aggression against the Palestinian people, arguing for a defensive  jihad. It also calls for fraternal relations with the other Palestinian nationalist groups'.</ref> The [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] passages,  widely cited as characterizing Hamas despite later policy changes in the organization regarding Israel,<ref>According to [[Khaled Hroub]],''Hamas: A Beginner's Guide,'' Pluto Press 2006 [https://books.google.com/books?id=-XsW4-8VVJ4C&pg=PA33 p.33]: 'The Charter was written in early 1988 by one individual and was made public without appropriate general Hamas consultation, revision or consensus, to the regret of Hamas's leaders in later years. The author of the Charter was one of the 'old guard' of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Gaza Strip, completely cut off from the outside world. All kinds of confusions and conflations between Judaism and Zionism found their way into the Charter, to the disservice of Hamas ever since, as this document has managed to brand it with charges of 'anti-Semitism' and a naïve world-view' Hamas leaders and spokespeople have rarely referred to the Charter or quoted from it, evidence that it has come to be seen as a burden rather than an intellectual platform that embraces the movement's principles.'</ref><ref>[[Khaled Hroub]], 'A "New Hamas" through its new documents', [[Journal of Palestine Studies]], vol. 35, No. 4, Summer 2006, Issue 140, pp. 6-28, p.6, cited Michael Schulz, 'Hamas Between Sharia Rule and Demo-Islam,' in Ashok Swain, Ramses Amer, Joakim Öjendal  (eds.),[https://books.google.com/books?id=cTXekQIjsLgC&pg=PA202 ''Globalization and Challenges to Building Peace,'']  pp.195-2011:'Hamas continues to be characterized with reference to its 1988 charter drawn up less than a year after the movement was established in direct response to the outbreak of the third intifada and when its raison d'être was armed resistance to the occupation.

The Charter appears to preempt the possibility of Hamas accepting the [[Two State Solution]]. The Hamas 1988 charter states that the movement's aim is to<blockquote>raise the banner of Allah over every inch of Palestine, for under the wing of Islam followers of all religions can coexist in security and safety where their lives, possessions and rights are concerned' (Article 6)<ref name="Yale">{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp|title=Hamas Covenant 1988: The Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement|accessdate=February 15, 2009|work=The Avalon Project: Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy|publisher=Yale Law School|date=August 18, 1988}}</ref><ref>Shaul Mishal, Avraham Sela,[https://books.google.com/books?id=AO-tZkbPDKYC&pg=PA178 ''The Palestinian Hamas: vision, violence, and coexistence''] Columbia University Press, 2006 p.178.</ref></blockquote>It adds that, 'when our enemies usurp some Islamic lands, jihad becomes a duty binding on all Muslims.<ref name="Tessler" >Mark A.

Decades down the line, Hamas's official position changed with regard to a two-state solution, though like the Likud platform,  its charter's [[Irredentism|irredentist]] character has not been reformulated. [[Khaled Mashaal]], its leader, has publicly affirmed the movement's readiness to accept such a division.<ref name="UWR" >David Whitten, Smith, Elizabeth Geraldine Burr, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5v-iBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA250 ''Understanding World Religions: A Road Map for Justice and Peace,''] Rowman & Littlefield, 2014 p.250</ref><ref name="Beinart" >[[Peter Beinart]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=v0U1fjErMGkC&pg=PT231  ''The Crisis of Zionism,'']  Melbourne University Press 2012 p.231:'If Israel withdraws to the borders of 1967, it doesn't mean that it gives us back all the land of the Palestinians.

[[Mousa Mohammed Abu Marzook|Mousa Marzook]] said in 2007 that the charter could not be altered because it would look like a compromise not acceptable to the 'street' and risk fracturing the party's unity. Hamas leader [[Khaled Meshaal]] has stated that the Charter is "a piece of history and no longer relevant, but cannot be changed for internal reasons".[[Ahmed Yousef]], senior adviser to [[Ismail Haniyeh]], added in 2011 that it reflected the views of the Elders in the face of a 'relentless occupation.' The details of its religious and political language had not been examined within the framework of international law, and an internal committee review to amend it was shelved out of concern not to offer concessions to Israel, as had Fatah, on a silver platter.<ref>Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 p.41]</ref> While Hamas representatives recognize the problem, one official notes that Arafat got very little in return for changing the PLO Charter under the Oslo Accords, and that there is agreement that little is gained from a non-violent approach.<ref name="Duss" >Matthew Duss, [http://tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/190832/remember-gaza 'Remember Gaza?,]' [[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet Magazine]] 8 May 2015.</ref>
Richard Davis says the dismissal by contemporary leaders of its relevance and yet the suspension of a desire to rewrite it reflects the differing constituencies Hamas must address, the domestic audience and international relations.<ref>Davis, [https://books.google.com/books?id=kGWFCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41 p.41].</ref> The charter itself is considered an 'historical relic.'<ref>Wendy Pearlman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5Rn3CgDAymEC&pg=PA137 ''Violence, Nonviolence, and the Palestinian National Movement,''] Cambridge University Press, 2011  p.137.</ref>

==Goals==
In March 2006, Hamas released its official legislative program. The document clearly signaled that Hamas could refer the issue of recognizing Israel to a national referendum. Under the heading "Recognition of Israel," it stated simply (AFP, 3/11/06): "The question of recognizing Israel is not the jurisdiction of one faction, nor the government, but a decision for the Palestinian people." This was a major shift away from their 1988 charter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=2974|title=Nixed Signals|author=Seth Ackerman|date=September–October 2006|work=Extra!|publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}</ref> A few months later, via [[University of Maryland]]'s Jerome Segal, the group sent a letter to U.S. President [[George W.

In an April 2008 meeting between Hamas leader [[Khaled Mashal]] and former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], an understanding was reached in which Hamas agreed it would respect the creation of a Palestinian state in the territory seized by Israel in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], provided this were ratified by the Palestinian people in a referendum. Hamas later publicly offered a long-term [[hudna|truce]] with Israel if Israel agreed to return to its 1967 borders and grant the "right of return" to all [[Palestinian refugee]]s.<ref>Al Jazeera, [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2008/04/2008615098393788.html "Hamas ready to accept 1967 borders"].

In February 2012, according to the Palestinian authority, Hamas forswore the use of violence.

===1990s===
Hamas carried out its first attack against Israel in 1989, abducting and killing two soldiers. The Israel Defense Forces immediately arrested Yassin and sentenced him to life in prison, and deported 400 Hamas activists, including Zahar, to [[South Lebanon]], which at the time was occupied by Israel. During this time Hamas built a relationship with [[Hezbollah]].
Hamas's military branch, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, was created in 1991.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZPQm5cQ4AwC&dq=Mehola+Junction+bombing+islamic+jihad&source=gbs_navlinks_s Martyrdom, Not Suicide: The Legality of Hamas' Bombings in the Mid-1990s in Modern Islamic Jurisprudence] By M.A. Philipp Holtmann, p. 13</ref> During the 1990s the al-Qassam Brigades conducted numerous attacks on Israel, with both civilian and military victims.

In December 1992 Israel responded to the killing of a border police officer by deporting 415 leading figures of Hamas and [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad]] to Lebanon, which provoked international condemnation and a unanimous UN Security Council resolution condemning the action.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/middle-east/2010/08/israel-palestinian-jerusalem "For Arabs in Israel, a house is not a home"] by Edward Platt, ''[[New Statesman]]'', August 30, 2010</ref><ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rWEg6Tfai_oC&dq=arafat+israel+hamas&source=gbs_navlinks_s Inside Hamas: The Untold Story of Militants, Martyrs and Spies]'' By Zaki Chehab, p. 115</ref>

According to the [[Congressional Research Service]], Hamas admitted to having executed Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israeli authorities in the 1990s. A transcript of a training film by the al-Qassam Brigades tells how Hamas operatives kidnapped Palestinians accused of collaboration and then forced confessions before executing them.<ref name="crs1993"/>

In September 1997, Israeli agents in Jordan attempted but failed to assassinate Hamas leader [[Khaled Mashal]], leading to chilled relations between the two countries and release of Sheikh Yassin, Hamas's spiritual leader, from Israeli prison.

===Second Intifada===

Al-Qassam Brigades militants were among the armed groups that launched both military-style attacks and suicide bombings against Israeli civilian and military targets during the [[Second Intifada]] (also known as the Al-Aqsa Intifada ({{lang-ar|انتفاضة الأقصى}}, ''Intifā{{transl|ar|DIN|ḍ}}at El Aq{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣ}}a''; {{lang-he|אינתיפאדת אל-אקצה}}, ''Intifādat El-Aqtzah''), which began in late September 2000. This [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied territories was much more violent than the [[First Intifada]]. The military and civilian death toll is estimated at 5500 Palestinians and more than 1100 Israelis, as well as 64 foreigners.<ref>[http://www.btselem.org/English/Statistics/Casualties.asp ''B'Tselem&nbsp;– Statistics&nbsp;– Fatalities''], [[B'Tselem]].</ref> A 2007 study of Palestinian suicide bombings during the [[second intifada]] (September 2000 through August 2005) found that about 40 percent were carried out by the al-Qassam Brigades.<ref>[http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/benmelech/files/JEP_0807.pdf "Human Capital and the Productivity of Suicide Bombers"] ''[[Journal of Economic Perspectives]]'' Volume 21, Number 3, Summer 2007. Pages 223–238</ref>

The immediate trigger for the uprising is disputed, but a more general cause, writes U.S. political science professor Jeremy Pressman, was "popular Palestinian discontent [that] grew during the Oslo peace process because the reality on the ground did not match the expectations created by the peace agreements".<ref>[http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCS/Fall03/pressman.pdf "The Second Intifada: Background and Causes of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict"] Jeremy Pressman, Fall 2003 (pdf)</ref> Hamas would be the beneficiary of this growing discontent in the 2006 Palestinian Authority legislative elections.

In January 2004, Hamas leader Sheikh [[Ahmed Yassin]] said that the group would end armed resistance against Israel in exchange for a Palestinian state in the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], and [[east Jerusalem]], and that restoring Palestinians' "historical rights" (relating to the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]]) "would be left for future generations".<ref name="Running out of time">[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/675/re1.htm Running out of time] ''Al-Ahram Weekly'' January 29&nbsp;– February 4, 2004</ref> On January 25, 2004, senior Hamas official [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] offered a 10-year truce, or ''[[hudna]]'', in return for the establishment of a Palestinian state and the complete withdrawal by Israel from the [[Green Line (Israel)|territories captured]] in the 1967 [[Six Day War]].<ref name="Running out of time"/> Al-Rantissi stated that Hamas had come to the conclusion that it was "difficult to liberate all our land at this stage, so we accept a phased liberation".<ref name="Running out of time"/><ref name="independent.co.uk">[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-rejects-insincere-hamas-offer-of-10year-truce-574542.html "Israel rejects 'insincere' Hamas offer of 10-year truce"] ''The Independent'' January 27, 2004</ref> Israel immediately dismissed al-Rantissi's statements as insincere and a smokescreen for military preparations.<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> Yassin was assassinated on March 22, 2004, by a [[targeted Israeli air strike]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3636207.stm Fury as Gaza buries Hamas leader] BBC News April 19, 2004</ref> and al-Rantisi was assassinated by a similar air strike on April 18, 2004.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3556099.stm Hamas chief killed in air strike] BBC News March 22, 2004</ref>

===2006 presidential and legislative elections===
While Hamas boycotted the [[Palestinian presidential election, 2005|2005 Palestinian presidential election]], it did participate in the [[Palestinian municipal election, 2005|2005 municipal elections]] organized by Yasser Arafat in the occupied territories. In those elections it won control of over one third of Palestinian municipal councils, besting [[Fatah]], which had for long been the biggest force in Palestinian politics.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hamas success in Fatah heartland|publisher=BBC News|date=May 13, 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4541383.stm|accessdate=January 5, 2010|first=Matthew|last=Price}}</ref>

;Electoral Platform for Change and Reform
The Change and Reform List adopts a set of principles stemming from the Islamic tradition that we embrace. We see these principles as agreed upon not only by our Palestinian people, but also by our Arab and Islamic nation as a whole. These principles are:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

# True Islam with its civilized achievements and political, economic, social, and legal aspects is our frame of reference and our way of life.
# Historic Palestine is part of the Arab and Islamic land and its ownership by the Palestinian people is a right that does not diminish over time. No military or legal measures will change that right.
# The Palestinian people, wherever they reside, constitute a single and united people and form an integral part of the Arab and Muslim nation ... [Quranic verse]. Our Palestinian people are still living a phase of national liberation, and thus they have the right to strive to recover their own rights and end the occupation using all means, including armed struggle. We have to make all our resources available to support our people and defeat the occupation and establish a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
# The right of return of all Palestinian refugees and displaced persons to their land and properties, and the right to self-determination and all other national rights, are inalienable and cannot be bargained away for any [[concession (politics)|political concessions]].
# We uphold the indigenous and inalienable rights of our people to our land, Jerusalem, our holy places, our water resources, borders, and a fully sovereign independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
# Reinforcing and protecting Palestinian national unity is one of the priorities of the Palestinian national action.
# The issue of the prisoners is at the top of the Palestinian agenda.<ref name="palestine-studies2006">{{cite journal|url=http://www.palestine-studies.org/journals.aspx?id=7087&jid=1&href=fulltext|title=A 'New Hamas' through Its New Documents|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|date=Summer 2006|volume=35|issue=4|accessdate=May 30, 2011|doi=10.1525/jps.2006.35.4.6 }}</ref>

Legislative policy and reforming the judiciary.

"stress the separation between the three powers, the legislative, executive and judicial; activate the role of the Constitutional Court; re-form the Judicial Supreme Council and choose its members by elections and on the basis of qualifications rather than partisan, personal, and social considerations ... ; enact the necessary laws that guarantee the neutrality of general prosecutor ...

Public freedoms and citizen rights.

"Achieve equality before the law among citizens in rights and duties; bring security to all citizens and protect their properties and assure their safety against arbitrary arrest, torture, or revenge; stress the culture of dialogue ... ; support the press and media institutions and maintain the right of journalists to access and to publish information; maintain freedom and independence of professional syndicates and preserve the rights of their membership".<ref name="palestine-studies2006"/>

On 8 July 2014 Israel launched [[Operation Protective Edge]] to counter increased Hamas rocket fire from Gaza. The conflict ended with a permanent cease-fire after 7 weeks, and more than 2,200 dead. 64 of the dead were Israeli soldiers, 7 were civilians in Israel (from rocket attacks), and 2,101 were killed in Gaza, of which according to UN OCHA at least 1,460 were civilians. Israel says 1,000 of the dead were militants. Following the conflict, [[Mahmoud Abbas]] president of the Palestinian Authority, accused Hamas of needlessly extending the fighting in the Gaza Strip, contributing to the high death toll, of running a "shadow government" in Gaza, and of illegally executing scores of Palestinians.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/08/world/middleeast/gaza-strip-palestinian-leader-assails-hamas-calling-unity-pact-into-question.html?_r=0 Palestinian Leader Assails Hamas, Calling Unity Pact Into Question].

In 2005, Hamas announced its intention to launch an experimental TV channel, [[Al-Aqsa TV]].

{{main|Islamization of the Gaza Strip}}
The gender ideology outlined in  the Hamas charter, the importance of women in the religious-nationalist project of liberation is asserted, while defining that role as one of manufacturing males and caring for their upbringing and rearing. This is not too different from Fatah's view of women in the First Intifada and resembles also Jewish settlers' outlook, and over time has be subject to change.<ref>Shitrit, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zUjuCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 pp.73-4].</ref><ref>Phillips, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cNq0gvBPcGQC&pg=PA81 p.81].</ref>

In 1989 to 1989, during the [[first intifada]], a small number of Hamas followers<ref>Shitrit p.74.</ref> campaigned for the wearing of the [[hijab]], which is not a part of traditional women's attire in Palestine,<ref>Gerber p.27.</ref> also insisting women stay at home and be segregated from men, polygamy.

They also cited examples of leniency by Hamas authorities, such as allowing widowed women to keep custody of their children so long as they did not remarry, and other relaxations in the enforcement of Shariah law.  One woman noted that the environment was "not as bad" as during the First Intifada, when women were subject to public criticism and stonings for failure to obey conservative Islamic standards of dress.  One woman complained that women were not free to speak their minds or travel alone, and added: "Hamas want to force themselves onto the people.

===Tayyip Erdoğan's Turkey as a role model===
Some Hamas members stated that the model of Islamic government that Hamas seeks to emulate is that of Turkey under the rule of [[Tayyip Erdoğan]].

==Antisemitism and anti-Zionism==
{{See also|Racism in the Palestinian territories}}

According to academic Esther Webman, antisemitism is not the main tenet of Hamas ideology, although antisemitic rhetoric is frequent and intense in Hamas leaflets. The leaflets generally do not differentiate between Jews and Zionists. In other Hamas publications and in interviews with its leaders attempts at this differentiation have been made.<ref name=Webman1994>Webman, Esther.

Hamas has made conflicting statements about its readiness to recognize Israel. In 2006 a spokesman signaled readiness to recognize Israel within the 1967 borders.

* Article 22 states that the [[French revolution]], the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian revolution]], colonialism and both world wars were created by the Zionists or forces supportive of Zionism:

"You may speak as much as you want about regional and world wars. They were behind World War I, when they were able to destroy the Islamic Caliphate, making financial gains and controlling resources. They obtained the Balfour Declaration, formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world. They were behind World War II, through which they made huge financial gains by trading in armaments, and paved the way for the establishment of their state. It was they who instigated the replacement of the League of Nations with the United Nations and the Security Council to enable them to rule the world through them. There is no war going on anywhere, without having their finger in it."<ref name="yale1">{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm |title=Hamas Covenant 1988|publisher=Yale|accessdate=27 May 2010}}</ref>

<blockquote>"Today it is Palestine, tomorrow it will be one country or another. The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the Nile to the Euphrates.

On August 10, 2012, Ahmad Bahr, Deputy Speaker of the Hamas Parliament, stated in a sermon that aired on ''[[Al-Aqsa TV]]'':

<blockquote>If the enemy sets foot on a single square inch of Islamic land, Jihad becomes an individual duty, incumbent on every Muslim, male or female.

In response to a statement by Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas that Hamas preferred non-violent means and had agreed to adopt "peaceful resistance," Hamas contradicted Abbas.

===Statements on the Holocaust===
Hamas has been explicit in its [[Holocaust Denial]]. In reaction to the Stockholm conference on [[The Holocaust|the Jewish Holocaust]], held in late January 2000, Hamas issued a press release that it published on its official website, containing the following statements from a senior leader:
<blockquote>This conference bears a clear Zionist goal, aimed at forging history by hiding the truth about the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no basis. (...) The invention of these grand illusions of an alleged crime that never occurred, ignoring the millions of dead European victims of Nazism during the war, clearly reveals the racist Zionist face, which believes in the superiority of the Jewish race over the rest of the nations. (...) By these methods, the Jews in the world flout scientific methods of research whenever that research contradicts their racist interests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1946 |title=Palestinian Holocaust Denial |publisher=The Washington Institute for Near East Policy |date=2000-04-21 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}</ref></blockquote> In August 2003, senior Hamas official Dr Abd Al-Aziz Al-Rantisi wrote in the Hamas newspaper ''Al-Risala'' that the Zionists encouraged murder of Jews by the Nazis with the aim of forcing them to immigrate to Palestine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajn.com.au/pages/archives/feature/feature-03a.html |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207040823/http://www.ajn.com.au:80/pages/archives/feature/feature-03a.html |archivedate=February 7, 2006 }}</ref>

In one case, an errant Israeli mortar strike killed dozens of people near a UN school. Hamas said that the mortar killed 42 people and left dozens wounded. Israel said that Hamas militants had launched a rocket from a yard adjacent to the school and one mortar of three rounds hit the school, due to a [[GPS]] error. According to the Israeli military probe, the remaining two rounds hit the yard used to launch rockets into Israel, killing two members of Hamas' military wing who fired the rockets.<ref>{{cite news |author=Amos Harel |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-investigation-shows-errant-mortar-hit-un-building-in-gaza-1.267873 |title=IDF investigation shows errant mortar hit UN building in Gaza |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref>

[[Human Right Watch]] called Hamas to "publicly renounce" the rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and hold those responsible to account. Human Right Watch program director Iain Levine said the attacks by Hamas were "unlawful and unjustifiable, and amount to war crimes", and accused Hamas of putting Palestinians at risk by launching attacks from built-up areas.<ref name="bbc1"/> Hamas spokesman relied that the report was "biased" and he denied that Hamas uses human shields.<ref name="bbc1"/>

[[Human Rights Watch]] investigated 19 incidents involving 53 civilian deaths in Gaza that Israel said were the result of Hamas fighting in densely populated areas and did not find evidence for existence of Palestinian fighters in the areas at the time of the Israeli attack. In other cases where no civilians had died, the report concluded that Hamas may have deliberately fired rockets from areas close to civilians.<ref>[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/89574/section/2 Turning a Blind Eye] [[Human Rights Watch]] April 11, 2010</ref> HRW also investigated 11 deaths that Israel said were civilians being used as human shields by Hamas.

The Israeli 'human shields' charge against Hamas was called "full of holes" by [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|''The National'' (UAE)]], which stated that only Israel accused Hamas of using human shields during the conflict, though Hamas "may be guilty" of "locating military objectives within or near densely populated areas" and for "deliberately firing indiscriminate weapons into civilian populated areas".<ref>[http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090113/FOREIGN/591536290/1011/rss "Israeli 'human shield' claim is full of holes"] [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|''The National'' (UAE)]] January 13, 2009.</ref>

One survey of Gazan residents addressed the subject of human shields during the 2014 war, with respondents issuing statements such as "People received warnings from the Israelis and tried to evacuate...Hamas shot some of those people...the rest were forced to return to their homes and get bombed"; "Hamas imposed a curfew: anyone walking out in the street was shot without being asked any questions.

===Rocket and mortar attacks===

Rocket attacks by Hamas have been condemned by Human rights organizations as [[war crime]]s, both because they usually take aim at civilians and because the weapons' inaccuracy would disproportionately endanger civilians even if military targets were chosen. After Operation Pillar of Defense, [[Human Rights Watch]] stated that armed Palestinian groups fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities, violating international humanitarian law, and that statements by Palestinian groups that they deliberately targeted Israeli civilians demonstrated an "intent to commit war crimes". HRW's Middle East director Sarah Leah Whitson said that Palestinian groups made clear that "harming civilians was their aim" and said that launching rockets at populated areas had no legal justification. International humanitarian law prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians and intentional violations can be war crimes.<ref name="HRWHamas"/>

In July 2008 [[Barack Obama]], then the Democratic presidential candidate, said: "If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my two daughters sleep at night, I'm going to do everything in my power to stop that, and I would expect Israelis to do the same thing."<ref>Steven Lee Myers and Helene Cooper, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/washington/29diplo.html Obama Defers to Bush, for Now, on Gaza Crisis], New York Times December 28, 2009</ref> On December 28, 2008, Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] said in a statement: "the United States strongly condemns the repeated rocket and mortar attacks against Israel."<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473167,00.html U.S. Condemns Hamas in Midst of Israeli Strikes], Fox News December 28, 2008</ref> On March 2, 2009, Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] condemned the attacks.<ref>[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gid-B97gmhLgqf8brVLEKN46E-Lw Clinton calls for 'durable' Gaza truce, condemns rockets], AFP March 2, 2009</ref>

===Children===

====Children and women as human shields====
Israel has accused Hamas of using children as [[human shield]]s. The Israeli government released video footage in which it claims two militants are shown grabbing a young boy's arm from behind holding him to walk in front of them toward a group of people waiting near a wall. The IDF argues the militants were placing the boy between themselves and an Israeli sniper. The second scene shows an individual, described as a terrorist, grabbing a school boy off of a floor, where he is hiding behind a column from IDF fire, and using him as a human shield to walk to a different location.<ref>[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=58&ar=HamasExploitationofCiviliansV&ak=null "IDF Video: Hamas uses civilians as a means to achieving military goals".] 2009.

After 15 alleged militants sought refuge in a mosque from Israeli forces, the BBC reported that Hamas radio instructed local women to go the mosque to protect the militants. Two women were later killed when Israeli forces opened fire.<ref name=HRWDec16/>

In November 2006, the Israeli Air Force warned Muhammad Weil Baroud, commander of the [[Popular Resistance Committees]] who are accused of launching rockets into Israeli territory, to evacuate his home in a Jabalya refugee camp <!-- While most sources say Beit Lahiya, the home was actually in the Jabalya refugee camp in the city of Jabalia, which is adjacent to Beit Lahiya --> apartment block in advance of a planned Israeli air strike. Baroud responded by calling for volunteers to protect the apartment block and nearby buildings and, according to ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', hundreds of local residents, mostly women and children, responded. Israel suspended the air strike. Israel termed the action an example of Hamas using human shields.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6162494.stm Human shield deters Israel strike] [[BBC News]] November 19, 2006</ref> In response to the incident, Hamas proclaimed: 'We won.

They stated that, on the basis of available evidence, the home demolition was in fact an administrative act, viewed in the context of Israel's longstanding policy of punitive home demolitions, not a military act and thus would not fall within the purview of the law regulating hostilities during armed conflict, which had been the basis for their initial criticism of Hamas.<ref name=HRWDec16>{{cite web|title=Human Rights Watch Statement on our November 22 Press Release|url=http://www.hrw.org/news/2006/12/15/human-rights-watch-statement-our-november-22-press-release|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2012-11-20}}</ref>

When the UN-sponsored [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|Goldstone Commission Report on the Gaza War]] was commissioned in 2009, it stated that it "found no evidence that Palestinian combatants mingled with the civilian population with the intention of shielding themselves from attack" though they deemed credible reports that Palestinian militants were "not always dressed in a way that distinguished them from civilians".<ref>{{cite web|author1=[[Human Rights Council]]|title=Human Rights in Palestine and Other Occupied Arab Territories: Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|url=http://www.unrol.org/files/UNFFMGC_Report.pdf|website=unrol.org|publisher=[[United Nations]]|accessdate=3 June 2015|page=147|format=PDF|date=15 September 2009}}</ref>

====Children as combatants====
The Israeli government released a video compiled mostly from Arab news sources showing Palestinian children under the age of 15 going through military training and carrying and firing arms. The video's narration explains that Hamas indoctrinates these child combatants and that Hamas operators send the children "on missions from which they would not risk their own lives". According to the Israeli government, the children are used as spotters, to transport explosives and weapons, sent to play in areas to deter Israeli attacks and are sent unknowingly with explosive devices in their schoolbags to be blown up in the vicinity of Israelis.<ref>[http://switch3.castup.net/cunet/gm.asp?ai=58&ar=HamasExploitationofCiviliansV&ak=null "Video: Hamas uses civilians as a means to achieving military goals".] 2009.

See [[Military use of children]].

Although Hamas admits to sponsoring summer schools to train teenagers in handling weapons they condemn attacks by children. Following the deaths of three teenagers during a 2002 attack on [[Netzarim (settlement)|Netzarim]] in central Gaza, Hamas banned attacks by children and "called on the teachers and religious leaders to spread the message of restraint among young boys".<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79948&page=1 Youths' Suicide Mission Stuns Palestinians] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] April 25, 2002</ref><ref>[http://middleeastfacts.com/Articles/teenage-suicide-bombers.php Teenage Suicide Bombers] MEF 2002</ref>

====Children's magazine====
{{main|Al-Fateh}}
Al-Fateh ("the conqueror") is the Hamas children's magazine, published biweekly in London, and also posted in an online website. It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid-September 2007. The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles, and states it is for "the young builders of the future".<ref name="OnlineTerrorists">{{cite web|url=http://globalpolitician.com/24252-terror |title=Online Terrorists Prey on the Vulnerable |publisher=Globalpolitician.com |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref>

According to [[MEMRI]] (three of whose seven founding staff had formerly served in the IDF), the magazine includes incitement to jihad and martyrdom and glorification of terrorist operations and of their planners and perpetrators. as well as characterizations of Jews as "murderers of the prophets" and laudatory descriptions of parents who encourage their sons to kill Jews. In each issue, a regular feature titled "The Story of a Martyr" presents the "heroic deeds" of a [[mujahid]] from one of the organizations who died in a suicide operation, including operations against civilians, or who was killed by the IDF. MEMRI also noted that the magazine includes illustrations of figures, including child warriors, who embody the ethos of jihad and martyrdom, presenting them as role models. These include the magazine's titular character, Al-Fateh ("The Conqueror")—a small boy on a horse brandishing a drawn scimitar—as well as children carrying guns, and photos of Hamas fighters launching Qassam rockets.<ref name="memri.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&Area=ia&ID=IA39307 |title=Hamas Children's Magazine Al-Fateh Encourages Terrorism, Glorifies Martyrdom |publisher=Memri.org |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/main_Terrorism/al_fateh_hamas.htm |title=Hamas Magazine for Kids Promotes Martyrdom and Hatred |publisher=Adl.org |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref>

On August 2, 2012, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] (IFJ) accused Hamas of harassing elected officials belong to the Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate (PJS) in Gaza. The IFJ said that journalists' leaders in Gaza have faced a campaign of intimidation, as well as threats designed to force them to stop their union work. Some of these journalists are now facing charges of illegal activities and a travel ban, due to their refusal "to give in to pressure". The IFJ said that these accusations are "malicious" and "should be dropped immediately". The IFJ explained that the campaign against PJS members began in March 2012, after their election, and included a raid organized by Hamas supporters who took over the PJS offices in Gaza with the help of the security forces, and subsequently evicted the staff and elected officials. Other harassment includes the targeting of individuals who were bullied into stopping union work. The IFJ backed the PJS and called on Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh to intervene to stop "his officials' unwarranted interference in journalists' affairs".<ref name="IFJ August">{{cite web | url=http://www.ifj.org/en/articles/ifj-condemns-hamas-meddling-in-gaza-journalists-affairs | title=IFJ Condemns Hamas Meddling in Gaza Journalists' Affairs | publisher=International Federation of Journalists | date=August 2, 2012 | accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref>

In June 2011, the Independent Commission for Human Rights based in [[Ramallah]] published a report whose findings included that the Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were subjected in 2010 to an "almost systematic campaign" of human rights abuses by the [[Palestinian Authority]] and Hamas, as well as by Israeli authorities, with the security forces belonging to the PA and Hamas being responsible for torture, arrests and arbitrary detentions.<ref>{{cite news |last=Liel |first=Alon |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=224143 |title='PA bans journalists from reporting human rights abuses' |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=August 1, 2011}}</ref>

In 2012, the [[Human Rights Watch]] presented a 43 page long list of human rights violation committed by Hamas. Among actions attributed to Hamas the HRW report mentions beatings with metal clubs and rubber hoses, hanging of alleged collaborationists with Israel, and torture of 102 individuals. According to the report, Hamas also tortured civil society activists and peaceful protesters. Reflecting on the captivity of [[Gilad Shalit]], the HRW report described it as "cruel and inhuman". The report also slams Hamas for harassment of people based on so called morality offenses and for media censorship.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4288204,00.html |title=Rights group: Hamas abusing Palestinians in Gaza|publisher=Ynetnews.com |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/world-report-2012/world-report-2012-israeloccupied-palestinian-territories |title=World Report 2012: Israel/Occupied Palestinian Territories |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=January 22, 2012 |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref> In a public statement [[Joe Stork]], the deputy Middle East director of HRW claimed, "after five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights and grants impunity to abusive security services."

On May 26, 2015 Amnesty International released a report saying that Hamas carried out extrajudicial killings, abductions and arrests of Palestinians and used the Al-Shifa Hospital to detain, interrogate and torture suspects during the Israel–Gaza conflict in 2014.

==Violence and terrorism==
{{Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel}}
Hamas uses both political activities and violence in pursuit of its goals. For example, while politically engaged in the 2006 Palestinian Territories parliamentary election campaign, Hamas stated in its election manifesto that it was prepared to use "armed resistance to end the occupation".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stockholmsfria.nu/artikel/6296|title= Islamistisk politik vinner mark|author=Madelene Axelsson|date=January 27, 2006|publisher=[[Stockholms Fria Tidning]]|language=sv}}</ref>

From 2000 to 2004, Hamas was responsible for killing nearly 400 Israelis and wounding more than 2,000 in 425 attacks, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 2001 through May 2008, Hamas launched more than 3,000 Qassam rockets and 2,500 mortar attacks into Israel.<ref name="fox1">[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,473448,00.html Israel At 'War to the Bitter End,' Strikes Key Hamas Sites] December 29, 2008, Fox News</ref>

===Rocket attacks on Israel===
According to Human Rights Watch, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups have launched thousands of rockets into Israel since 2001, killing 15 civilians, wounding many more, and posing an ongoing threat to the nearly 800,000 Israeli civilians who live and work in the weapons' range. Hamas officials have said that the rockets were aimed only at military targets, saying that civilian casualties were the "accidental result" of the weapons' poor quality. According to Human Rights Watch, statements by Hamas leaders suggest that the purpose of the rocket attacks was indeed to strike civilians and civilian objects. From January 2009, following [[Operation Cast Lead]], Hamas largely stopped launching rocket attacks on Israel and has on at least two occasions arrested members of other groups who have launched rockets, "showing that it has the ability to impose the law when it wants".<ref>[http://www.hrw.org/en/node/89574/section/3 HRW report] April 11, 2010</ref> In February 2010, Hamas issued a statement regretting any harm that may have befallen Israeli civilians as a result of Palestinian rocket attacks during the Gaza war. It maintained that its rocket attacks had been aimed at Israeli military targets but lacked accuracy and hence sometimes hit civilian areas. Israel responded that Hamas had boasted repeatedly of targeting and murdering civilians in the media.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Al-Mughrabi, Nidal|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKLDE6141LC|title=Hamas "regrets" civilian deaths, Israel unmoved|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=February 5, 2010}}</ref>

===Attempts to derail 2010 peace talks===
{{see also|2010 Palestinian militancy campaign}}

In 2010, Hamas, who have been actively sidelined from the peace talks by Israel, spearheaded a coordinated effort by 13 [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] militant groups, in attempt to derail the stalled [[Direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in 2010|peace talks]] between Israel and [[Mahmoud Abbas]], President of the [[Palestinian Authority]]. According to the Israeli [[Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories]] Major Gen. Eitan Dangot, Israel seeks to work with [[Salam Fayyad]], to help revive the Palestinian economy, and hopes to ease restrictions on the Gaza Strip further, "while somehow preventing the Islamic militants who rule it from getting credit for any progress".

===Themes of martyrdom===
{{See also|Martyrdom in Islam}}

According to a translation by Palestinian Media Watch, in 2008, Fathi Hamad, a member of the [[Palestinian Legislative Council]], stated on [[Al-Aqsa TV]], "For the Palestinian people death became an industry, at which women excel and so do all people on this land: the elderly excel, the Jihad fighters excel, and the children excel. Accordingly (Palestinians) created a human shield of women, children, the elderly and the Jihad fighters against the Zionist bombing machine, as if they were saying to the Zionist enemy: 'We desire death as you desire life.'"<ref>[http://www.palwatch.org/main.aspx?fi=582&doc_id=507 "Hamas explains using civilians as human shields"], ''[[Palestinian Media Watch]]'', (December 28, 2008).</ref>

In 2010, Hamas speaker Ahmad Bahr praised the virtues of martyrdom and Jihad, and said that 2.5 million black-eyed virgins were waiting in the [[Garden of Eden]], which could be entered only by prophets, by the righteous, and by martyrs.

The latter include standard [[RPG-7]] warheads and home-made rockets such as the [[Al-Bana]], Al-[[Batar]] and Al-[[Yasin (RPG)|Yasin]]. The IDF has a difficult, if not impossible time trying to find hidden weapons caches in Palestinian areas — this is due to the high local support base Hamas enjoys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humanities.uci.edu/history/levineconference/papers/aburaiya.pdf#search=%22hamas%20enjoys%20great%20popular%20support%22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605021001/http://www.humanities.uci.edu/history/levineconference/papers/aburaiya.pdf#search=%22hamas%20enjoys%20great%20popular%20support%22|archivedate=June 5, 2007|author=Issam Aburaiya|date=October 3, 2006|title=Hamas and Palestinian Nationalism}}</ref>

According to Palestinian president [[Mahmoud Abbas]], during [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], Hamas killed more than 120 Palestinian youths for defying house arrest imposed on them by Hamas, in addition to 30-40 Palestinians killed by Hamas in extrajudicial executions after accusing them of being collaborators with Israel.<ref>"More than 120 youths were killed by Hamas because they did not abide by the house arrest imposed on them.

====Debate whether to attack America====
Hamas officials have publicly debated whether or not to attack American interests in the Middle East in response to US support of [[Mahmoud Abbas]] preceding the 2006 Gaza elections.<ref>Klein, Aaron. [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3343944,00.html "Hamas threatens attacks on US: Terrorist warns 'Middle East is full of American targets'."] ''Ynet News''. December 24, 2006. Accessed July 20, 2014.</ref>

==International support==

Hamas has always maintained leadership abroad. The movement is deliberately fragmented to ensure that Israel cannot kill its top political and military leaders.<ref name="theatlantic.com">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/06/how-hamas-lost-the-arab-spring/277102/</ref> Hamas used to be strongly allied with both Iran and Syria. Iran gave Hamas an estimated $13–15 million in 2011 as well as access to long-range missiles. Hamas’ political bureau was once located in the Syrian capital of Damascus before the start of the Syrian civil war. Relations between Hamas, Iran, and Syria began to turn cold when Hamas refused to back the government of Syrian President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Instead, Hamas backed the Sunni rebels fighting against Assad. As a result, Iran cut funding to Hamas and their terror proxy Hezbollah ordered Hamas members out of Lebanon.<ref name="time.com">http://time.com/3033681/hamas-gaza-palestine-israel-egypt/</ref> Hamas was then forced out of Syria. Since then, Iran and Hezbollah have tried to mend fences with Hamas.<ref name="time.com"/> Hamas contacted Jordan and Sudan to see if either would open up its borders to its political bureau. But both countries refused - though they welcomed many Hamas members leaving Syria.<ref name="al-monitor.com">http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/04/hamas-qatar-relationship-independence.html#</ref> In 2012 Hamas headquarters subsequently moved to Doha, Qatar.<ref name="stopterrorfinance.org">http://stopterrorfinance.org/blog/510641507-is-gaza-reconstruction-aid-rearming-hamas</ref>

From 2012-2013, under the leadership of Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Morsi, Hamas had the support of Egypt. However, when Morsi was removed from Office, his replacement [[Abdul Fattah al-Sisi]] outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood and destroyed the tunnels Hamas built into Egypt. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are likewise hostile to Hamas. Like Egypt, they designated the Brotherhood as a terrorist organization and Hamas was viewed as its Palestinian equivalent.<ref name="time.com"/>

===Qatar and Turkey===
According to Middle East experts, now Hamas has two firm allies: Qatar and Turkey. Both give Hamas public and financial assistance estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Shashank Joshi, Senior Research Fellow at the [[Royal United Services Institute]] says that “Qatar also hosts Hamas’ political bureau which includes Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.” Meshaal also visits Turkey frequently to meet with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan.<ref name="time.com"/> Erdogan has dedicated himself to breaking Hamas out of its political and economic seclusion. Last year on U.S. television Erdogan said, "I don't see Hamas as a terror organization. Hamas is a political party."<ref name="theatlantic.com"/>

In 2007, Qatar was, with Turkey, the only country to back Hamas after the group ousted the Palestinian Authority out of the Gaza Strip.<ref name="time.com"/> The relationship between Hamas and Qatar strengthened in 2008 and 2009 when Khaled Meshaal was invited to attend the Doha Summit where he was seated next to the then Qatari Emir [[Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani]] who pledged $250 million to repair the damage caused by the Israel in the Israeli war on Gaza.<ref name="al-monitor.com"/> These events caused Qatar to become the main player in the “Palestinian issue.” Qatar called Gaza’s blockade unjust and immoral, which prompted the Hamas government in Gaza, including former Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh, to thank Qatar for their “unconditional” support. Qatar then began regularly handing out political, material, humanitarian and charitable support for Hamas.<ref name="al-monitor.com"/>

In 2012, Qatar’s former Emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, became the first head of state to visit Gaza under Hamas rule. He pledged to raise $400 million for reconstruction. Some have argued that the money Qatar gives to reconstruct Palestine is an excuse to pour even more money into Hamas.<ref name="stopterrorfinance.org"/> Qatar’s reason for funding Hamas, which is shared by Recep Tayyip Erdogan, is allegedly that Islamist groups are growing and will eventually play a role in the region; thus it is important for Qatar (and Turkey) to maintain ties. During the Arab Spring, for example, Qatar backed the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Islamist group whose offshoot is Hamas.<ref name="jta.org">http://www.jta.org/2014/09/14/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/why-does-qatar-support-hamas</ref> Other sources say that advocating for Hamas is politically beneficial to Turkey and Qatar because the Palestinian cause draws popular support amongst their citizens at home.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/06/world/meast/mideast-hamas-support/</ref>

Some began to label Qatar a terrorist haven in part because it is harboring Hamas leader Meshaal.<ref name="jta.org"/> They also harbor Husam Badran former leader of Hamas’ military wing in the northern West Bank.<ref>https://bbcwatch.org/tag/husam-badran/</ref> [[Husam Badran]], current media spokesman for Hamas, was the instigator of several of the deadliest suicide bombings of the [[Second Intifada|second intifada]] including the [[Dolphinarium discotheque massacre|Dolphinarium discotheque bombing]] in Tel Aviv which killed 21 people.<ref>http://www.jta.org/2011/10/18/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/murderers-row-who-are-the-terrorists-being-freed-in-the-shalit-deal</ref>

Turkey has also been criticized for housing terrorists like [[Saleh al-Arouri]], the senior Hamas officer known for his ability to mastermind attacks from abroad. Al-Arouri is alleged to have orchestrated the June 2014 abduction and killing of three Israeli teenagers and to have started the 50 days war between Israel and Palestine and now lived in Turkey.<ref>http://stopterrorfinance.org/blog/510702345-a-rising-terror-threat-hamas-underground-tunnels-and-remote-control</ref>

Speaking in reference to Qatar’s support for Hamas, during a 2015 visit to Palestine, Qatari official Mohammad al-Emadi, said Qatar is using the money not to help Hamas but rather the Palestinian people as a whole. He acknowledges however that giving to the Palestinian people means using Hamas as the local contact. Emadi said, "You have to support them. You don't like them, don't like them. But they control the country, you know." <ref>http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/06/18/414693807/why-israel-lets-qatar-give-millions-to-hamas</ref> Some argue that Hamas’ relations with Qatar are putting Hamas in an awkward position because Qatar has become part of the regional Arab problem.

But Hamas claims that having contacts with various Arab countries establishes positive relations which will encourage Arab countries to do their duty toward the Palestinians and support their cause by influencing public opinion in the Arab world.<ref name="al-monitor.com"/>

===U.S.-based support===
Several U.S. organizations were either shut down or held liable for financing Hamas in early 2001, groups that have origins from the mid-1990s: the [[Holy Land Foundation]] (HLF), [[Islamic Association for Palestine]] (IAP), and [[Kind Hearts]]. The U.S. Treasury Department specially designated the HLF in 2001 for terror ties: from 1995-2001. The HLF transferred “approximately $12.4 million outside of the United States with the intent to contribute funds, goods, and services to Hamas.” According to the Treasury Department, Khaled Meshal, identified one of HLF’s officers, Mohammed El-Mezain as “the Hamas leader for the U.S.” In 2003, IAP was found liable for financially supporting Hamas, and in 2006 Kind Hearts had their assets frozen for supporting Hamas.<ref>http://www.thetower.org/3260oc-former-treasury-official-same-network-that-funded-hamas-in-u-s-backs-boycotts-of-israel/</ref> In 2016 it was reported that the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement (BDS) against Israel includes a web of Hamas supporters from the Illinois-based organization [[American Muslims for Palestine]] (AMP).<ref>http://www.timesofisrael.com/congressional-testimony-highlights-ties-between-hamas-linked-charities-bds/</ref>
