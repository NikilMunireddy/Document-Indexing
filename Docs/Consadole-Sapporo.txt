League|date=20 November 2015|accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref> is a Japanese professional [[football club]], which plays in the [[J2 League]]. The team is based in [[Sapporo, Hokkaido|Sapporo]], on the island of [[Hokkaido]].

The club name of "Consadole" is made from ''consado'', a reverse of the Japanese word {{Nihongo|''Dosanko''|道産子||meaning "people of Hokkaido"}} and the Spanish expression ''Ole''.

Unlike other teams, their main home ground at [[Sapporo Dome]] is also used by the [[Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters]] baseball team, so some home games are moved to [[Sapporo Atsubetsu Park Stadium]].

==History==

===Toshiba S.C. (1935–1995)===
Consadole's club tradition dates back to 1935 when '''[[Toshiba]] Horikawa-cho Soccer Club''' was founded in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa]]. They were promoted to the now-defunct [[Japan Soccer League]] Division 2 in 1978.<ref name="jleague">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jleague.jp/club/sapporo/#profile|title=北海道コンサドーレ札幌 プロフィール|trans_title=Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo; Club profile|language=Japanese|publisher=J. League|accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref> They adopted new name '''Toshiba Soccer Club''' in 1980 and were promoted to the JSL Division 1 in 1989.<ref name="jleague" /> Relegating themselves as they were not ready for J. League implementation, they joined the newly formed [[Japan Football League (former)|Japan Football League]] in 1992 and played the last season as Toshiba S.C. in 1995.<ref name="jleague" />

They sought to be a professional club but the owner Toshiba did not regard Kawasaki as an ideal hometown. This was because [[Tokyo Verdy 1969|Verdy Kawasaki]], one of the most prominent clubs at that time, was also based in the city, which Toshiba apparently believed was not big enough to accommodate two clubs. (Verdy has since crossed the [[Tama River]] to be based in [[Chōfu, Tokyo|Chōfu City]] in the west of Tokyo and has been renamed as Tokyo Verdy 1969; the only remaining professional club is [[Kawasaki Frontale]], originally part of [[Fujitsu]].)

They decided to move to Sapporo where the local government and community had been keen to provide a base for a professional soccer team as they awaited [[Sapporo Dome]] to be completed in 2001. The ownership was transferred from Toshiba to Hokkaido Football Club plc. before the start of the 1996 season.<ref name="jleague" />

Toshiba does not have financial interest in the club any more but Consadole still boasts their forerunner's red and black colours on their uniform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hbc.co.jp/tv/burai/back0903.html|title=中村美彦の無頼放談|trans_title=A random talk with Yoshihiko Nakamura|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Hokkaido Broadcasting]]|accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>

===Consadole Sapporo (1996– )===
Consadole Sapporo inherited the JFL status from Toshiba S.C.. Their debut season in 1996 was not overly successful as they finished 5th and missed promotion. However, they won the JFL championship in 1997 and were promoted to J. League.<ref name="jleague" />

In 1998, their first J. League season saw them finish 14th out of 18 but this did not guarantee them staying up. From the 1999 season, the J. League had 2 divisions and the play-offs involving five teams (four J. League sides and the champions of the JFL) were to be played. In order to decide who were involved in the play-offs, not only the results of the 1998 season but also those of the 1997 were taken account of. Consadole, who did not play in the previous season, was placed 14th in the aggregate standing and despite finishing above [[Gamba Osaka]] (who had finished 4th in 1997), was forced to face the play-offs. They lost all four games, two against [[Vissel Kobe]], and another two against [[Avispa Fukuoka]], and became the first-ever J. League side that experienced relegation.<ref name="japantimes">{{Cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2008/03/06/soccer/j-league/consadole-shoot-for-immediate-success-in-top-division/|title=Consadole shoot for immediate success in top division|publisher=Japan Times|date=6 March 2008||accessdate=3 February 2016}}</ref>

In 1999, [[Takeshi Okada]], the former [[Japan national football team|Japan national team]] coach, was appointed as head coach in an effort to make an immediate comeback to J1, but this attempt failed as they finished 5th. Their heavy investment on players counted against them and, at this point, the debt owed by the club exceeded 3 billion yen (33 million USD). The bankruptcy looked a near-certainty.

In 2000, they cut costs dramatically. As a result, the team often included as many as eight on-loan players in the starting line-up. However, this strategy paid off and the club won the J2 championship as well as promotion to J1. The club posted a single-year profit for the first time in their history this year.

In 2001, they finished 11th in J1. However, at the end of the season, the club failed to persuade Okada to renew the contract and several leading players also left the club. In 2002, they finished bottom and were relegated to J2 for a second time.<ref name="japantimes" />

In 2003, they again tried to return to the top-flight immediately by investing heavily but the team didn't perform well on the pitch. They finished 9th and their debt again crossed the 3 billion yen mark.

The deficit-ridden club realized they needed a drastic restructuring and released highly paid leading players including mainstay [[Yasuyuki Konno]]. The rejuvenated but inexperienced team finished bottom of J2 in 2004. The bright side was their improved financial situation where the debt was sharply reduced to less than 100 million yen.

In 2005 and 2006, they finished 6th. In 2007 they finally earned promotion as champions and play in J1 in the 2008 season.<ref name="japantimes" />

A loss on October 19, 2008 confirmed Sapporo's relegation to J2 for the 2009 season, overtaking Kyoto Sanga as the league's [[yo-yo club|most relegated side]]. Having won the [[List of winners of J2 and predecessors|Japanese second-tier championship]] a record 5 times (including two JSL Second Divisions as Toshiba, and one former JFL title), they were promoted to Division One after finishing third in 2011. However, a torrid 2012 season ended with Consadole holding the highest goals conceded per game ratio, the worst points per game ratio and the highest loss percentage in J.League history as they were relegated after just 27 matches played, making the 2012 team one of the worst to have ever featured in the top division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jleague.co.uk/2012/12/02/consadole-sapporo-the-worst-team-in-j-league-history-updated|title=Consadole Sapporo: The worst team in J.League history}}</ref>
