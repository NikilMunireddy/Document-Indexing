The title '''Hero of the Soviet Union''' ({{lang-ru|''Герой Советского Союза''}}, ''Geroy Sovietskogo Soyuza'') was the highest distinction in the [[Soviet Union]], awarded personally or collectively for heroic feats in service to the Soviet state and society.<ref name=GSEncy>{{Cite book  | last = Prokhorov  | first = Aleksandr Mikhaĭlovich | authorlink = Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov | title = Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Volume 6 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1982 | location = New York  | pages = 594 | url =  | doi =  | id =  | isbn =  | oclc = 810278 }}</ref>

==Overview==
The award was established on May 5, 1934, by the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]].<ref name="sovietresolution">{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union of May 5, 1934 | publisher = Wikisource | date= 2010-09-04 |url =  http://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5_%D0%A6%D0%98%D0%9A_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0_%D0%BE%D1%82_16.05.1934_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0 | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-20 }}</ref>  The first recipients of the title originally received only the [[Order of Lenin]], the highest Soviet award, along with certificate (грамота, ''gramota'') describing the heroic deed from the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the USSR. Because the Order of Lenin could be awarded for deeds not qualifying for the title of hero, and to distinguish heroes from other Order of Lenin holders, the [[Gold Star medal]] was introduced on August 1, 1939.<ref name="sovietdecree1939">{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of August 1, 1939 | publisher = Wikisource | date= 2011-09-28 |url =  http://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%A3%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7_%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%83%D0%BC%D0%B0_%D0%92%D0%A1_%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0_%D0%BE%D1%82_1.08.1939_%D0%BE_%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D1%85_%D0%B7%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%85_%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F_%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%B2_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%B7%D0%B0 | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-20 }}</ref> Earlier heroes were retroactively eligible for these items.

A hero could be awarded the title again for a subsequent heroic feat with an additional Gold Star medal and certificate. An additional Order of Lenin was not given until 1973. The practice of awarding the title multiple times was abolished by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] in 1988 during [[perestroika]].

44 foreign citizens were awarded the title.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Статистика :: Герои страны|url = http://www.warheroes.ru/stats.asp|website = www.warheroes.ru|access-date = 2016-01-25|language = Russian|trans-title = Statistics}}</ref>

The title was also given posthumously, though often without the actual Gold Star medal given.

The title could be revoked only by the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]].<ref>McDaniel and Schmitt, ''The Comprehensive Guide to Soviet Orders and Medals''.</ref>

==History==
[[File:Zhukov 1945 E010750410-v8.jpg|thumb|Marshal Georgy Zhukov (center) wearing three Hero of the Soviet Union medals and Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky (right) wearing two]]
The total number of persons who were awarded this title is 12,755 (twenty people have been stripped of this title due to various circumstances). The great majority of them received it during [[World War II]] (11,635 Heroes of the Soviet Union, 101 twice Heroes, three thrice Heroes, and two four-time Heroes). Sixty-five people were awarded the title for actions related to the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet-Afghan War]], which lasted from 1979 until 1989.<ref>http://faculty.winthrop.edu/haynese/medals/afghan/af_hsu.html</ref>

The first recipients of the award were the pilots [[Anatoly Vasilyevich Liapidevsky|Anatoly Liapidevsky]] (certificate number one), [[Sigizmund Levanevsky]], [[Vasily Molokov]], [[Mavriky Slepnyov]], [[Nikolai Kamanin]], [[Ivan Doronin]] and [[Mikhail Vasilyevich Vodopianov|Mikhail Vodopianov]], who participated in the successful aerial search and rescue of the crew of the steamship ''[[Cheliuskin (ship)|Cheliuskin]]'', which sank in [[Arctic]] waters, crushed by ice fields, on February 13, 1934. [[Valentina Grizodubova]], a female pilot, was the first woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union (November 2, 1938)<ref>{{ru icon}} [http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=651 Гризодубова Валентина Степановна]</ref> for her international women's record for a straight-line distance flight. [[Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya]], a [[Soviet partisan]], was the first woman to become a Hero of the Soviet Union during World War II (February 16, 1942), posthumously.

In addition, 101 people received the award twice. A second award entitled the recipient to have a bronze bust of his or her likeness with a commemorative inscription erected in his or her hometown.

Two famous Soviet fighter pilots, [[Aleksandr Ivanovich Pokryshkin|Aleksandr Pokryshkin]] and [[Ivan Nikitovich Kozhedub|Ivan Kozhedub]] were three times Heroes of the Soviet Union. A third award entitled the recipient to have his/her bronze bust erected on a columnar pedestal in Moscow, near the [[Palace of the Soviets]], but the Palace was never built.

After his release from serving a 20-year sentence in a Mexican prison for the assassination of [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Ramon Mercader]] moved to the Soviet Union in 1961 and was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal from KGB head [[Alexander Shelepin]].

The only individuals to receive the title four times were Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. The original statute of the Hero of the Soviet Union, however, did not provide for a fourth title; its provisions allowed for a maximum of three awards regardless of later deeds. Both Zhukov and Brezhnev received their fourth titles under controversial circumstances contrary to the statute, which remained largely unchanged until the award was abolished in 1991. Zhukov was awarded a fourth time "for his large accomplishments" on the occasion of his 60th birthday on December 1, 1956. There is some speculation that Zhukov's fourth Hero medal was for his participation in the arrest of [[Lavrentiy Beria|Beria]] in 1953, but this was not entered in the records. Brezhnev's four awards further eroded the prestige of the award because they were birthday gifts, on the occasions of his 60th, 70th, 72nd and 75th birthdays. Such practices halted in 1988 due to a decision of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, which formally ended it.

By the 1970s, the award had been somewhat devalued. Important political and military persons had been awarded on the occasions of their anniversaries rather than for any immediate heroic activity.

All Soviet [[cosmonaut]]s, starting from [[Yuri Gagarin]], as well as foreign citizens who participated in Soviet cosmic program as cosmonauts, received Hero award for each flight (but no more than twice).

Apart from individuals, the title was also awarded to twelve cities ([[Hero City]]) as well as the fortress of [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] ([[Hero-Fortress]]) for collective heroism during the War.

The last recipient of the title "Hero of the Soviet Union" was a Soviet [[underwater diving|diver]], [[Corvette Captain|Captain of the 3rd rank]] [[Leonid Solodkov|Leonid Mikhailovich Solodkov]] on December 24, 1991 for his leadership and participation in a series of unprecedented extreme depth diving experiments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aarticles.net/biographies/1306-kak-leonid-solodkov-stal-poslednim-geroem-sovetskogo-soyuza.html|title= As Leonid Solodkov was the last hero of the Soviet Union?|publisher=|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref> Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, this title was succeeded in Russia by the title "[[Hero of the Russian Federation]]", in Ukraine by "[[Hero of Ukraine]]" and in Belarus by "[[Hero of Belarus]]". Azerbaijan's successor order is that of [[National Hero of Azerbaijan]] and Armenia's own hero medal is that of [[National Hero of Armenia]], both modeled on the Soviet one.
