'''Hull Kingston Rovers''' (also known as '''Hull KR''') is an English professional [[rugby league football]] club based in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], England. The club formed in 1882 and currently competes in [[Super League]], having won promotion from [[Rugby League National Leagues|National League One]] in 2006. Hull Kingston Rovers are one of two professional rugby league teams in the city along with [[Hull F.C.]], who play in the western side of the city, while Hull KR are based in the eastern side at Craven Park. The [[River Hull]] is usually seen as the divide between the two clubs in the city. Hull KR's nickname is ''"the Robins"'' which originates from their traditional playing colours<ref name=HKRaboutus1>{{cite web | author =Hull Kingston Rovers RLFC | title = About Us | work = Official website | publisher = Hull Kingston Rovers RLFC| year = 2009| url = http://www.hullkr.co.uk/page.php?id=68| accessdate =12 July 2009}}</ref> of red and white.

Leagues were again suspended during the [[Second World War]].

In 1961-62, the club won 17 successive matches and finished 8th out of 30.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/> In 1962, the league was split into East and West of the Pennines; Huddersfield and Hull Kingston Rovers met at Headingley, Leeds in the first final of the [[Rugby league county leagues|Eastern Division]] Championship on Saturday 10 November 1962.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/> Reigning champions, Huddersfield were favourites to lift the Eastern Division title, especially as Rovers were missing five first choice players with injuries. The Robins, however, set the early pace and were 10–0 up after 30 minutes. Despite a rally by Huddersfield, Rovers hung on to win 13–10. Rovers win was their first trophy for more than 30 years. In 1962-63 as two division rugby returned, they finished the season tenth out of sixteen in Division 1.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/>

===The 1970s===
[[Johnny Whiteley]] joined Hull Kingston Rovers as coach in 1970 and stayed until 1972.

In the early 1970s Hull KR purchased a site at Winchester Avenue with the aim of building a new stadium.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/> The plans never came to fruition and the site was later sold to a private developer.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/> The profit made from this land was used to buy back Craven Park with greyhound racing continuing as a subsidiary concern.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/>

New Zealand visited Craven Park on 8 September 1971. The Kiwis, playing their third game in five days, were unable to match the Robins, who beat the Kiwis 12–10.

Coach [[Harry Poole (rugby league)|Harry Poole]] died in 1976/77, and Millward took over as temporary player-coach and in his first season guided the club to their first ever [[BBC2 Floodlit Trophy]] victory as the Robins beat [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]] 26–11. The club finished 4th out of 16 in the league.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/>

[[Phil Hogan (rugby league)|Phil Hogan]] was transferred to Hull KR in 1978 for a then world record fee of £35,000.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/> Rovers topped the [[Rugby Football League Championship|league]] for the first time since 1925.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/> In 1979/80, under coach [[Roger Millward]], Hull KR achieved a famous defeat of neighbours Hull F.C., by a margin of 10–5 in the final of the [[Challenge Cup]], at Wembley in front of 95,000 fans.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/> A makeshift sign was left on the A63 (the major westerly road out of Hull) that read "last one out turn the lights off!" due to most of the city travelling to Wembley for the final.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Also, a '10–5' bar is now situated inside Craven Park.

Steve Hubbard scored nine out of the ten points for Rovers. Millward played the full game, despite having his jaw broken early in the game.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/> Earlier in the same season, Rovers had lost in the final of the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy against Hull.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/>

===The 1980s and early 1990s===

In 1982/83 Rovers finished as runners-up in the league.<ref name="Ulyatt1983a"/> In 1983/84 Rovers were crowned champions of the 1st Division and went on to win the Divisional Premiership beating Castleford 18–10 in the final at Headingley; becoming the first team to win the Championship / Premiership double. In 1984–85 they nearly repeated the feat winning the Division 1 Championship but narrowly missing out in the final of the Premiership. Rovers also won the [[John Player Trophy]] beating Hull 12–0 in the final at [[Boothferry Park]] but lost 12–29 to Hull in the final of the Yorkshire Cup.

On 25 August 1985, professional rugby league was played for the first time on the [[Isle of Man]]. The Charity Shield between Hull Kingston Rovers and Challenge Cup winners Wigan drew a crowd of 4,066 to the Douglas Bowl. The final score was 34–6 to Wigan.

In 1985/86, Millward took Rovers to their sixth win in the Yorkshire Cup before they were defeated in the John Player Final and the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley narrowly losing 15–14 to Castleford. This proved to be Rovers last major final to date, as the team that had part dominated the English game faded away.

By the late 1980s, time had taken its toll on Craven Park stadium, following the [[Bradford City stadium fire]], capacity was restricted and the cost of safety work spiraled. Major renovations were needed to bring it up to scratch. Large amounts of money were spent on the ground each year repairing sections but once one section was repaired another would fall into disrepair. In 1988/89, their last full season at Craven Park, Rovers were relegated to the 2nd Division and Millward decided to stand down as coach. Wright Properties Ltd purchased Craven Park from the club and the final game was played there on 9 April 1989.

A new stadium, [[Craven Park, Hull|New Craven Park]], was built on a site off Preston Road. New Craven Park was officially opened on Sunday 24 September 1989 as Rovers beat Trafford Borough 48–8 in front of 8,500 spectators. Rovers started the new era convincingly, and were crowned Second Division champions with promotion back to the top flight.

[[George Fairbairn (rugby league)|George Fairbairn]] was brought in as a player-coach in 1992 for a record fee of £72,500. In 1994/5, Rovers were relegated to the third division despite finishing mid table.

===1996-2006: Summer era===
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural [[Super League]] season and changed from a winter to a summer season.<ref name="hadfield20-12-95">{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rugbys-pounds-87m-deal-gives-murdoch-transfer-veto-1526582.html |publisher= The Independent |title=Rugby's pounds 87m deal gives Murdoch transfer veto |author=Dave Hadfield |date=20 December 1995 |accessdate=6 May 2009 |location=London}}</ref> When the Super League competition had been proposed, it was suggested Hull Kingston Rovers should merge with [[Hull F.C.]] to form 'Humberside' and compete in the Super League. This was resisted but despite finishing top of the [[Rugby Football League Championship Third Division|Third Division]], they were not promoted. As the sport in Britain entered a new era, it would be ten years before Rovers rose again to the top level of the game.

Rovers were again crowned champions of the now renamed [[Rugby Football League Championship Second Division|Second Division]] in 1996 and were this time promoted to the First Division. Rovers made some impact in 1997 and finished 8th. Rovers also won the only Challenge Cup Plate beating [[Hunslet Hawks]] 60–14 at Wembley.

Rovers finished second in the league in 1998, and came close to a Grand Final spot with a Super League spot at stake. The Robins were expected to go one better in 1999 and topped the table for most of the season before their run ended and the final six games saw them drop from first place to sixth, missing out on a play-off place. Disappointment followed the year after when the Robins finished in seventh place in the league after a mid-season collapse and exited the play-offs in the first round.

Don Robinson took control in 2001 and [[Gary Wilkinson (rugby league)|Gary Wilkinson]] became head coach. Despite reaching the [[National Cup]] final and finishing fourth in the league, Wilkinson made way for the club's first overseas coach, [[Steve Linnane]].

Under Linnane, the Robins came within eighty minutes of their first Grand Final appearance in 2002, after a largely successful end to the season, while the arrival of former player Nick Halafihi as chief executive, boosted the club's off-field activities.

In 2004 the club appointed [[Mal Reilly]] as Director of Rugby and [[Martin Hall (rugby league)|Martin Hall]] as first team coach after Steve Linnane's resignation. But Reilly left the club mid way through the season, while Hall took the club to the play-off semi-final before leaving once the season had finished. Halafihi also left the club.

[[Harvey Howard]] was appointed first team coach and Paul Lakin appointed chief executive in late 2004. Howard was dismissed shortly before the [[2005 Northern Rail Cup|Northern Rail Cup]] Final, which Rovers went on to win 18–16 over [[Castleford Tigers]], with the Robins utilising the temporary player-coaching abilities of [[James Webster (rugby league)|James Webster]].

Permanently taking over from Howard was the former Toulouse coach, [[Justin Morgan (rugby league)|Justin Morgan]]. October 2005 who saw the club still in the National League, after failing to get past the semi final stage of the NL1 play-offs. Rovers also started a number of ground improvements, including the laying of a new pitch, and widening of the playing surface. They also made some significant signings for the 2006 season.

Up to that time unbeaten in their 2006 fixtures, in early June they were drawn to meet [[Super League]] side [[Warrington Wolves]], in the quarter final of the Challenge Cup. It was arguably their biggest fixture for some years. Against all the odds the Robins won, 40–36, their best result in the competition since their 1980 Challenge Cup win against local rivals Hull F.C. This result also created a new club record of 18 consecutive wins. The victory set up a [[semi final]] tie against Super League leaders, [[St Helens RLFC|St Helens]].

Rovers also progressed to the final of the Northern Rail Cup for the second successive season, against [[Leigh Centurions]] at Bloomfield Road, [[Blackpool]] on 16 July. Leigh Centurions won this game 22–18, thus ending Rovers' twenty four match unbeaten run. The club's Challenge Cup campaign also came to an abrupt halt, Rovers gamely succumbing 50–0 to triple-winning St Helens at The [[Galpharm Stadium]], [[Huddersfield]].

September 2006 saw Rovers crowned [[National League One]] Minor Premier winners, and qualify for an automatic place in the NL1 play-off semi final at Craven Park against [[Widnes Vikings]] whom they beat 29–22 to reach the first Grand Final in their history, which they won 29–16, earning a place in the following season's Super League competition.

===2007-2014: Super League===
After close-season signings and an overseas training camp, Rovers made a better than expected start to their first Super League campaign, winning their first two games – [[Wakefield Trinity Wildcats]] at home and [[Huddersfield Giants]] away. After suffering a reversal to [[Harlequins Rugby League|Harlequins RL]], they then had an away win (26–16) at Wigan, followed by a hard-fought victory at home to in-form Leeds, to go joint top of the early season [[table (information)|table]]. However, inconsistent form, injuries and the effects of the first Super League sending-off (after 96 games) saw Rovers slip to near the bottom, despite a historic double away win over Wigan, and beating local rivals Hull F.C. at the [[Magic Weekend|Millennium Magic]] weekend. Improved late season results, including the safety-clinching win in the derby against Hull F.C. by the shock margin of 6–42 (played at the KC Stadium), ensured Super League status for another campaign.

Hull KR made significant changes to their squad for the 2008 season, which saw eleven new players brought in and a number of players released or sold. On 2 May the club announced that former captain James Webster had been released from the final six months of his contract due to a three to four-month lay off with a shoulder injury. He was replaced by new signing [[Michael Dobson (rugby league)|Michael Dobson]], who was formerly a target of Hull F.C. The Canberra Raiders scrum half took squad number 26, and made his début against Harlequins RL on 25 May, scoring two tries. Rovers finished one point away from a play-off place.

2009 saw further consolidation of Hull KR's Super League status with away victories at St Helens, Wigan and Warrington in a seven match winning run, taking Rovers briefly to the top position in the table. A less successful spell followed, due to inconsistency, injuries and international calls, but by mid August 2009 Rovers were fourth in the table, five points clear of the next placed side.

2011 saw the end of Justin Morgan's reign as head coach and the club appointed [[Craig Sandercock]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Sandercock Appointed|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/15048600|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=20 January 2014}}</ref> as the new head coach for the 2012 season. Finishing 10th<ref>{{cite web|title=Rugby League Project|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/super-league-xvii-2012/summary.html|accessdate=20 January 2014}}</ref> in his first season as a head coach and then making the play-offs in 2013, finishing 8th.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rugby League Project.org|url=http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/seasons/super-league-xviii-2013/summary.html|accessdate=20 January 2014}}</ref>

Despite making several big name signings for the 2014 season, Rovers failed to make any kind of impact in the league & with 8 games remaining they parted company with Sandercock, appointing assistant coach & ex player Chris Chester as the new First Team Coach of Hull KR.  Chester couldn't steer the club to a playoff spot in his first 8 games in charge and they finished the season in 9th position.

===2015-present: Progress and Challenge Cup final===
Chester take charge of his first full season as Hull Kingston Rovers Head Coach in 2015 and despite a mass clearout of the 2014 squad, he has made several high profile signings, notably, Ken Sio, Albert Kelly, Maurice Blair, Terry Campese, Mitch Allgood, Ryan Bailey & Darrell Goulding.

The club's first major final in 29 years ended in a record defeat along with the highest losing margin in a Challenge Cup final against Leeds Rhinos by 50 points to nil.

Chester was sacked on 24 February 2016 just three matches into the 2016 season (two losses and a draw).  James Webster took the reins, and led the Robins to four defeats in the following five games.

==Stadium==

===1895-1922: Craven Street===
Hull KR first purchased land on Craven Street in 1895 and played their first games there until 1922 when they built and developed a bigger stadium at Old Craven Park with better facilities.

===1922-1989: Old Craven Park===
{{Main|Old Craven Park}}
Hull KR moved to Craven Park from their cramped Craven Street ground in 1922. The club purchased and developed a site behind the tram and bus depot on the eastern end of Holderness Road and it hosted its first game on 2 September 1922. Craven Park also hosted [[greyhound racing]]. Hull Kingston Rovers sold the ground to the Greyhound Racing Company in 1930s due to financial difficulties, securing a long term lease to continue playing there.

In the early 1970s Hull Kingston Rovers purchased a site at Winchester Avenue with the aim of building a new stadium there. These plans never came to fruition and the site was later sold to a private developer. The profit made from this land was used to buy back Craven Park with greyhound racing continuing as a subsidiary concern. Following the [[Bradford City stadium fire]], capacity was restricted and costs of safety work spiraled. With the club in debt the ground was sold to developers and the final game was played there on 9 April 1989.
