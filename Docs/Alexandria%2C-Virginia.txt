'''Alexandria''', also called '''The City of Alexandria''', is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] in the [[Commonwealth#U.S. states|Commonwealth]] of [[Virginia]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population was 139,966,<ref name="QF">{{cite web|title=State & County QuickFacts|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/51/51510.html|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref> and in 2014, the population was estimated to be 150,575.<ref name="USCensusEst2014"/> Located along the western bank of the [[Potomac River]], Alexandria is approximately {{convert|7|mi|0}} south of [[Downtown, Washington, D.C.|downtown Washington, D.C.]]

Like the rest of [[Northern Virginia]], as well as [[Central Maryland]], modern Alexandria has been shaped by its proximity to the U.S. capital. It is largely populated by professionals working in the federal civil service, in the U.S. military, or for one of the many private companies which contract to provide services to the federal government. One of Alexandria's largest employers is the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]. Another is the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]]. In 2005, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] moved to Alexandria.

The historic center of Alexandria is known as '''Old Town'''. With its concentration of boutiques, restaurants, [[antique shop]]s and theaters, it is a major draw for tourists. Like Old Town, many Alexandria neighborhoods are compact, walkable, high-income suburbs of Washington, D.C. It is the 7th largest and highest-income independent city in Virginia.

A portion of adjacent [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] is named "Alexandria," but it is under the jurisdiction of Fairfax County and separate from the city; the city is sometimes referred to as the City of Alexandria or Alexandria City to avoid confusion. In 1920, Virginia's General Assembly voted to incorporate what had been Alexandria County as [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] to minimize confusion.

==History==
{{Main|History of Alexandria, Virginia|Timeline of Alexandria, Virginia}}

===Colonial era===
[[File:1878 Alexandria County Virginia.jpg|thumb|alt=Map labeled "Alexandria County" on old yellowed paper, with Potomac River along upper right|Map of Alexandria County (1878), including what is now [[Arlington County]] and the City of Alexandria. Map includes the names of property owners at that time. City boundaries roughly correspond with Old Town.]]
The first European settlement was established in 1695 in what was then the [[English colonial empire|English]] [[Colony of Virginia]]. Virginia's comprehensive [[Tobacco Inspection Act of 1730|Tobacco Inspection Law of 1730]] mandated that all tobacco grown in the colony must be brought to locally designated public warehouses for inspection before sale: one of the sites designated for a warehouse on the upper [[Potomac River]] was at the mouth of [[Hunting Creek]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.tobacco.org/History/colonialtobacco.html |title=Economic Aspects of Tobacco during the Colonial Period 1612–1776 |publisher=Tobacco.org |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>  However, the ground being unsuitable at that location, the warehouse was established a half-mile up river, where the water ran deep near the shore.

Following the 1745 settlement of the colony's 10-year-long dispute with Lord Fairfax over the western boundary of the [[Northern Neck Proprietary]]—the Privy Council in London finding in favor of Lord Fairfax's expanded claim—some of the gentry class of Fairfax County banded together to form the [[Ohio Company]] of Virginia. Their intent was to establish trade into the interior of America and for this they required an ''entrepot'' close to the head of navigation on the Potomac. The Hunting Creek tobacco warehouse offered the best location for a trading port which could accommodate sailing ships. However, many of the local tobacco planters wanted a new town to be sited up Hunting Creek, away from the "played out" tobacco fields along the river.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28266 |title=Discovering the Decades: 1740s &#124; Historic Alexandria &#124; City of Alexandria, VA |publisher=Alexandriava.gov |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>

Around 1746, Captain [[Philip Alexander II]] (1704–1753) moved to what is south of present Duke Street in Alexandria. His estate, which consisted of {{convert|500|acre|km2}}, was bounded by Hunting Creek, Hooff's Run, the Potomac River, and approximately the line which would become Cameron Street. At the opening of Virginia's 1748–49 legislative session, there was a petition submitted in the [[House of Burgesses]] on November 1, 1748, that the "inhabitants of Fairfax (Co.) praying that a town may be established at Hunting Creek Warehouse on Potowmack River," as [[Hugh West]] was the owner of the warehouse. The petition was introduced by [[Lawrence Washington (1718-1752)]], the representative for Fairfax County and, more importantly, the son-in-law of [[William Fairfax]] and a founding member of the Ohio Company. To support the Company's push for a town on the river, Lawrence's younger brother [[George Washington]], an aspiring surveyor, made a sketch of the shoreline touting the advantages of the tobacco warehouse site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/gwmaps.html|title=George Washington: Surveyor and Mapmaker|work=loc.gov}}</ref>

Since the river site was amidst his estate, Philip opposed the idea and strongly favored a site at the head of Hunting Creek (also known as Great Hunting Creek). It has been said that in order to avoid a predicament the petitioners offered to name the new town ''Alexandria'', in honor of Philip's family. As a result, Philip and his cousin Captain [[John Alexander (captain)|John Alexander]] (1711–1763) gave land to assist in the development of Alexandria, and are thus listed as the founders. This John was the son of [[Robert Alexander II]] (1688–1735). On May 2, 1749, the House of Burgesses approved the river location and ordered "Mr. Washington do go up with a Message to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council]] and acquaint them that this House have agreed to the Amendments titled An Act for erecting a Town at Hunting Creek Warehouse, in the County of Fairfax."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_ktAAAAYAAJ&dq=House+of+Burgesses+Virginia+1748&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=5AI_CzxOGB&sig=wFKQnbb1AliPSD5TqKbNRWa2nxY&hl=en&ei=HMJvSq_UJY3-MdbU5ekI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Journals of the House of Burgesses of Virginia, 1742–1747, 1748–1749 – Virginia.

The auction was conducted on July 13–14, 1749.

Almost immediately upon establishment, the town founders called the new town "Belhaven", believed to be in honor of a Scottish patriot, [[John Hamilton, 2nd Lord Belhaven and Stenton]], the Northern Neck tobacco trade being then dominated by Scots. The name Belhaven was used in official lotteries to raise money for a Church and Market House, but it was never approved by the legislature and fell out of favor in the mid-1750s.<ref>[http://files.usgwarchives.net/va/richmondcity/newspapers/gazette5.txt The Scheme of a Lottery, at Belhaven, in Fairfax County: January 24, 1750/51; Virginia Gazette extracts; The William and Mary Quarterly, Vol.12 No.2 (October 1903)]</ref> The town of Alexandria did not become incorporated until 1779.

In 1755, General [[Edward Braddock]] organized his fatal expedition against [[Fort Duquesne]] at [[Carlyle House]] in Alexandria. In April 1755, the governors of Virginia, and the Provinces of [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]], [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]], and [[Province of New York|New York]] met to determine upon concerted action against the [[Early Modern France|French]] in America.

In March 1785, commissioners from Virginia and Maryland met in Alexandria to discuss the commercial relations of the two states, finishing their business at [[Mount Vernon]]. The [[Mount Vernon Conference]] concluded on March 28 with an agreement for freedom of trade and freedom of navigation of the Potomac River. The Maryland legislature, in ratifying this agreement on November 22, proposed a conference among representatives from all the states to consider the adoption of definite commercial regulations. This led to the calling of the [[Annapolis Convention of 1786]], which in turn led to the calling of the [[Federal Convention of 1787]].

In 1791, Alexandria was included in the area chosen by [[George Washington]] to become the District of Columbia.

In 1814, during the [[War of 1812]], a British fleet launched a successful [[Raid on Alexandria]], which surrendered without a fight. As agreed in the terms of surrender the British looted stores and warehouses of mainly flour, [[tobacco]], [[cotton]], [[wine]], and [[sugar]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://alexandriava.gov/historic/info/default.aspx?id=28306 | title=Discovering the Decades: 1810s | publisher=Alexandria Archaeology Museum}}</ref>

A portion of the City of Alexandria—known as "Old Town"—and all of today's [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] share the distinction of having been originally in Virginia, ceded to the U.S. Government to form the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and later [[Retrocession (District of Columbia)|retroceded to Virginia]] by the federal government in 1846, when the District was reduced in size to exclude the portion south of the Potomac River. Over time, a movement grew to separate Alexandria from the District of Columbia (the [[District of Columbia retrocession]]). As competition grew with the port of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] and the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] fostered development on the north side of the Potomac River, the city's economy stagnated, together with the loss of representation and rights to vote and failed expectations for economic benefit from the new district. Alexandria was also an important port and market in the [[slave trade]], and there were increasing talk of the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of slavery in the national capital. Alexandria's economy would suffer greatly if slavery were outlawed. After a referendum, voters petitioned Congress and Virginia to return the area to Virginia. Congress retroceded the area to Virginia on July 9, 1846.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.citymuseumdc.org/gettoknow/faq.asp | title=Get to know D.C. – Frequently Asked Questions About Washington, D.C. | publisher=History Society of Washington, D.C.}}</ref> The City of Alexandria was re-chartered in 1852 and became independent of [[Alexandria County, D.C.|Alexandria County]] in 1870. The remaining portion of Alexandria County changed its name to [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] in 1920.

The first fatalities of the North and South in the [[American Civil War]] occurred in Alexandria. Within a month of the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]], where two died, Union troops occupied Alexandria, landing troops at the base of King Street on the Potomac River on May 24, 1861. A few blocks up King Street from their landing site, the commander of the [[11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment|New York Fire Zouaves]], Colonel [[Elmer E. Ellsworth]], sortied with a small detachment to retrieve a large [[Confederate flag]] displayed on the roof of the [[Marshall House (Alexandria, Virginia)|Marshall House Inn]] that had been visible from the White House. While descending from the roof, Ellsworth was killed by Captain James W. Jackson, the hotel proprietor. One of the soldiers in Ellsworth's party shot Jackson immediately thereafter.<ref name="sonofthesouth.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.sonofthesouth.net/leefoundation/civil-war/colonel-ellsworth-marshall-house.htm |title=Death of Colonel Ellsworth, Harper's Weekly (June 15, 1861) |publisher=Sonofthesouth.net |date=January 26, 2007 |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref> After Ellsworth's death, he was publicized as a Union martyr. The incident generated great excitement in the North.<ref name="sonofthesouth.net" /> Jackson's death caused a lesser, but similar sensation in the South.

Alexandria remained under military occupation until the end of the Civil War. One of the ring of forts built during the war by the Union army for the defense of [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Fort Ward (Virginia)|Fort Ward]], is located within the boundaries of modern Alexandria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alexandriava.gov/FortWard|title= Fort Ward Museum|publisher=|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}</ref>  After the establishment of the state of [[West Virginia]] in 1863 and until the close of the war, Alexandria was the seat of the [[Restored Government of Virginia]] also known as the "Alexandria Government." During the Union occupation, a recurring point of contention between the Alexandria citizenry and the military occupiers was the military's periodic insistence that church services include prayers for the President of the United States, resulting in incidents such as the full arrest of a minister in his church.
 
Escaped [[African American]] slaves poured into the military occupation of Alexandria. Safely behind Union lines, the cities of Alexandria and Washington offered not only comparative freedom, but employment. Over the course of the war, Alexandria was transformed by the Union occupiers into a major supply depot and transport and hospital center, all under army control.<ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria">{{cite web|url=http://alexandriava.gov/uploadedFiles/historic/info/archaeology/ARFreedmensHistoricalOverview.pdf |title=Office of Historic Alexandria, Alexandria Freedmen's Cemetery: Historical Overview, April 2007, p. 2. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref> Because the escaped slaves were still legally property until the abolition of slavery, they were labeled as [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] to prevent their being returned to their masters. Contrabands took positions with the army in various support roles. According to one statistic, the population of Alexandria had exploded to 18,000 by the fall of 1863 – an increase of 10,000 people in 16 months.<ref name="Office of Historic Alexandria" />

As of ratification of [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|the Fifteenth Amendment]], Alexandria County's black population was more than 8,700, or about half the total number of residents in the County. This newly enfranchised constituency provided the support necessary to elect the first black Alexandrians to the City Council and the Virginia Legislature.<ref name="alexandriaweba.com">[http://www.alexandriaweba.com/go/alexandriaafricanamericanhistory/freedmancemetery ]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}</ref>

In 1930, Alexandria annexed the town of [[Potomac, Virginia|Potomac]]. That town, adjacent to [[Potomac Yard]], had been laid out beginning in the late 19th century and incorporated in 1908.<!--did anything happen after that?-->

By the late 20th century, Alexandria had become a key portion of the urban agglomeration of Northern Virginia.

==Geography==
[[File:AlexandriaVAWaterfront.jpg|thumb|alt=Modern photo of piers extending into quiet water with a dozen boats docked to them.|Alexandria waterfront, along the Potomac River]]
[[File:USA-Alexandria Marina0.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Modern color photo of a boat on a sunny day docked to a wharf with a large building behind it|Marina behind the Torpedo Factory]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|40.1|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|38.9|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|1.1|sqkm|order=flip}}, or 2.85%, is water.<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Alexandria is bounded on the east by the [[Potomac River]], on the north and northwest by [[Arlington County]], and on the south by [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]]. The western portions of the city were annexed from those two entities beginning in the 1930s.

The [[address (geography)|addressing system]] in Alexandria is not uniform and reflects the consolidation of several originally separate communities into a single city. In Old Town Alexandria, building numbers are assigned north and south from [[King Street (Alexandria, Virginia)|King Street]] and west (only) from the Potomac River. In the areas formerly in the town of [[Potomac, Virginia|Potomac]], such as Del Ray and St. Elmo, building numbers are assigned east and west from Commonwealth Avenue and north (only) from King Street. In the western parts of the city, building numbers are assigned north and south from [[Virginia State Route 236|Duke Street]].

The [[ZIP code]] prefix 223 uniquely identifies the Alexandria postal area.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} However, the Alexandria postal area extends into [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]] and includes addresses outside of the city. Delivery areas have ZIP codes 22301, 22302, 22203, 22304, 22305, 22306, 22307, 22308, 22309, 22310, 22311, 22312, 22314, and 22315,  with other ZIP codes in use for [[post office box]]es and large mailers (22313, 22331, 22332, 22333).

Adjacent jurisdictions include:
* [[Arlington County, Virginia]] – north
* [[Fairfax County, Virginia]] – west and south
* [[District of Columbia]] – northeast
* [[Prince George's County, Maryland]] – east

There is one national protected area in Alexandria:
* [[George Washington Memorial Parkway]] (part)

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Alexandria has a [[humid subtropical climate]], abbreviated "Cfa" on climate maps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=609844&cityname=Alexandria%2C+Virginia%2C+United+States+of+America&units=|title=Climate Summary for Alexandria, Virginia|work=Weatherbase|accessdate=September 19, 2014}}</ref>

===Eco-City===
In 2008, the Alexandria City Council approved an "Eco-City" charter with the goal of guiding the city and its residents toward "sustainability". The term "Eco-City" was first coined by Richard Register in his 1987 book ''Ecocity Berkeley: building cities for a healthy future''. An "Eco-City" is typically defined as one in which inhabitants are dedicated to the minimal consumption of energy, water and food as well as minimal production of air and water pollution. Alexandria, however, defined sustainability instead as meeting the city's present needs while preserving its historic character and ensuring the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

==Neighborhoods==
{{Main|List of neighborhoods in Alexandria, Virginia}}
Neighborhoods in Alexandria include Old Town, Eisenhower Valley, Rosemont, The Berg, Parker-Gray, Del Ray, Arlandria, West End, and North Ridge.

Many neighborhoods and cities outside of the city limits, including [[Hollin Hills]], [[Franconia, Virginia|Franconia]], [[Groveton, Virginia|Groveton]], [[Hybla Valley, Virginia|Hybla Valley]], [[Huntington, Virginia|Huntington]], [[Belle Haven, Fairfax County, Virginia|Belle Haven]], [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon]], [[Fort Hunt, Virginia|Fort Hunt]], Engleside, Burgundy Village, Waynewood, Wilton Woods, [[Rose Hill, Fairfax County, Virginia|Rose Hill]], Virginia Hills, Hayfield, and [[Kingstowne, Virginia|Kingstowne]] use an Alexandria address. These areas are actually part of [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], not the City of Alexandria. Many locals refer to the non-City-of-Alexandria area that has an Alexandria zip code as "Lower Alexandria" or "South Alexandria"; it may also sometimes be called "Alexandria, Fairfax County."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nesbittrealty.com/guide/fairfax-county/southern-fairfax-county/alexandria/ | title=About homes and condos of Alexandria VA in Fairfax County | publisher=Nesbitt Realty}}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:Alexandria (VA) City Hall.jpg|thumb|Alexandria City Hall]]
As an independent city of Virginia (as opposed to an incorporated town within a county), Alexandria derives its governing authority from the [[Virginia General Assembly]]. In order to revise the power and structure of the city government, the city must request the General Assembly to amend the charter. The present charter was granted in 1950 and it has been amended in 1968, 1971, 1976, and 1982.

Alexandria adopted a council-manager form of government by way of referendum in 1921. This type of government empowers the elected City Council to pass legislation and appoint the City Manager. The City Manager is responsible for overseeing the city's administration.

The Mayor, who is chosen on a separate ballot, presides over meetings of the Council and serves as the ceremonial head of government. The Mayor does not have the power to veto Council action. Council members traditionally choose the person receiving the most votes in the election to serve as Vice Mayor. In the absence or disability of the Mayor, the Vice Mayor performs the mayoral duties.

[[File:NVCC - Alexandria campus.jpg|thumb|alt=Big street with cars waiting at intersection|Entrance to Northern Virginia Community College's Alexandria campus]]
The city is served by the [[Alexandria City Public Schools]] system and by the Alexandria campus of [[Northern Virginia Community College]]. The largest seminary in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]], [[Virginia Theological Seminary]], is located on Seminary Road. [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech's]] Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center, also known as WAAC, is located on Prince Street in Old Town, offering graduate programs in Urban Affairs and Planning, Public and International Affairs, Architecture, and Landscape Architecture. [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] operates a Northern Virginia branch of its School of Social Work and [[The George Washington University]] (Washington DC) also has a campus near the King Street metro. This campus mainly offers professional and vocational programs, such as an executive MBA program, urban planning and security studies.

Alexandria has several of the Washington, D.C., area's top private schools, such as [[St. Stephen's and St. Agnes School]], [[Bishop Ireton High School]], and [[Episcopal High School (Alexandria, Virginia)|Episcopal High School]]. Also in the city are Alexandria Country Day School, Commonwealth Academy, St. Mary's Catholic School, St. Rita's Catholic School, Blessed Sacrament School and [[Global Health College]].

Alexandria's public school system consists of thirteen elementary schools for grades 5-year-old Kindergarten through Grade 5. Middle Schools, George Washington and Francis C. Hammond, serve 6th through 8th graders. Minnie Howard Ninth Grade Center and [[T.C. Williams High School]] serve grades 9th and 10 through 12, respectively, for the entire city.

The demographics of Alexandria City Public Schools contrast with those of the city. In 2008, only 14% of the students at Francis C. Hammond Middle School were non-Hispanic whites, compared to about 60% when looking at the city as a whole. 27% were of Hispanic descent, and 48% were black. About 9% of the school was of Asian descent. In 2004, 62% of the school received free lunches; by 2008, that number had decreased to 56%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100069&udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|work=bestplaces.net}}</ref> At George Washington Middle School, 30% of students are non-Hispanic whites, 24% were Hispanic, and 41% was black. 3% of the students were Asian, and 52% of students received free lunch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestplaces.net/school/SchoolStats.aspx?uid=5100071&udid=15100030|title=Best Places to Live in the United States|work=bestplaces.net}}</ref> T.C.

====History of libraries====
John Wise, a local Alexandria businessman and hotel keeper, hosted a meeting in his home in 1789 to discuss the creation of a Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge. Members include Rev. James Muir, physician [[Elisha Cullen Dick]], and George Washington's personal attorney [[Charles Lee (Attorney General)|Charles Lee]]. The Society did not last for long. However, on July 24, 1794, the founders of the Society once again met at Wise's home to establish a subscription library. During the first year, one hundred nineteen men joined the circulating library which was to be called the Library Company of Alexandria. Members agreed to pay an initiation fee and annual dues. The company was chartered as a corporation in 1798 in an act passed by the [[General Assembly of Virginia]].

Druggist Edward Stabler was elected the first librarian and the library's first location is believed to have been housed in his [[Stabler-Leadbeater Apothecary Shop|apothecary shop]]. James Kennedy was elected the second librarian, and the library moved to his residence and place of business. Kennedy sold books from his personal collection to the Library Company. Those books and other bought from two local merchants formed the foundation of the subscription library. The first catalog of the library's collection was published in 1797. The collection grew over time, bolstered in part by the fact that some members paid their dues in books. Most members were initially men, although records exist showing some women were members as early as 1798. One noted female member in 1817 was [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Mary L.F. Custis]], wife of [[George Washington Parke Custis]].

The catalog published in 1801 indicated a collection of 452 books, mostly on history and travel. By 1815, there were 1,022 entries in the catalog, and the collection had added more biographies, fiction, and magazines. The library was housed in several locations over the ensuing years, including the New Market House next to the City Hall, the [[Lyceum]] Company building, and Peabody Hall, which was owned by the Alexandria School Board. Raising funds for the library was a continuing challenge. In 1853, a lecture series was created to raise money. Speakers included Professor [[Joseph Henry]] of the Smithsonian, Colonel [[Francis H. Smith]] of the Virginia Military Institute, and humorist [[George W. Bagby]].

The arrival of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861 took its toll on the library collection. Members were able to remove some of the collection prior to the library's occupation by Union troops. The library was used as a hospital and much of the library's collection was lost during this time. After the war, the building was sold to a private owner who planned to turn the building into a private residence and asked the library to remove what was left of the collection. Funds continued to be hard to come by and in 1879, the Library Company closed. The remainder of its collection was stored in Peabody Hall.

In 1897, a group of women in Alexandria formed the Alexandria Library Association. The leaders of the group were Virginia Corse, Mrs. William B. Smoot, and Virginia Burke. They petitioned the school board to open a subscription library in Peabody Hall, using the old books stored there. Permission was given and doors to the new subscription library opened on December 1, 1897. In 1902, the library moved to the first floor of a house in the 1300 block of Prince Street while negotiations were underway for a permanent move to the Confederate Hall, located at 806 Prince Street. In May 1903, the library moved to the Confederate Hall, now known as the Robert E. Lee Camp Hall Museum, where it stayed for 34 years.

In 1936, Dr. and Mrs. Robert South Barrett presented a proposal to the Library Association. They agreed to donate a building in memory of Dr. Barrett's mother, [[Kate Waller Barrett]], if the city would commit to running it as a public library. The city agreed and the Society of Friends offered a 99-year lease on an old Quaker graveyard located on Queen Street. The old library was closed on March 1 for the books to be packed and moved to the new library, which opened to the public in August 1937. The Alexandria Library Association became the Alexandria Library Society.

In 1947, the Library Society was reconstituted and took the earlier historic name Alexandria Library Company. A lecture series was also revived. Speakers included [[Thomas Jefferson]] biographer [[Dumas Malone]]. Some of the books belonging in the original collection of the Alexandria Library Company can now be found in the Local History/Special Collections Room at the Queen Street library that still carries Mrs. Barrett's name.<ref>Seale, William. ''The Alexandria Library Company''. Alexandria, Virginia: Alexandria Library, 2007.</ref>

In 1948 [[Ellen Coolidge Burke]] became director. Burke brought [[bookmobile]] services to Alexandria, one of the first services in Virginia.  She oversaw the growth of the library system by the addition of two new branch libraries.  In April 1968 the Ellen Coolidge Burke Branch at 4701 Seminary Road was opened, and in December 1969 the [[James M. Duncan]] branch at 2501 Commonwealth Avenue.  Burke retired in 1969.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexandria.lib.va.us/client/en_US/home/;jsessionid=55F1FE7BBEDA3613D2634F145C817736.enterprise-23800?rm=ELLEN+COOLIDGE1{{!}}{{!}}{{!}}1{{!}}{{!}}{{!}}0{{!}}{{!}}{{!}}true&ic=true&dt=list|title=Ellen Coolidge Burke|publisher=Alexandria Libraries}}</ref>

These parades and other official events are typically lead by Alexandria's town crier, who, often dressed in elaborately, by a tradition dating to the 18th century, in a red coat, breeches, black boots and a tricorne hat, welcomes participants.[https://books.google.com/books?id=NMile_QCKlcC&pg=PT18&lpg=PT18&dq=peter+logan+and+ben+fiore-walker&source=bl&ots=J4DJtnP1Xy&sig=17f7dO2EmmgPBPopd7NVpM8CZxw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjh7JOt9YvLAhXFKh4KHWSHD04Q6AEIIzAC#v=onepage&q=peter%20logan%20and%20ben%20f]

===Parks and recreation===
Alexandria has a distributed park system with approximately {{convert|950|acre|km2}} spread across 70 major parks and 30 [[recreation]] centers, of which [[Castanea pumila|Chinquapin]] is one of the largest. Chinquapin offers facilities for swimming, tennis, racquetball, and other sports. The city also organizes several sports leagues throughout the year including volleyball, softball and basketball.

The city is home to [[Cameron Run Regional Park]] which includes a water park with a [[wave pool]] and [[water slide]]s, as well as a [[miniature golf]] course and batting cages. A portion of the [[Mount Vernon Trail]], a popular bike and jogging path, runs through Old Town near the Potomac River on its way from the Mount Vernon Estate to Roosevelt Island in Washington, DC. There is also a largely unbroken line of parks stretching along the Alexandria waterfront from end to end.

==Sports==
Due to its proximity to Washington, Alexandria has only been the home of one professional sports team, the [[Alexandria Dukes]], a minor league baseball team which has moved to [[Woodbridge, Virginia|Woodbridge]] and is now named the [[Potomac Nationals]]. However, the [[Cal Ripken, Sr. Collegiate Baseball League]] brought baseball back to Alexandria in 2008 in the form of the [[Alexandria (VA) Aces|Alexandria Aces]]. In addition, TC Williams, Bishop Ireton, St. Stephen's and Episcopal have storied histories in athletics, such as football, basketball, baseball and lacrosse. The largest youth sport in Alexandria is soccer with almost 2,500 players ages 2–18 who participate in the Alexandria Soccer Association.

==Transportation==
[[File:Amtrak 82 at Alexandria Union Station in 2007.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Big shiny train facing us, at station with passengers on platform|Southbound [[Amtrak]] train at Alexandria's Union Station]]
Alexandria is bisected east and west by [[State Route 7 (Virginia)|State Route 7]], known inside the city limits as the major thoroughfare of [[King Street, Alexandria, Virginia|King Street]]. The most western section of King St here once was the terminus of the Leesburg Turnpike. Interstate 95/495 (the [[Interstate 495 (Capital Beltway)|Capital Beltway]]), including the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] over the Potomac River, approximately parallels the city's southern boundary with Fairfax County. [[Interstate 395 (District of Columbia-Virginia)|Interstate 395]] crosses north and south through the western part of the city. Other major routes include north–south [[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|U.S. 1]] (Patrick and Henry Streets after [[Patrick Henry]], Jefferson Davis Hwy and Richmond Highway), Washington St/[[George Washington Memorial Parkway]], Russell Rd, Quaker Lane, Van Dorn St and Beauregard St, and east–west Duke Street ([[State Route 236 (Virginia)|State Route 236]]), Braddock Rd and Janney's Lane/Seminary Rd.

Alexandria is located just south of [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] in Arlington County. As with other Washington suburbs, Alexandria is also served by [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in [[Sterling, Virginia]] and by [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] near [[Baltimore, Maryland]].

[[Union Station (Alexandria)|Alexandria Union Station]], the city's historic train station, is served by both [[Amtrak]] intercity and [[Virginia Railway Express]] regional rail service. The station is directly adjacent to the [[King Street – Old Town (WMATA station)|King Street – Old Town]] [[Washington Metro]] station, at the convergence of the [[Blue Line (Washington Metro)|Blue]] and [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Lines]]. Three other Metro stations that lie within the city limits are [[Braddock Road (Washington Metro)|Braddock Road]], [[Van Dorn Street (Washington Metro)|Van Dorn Street]], and [[Eisenhower Avenue (Washington Metro)|Eisenhower Avenue]].

The traditional boundary between Old Town and the latterly annexed sections of the city followed the railway now owned by [[CSX Transportation]].

The city government operates its own mass transit system, the [[Driving Alexandrians Safely Home|DASH]] bus, connecting points of interest with local transit hubs. [[Metrobus (Washington, D.C.)|Metrobus]], [[Washington Metro]], and the [[Virginia Railway Express]], better known as the VRE, also serve  Alexandria. The city also offers a free "trolley" diesel bus service on King Street from the King Street Metro Station to the Waterfront<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dashbus.com/Trolley|title=DASH : King Street Trolley – FREE|work=dashbus.com|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}</ref> and a water taxi to and from the [[National Harbor]] development in Prince George's County, Maryland.

==Sister cities==
Alexandria has four [[town twinning|sister cities]], as designated by [[Sister Cities International]]:
* {{flagicon|ARM}} [[Gyumri]], [[Armenia]]
* {{flagicon|SWE}} [[Helsingborg]], [[Sweden]]
* {{flagicon|Scotland}} [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Tobacco to Tourism: Celebrating Alexandria's Scottish Heritage – "Dundee, Scotland: Alexandria's Sister City"| url= http://oha.alexandriava.gov/oha-main/oha_tobacco_exhibit.html |publisher=City Council, City of Alexandria, Virginia| accessdate =March 18, 2008}}</ref>

Alexandria was twinned with Gyumri as a means of showing good will in the wake of the [[1988 Armenian earthquake]]. Some Armenian architects were invited to study in Virginia and an Alexandria-Gyumri Armenian festival is held around [[Alexandria City Hall|City Hall]] every year in June, the date of which is declared Armenia Day in Alexandria by the mayor.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}

Alexandria has been twinned with Caen in France since 1991. The sister city relationship sees delegations visiting between the two cities on a regular basis. Exchanges of students have been common. Musicians and choirs from the two cities have also made very successful visits. In most years, members of the Alexandria-Caen Sister City Committee travel to Caen for the ''Foire de Caen'', a large international trade fair held in mid-September. Along with Caen's other sister cities, the Alexandria delegation has the chance to introduce its city to the people of Normandy, while getting the chance to learn more about this historic region of France.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}

An office in the [[Alexandria City Hall]] handles sister city projects.{{citation needed|date = March 2016}}
