It is the [[official language|official]] and literary standard of Croatia and one of the official languages of the [[European Union]]. Croatian is also one of the official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a recognized minority language in Serbia, and neighbouring countries.

Standard Croatian is based on the most widespread dialect of Serbo-Croatian, [[Shtokavian dialect|Shtokavian]], more specifically on [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect|Eastern Herzegovinian]], which is also the basis of [[Serbian language|Standard Serbian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]. In the mid-18th century, the first attempts to provide a Croatian literary standard began on the basis of the Neo-Shtokavian dialect that served as a supraregional ''lingua franca'' pushing back regional Chakavian, Kajkavian, and Shtokavian vernaculars.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Bičanić|Frančić|Hudeček|Mihaljević|2013|p=55}}</ref> The decisive role was played by [[Croatian Vukovians]], who cemented the usage of Ijekavian Neo-Shtokavian as the literary standard in the late 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, as well as designed a phonological orthography.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Bičanić|Frančić|Hudeček|Mihaljević|2013|p=84}}</ref> Croatian is written in [[Gaj's Latin alphabet]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/slavic/croatia/dictionary/ |title=Croatia: Themes, Authors, Books &#124; Yale University Library Slavic and East European Collection |publisher=Library.yale.edu |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref>

Besides the Shtokavian dialect on which Standard Croatian is based, Croats also speak [[Chakavian dialect|Chakavian]] and [[Kajkavian dialect|Kajkavian]]. These dialects, and the four national standards, are usually subsumed under the term "Serbo-Croatian" in English, though this term is [[Serbo-Croatian#History of linguistic issues|controversial]] for native speakers,<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/Serbian_Croatian_Bosnian_or_Montenegrin_Many_In_Balkans_Just_Call_It_Our_Language_/1497105.html Radio Free Europe – Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Or Montenegrin?

==History==
{{see also|Serbo-Croatian#Early development|l1=Early development of Serbo-Croatian}}

===Modern language and standardization===

In the late medieval period up to the 17th century, the majority of semi-autonomous Croatia was ruled by two domestic dynasties of princes (''banovi''), the [[Zrinski]] and the [[Frankopan]], which were linked by inter-marriage.<ref>{{cite book |title= A History of Croatia |last=Gazi |first=Stephen |year=1973 |publisher= Philosophical library|location=New York |isbn=978-0-8022-2108-7 |accessdate=15 March 2012}}</ref> Toward the 17th century, both of them attempted to unify Croatia both culturally and linguistically, writing in a mixture of all three principal dialects (Chakavian, Kajkavian and Shtokavian), and calling it "Croatian", "Dalmatian", or "Slavonian".<ref name="fine">{{cite book |title= When Ethnicity did not Matter in the Balkans |last=Van Antwerp Fine |first=John |year=2006 |publisher= University of Michigan Press|location=Michigan, USA |isbn=978-0-472-11414-6 |page= |pages= 377–379 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref> It is still used now in parts of [[Istria]], which became a crossroads of various mixtures of Chakavian with Ekavian/Ijekavian/Ikavian dialects.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kalsbeek |first1=Janneke |year=1998 |title=The Čakavian dialect of Orbanići near Žminj in Istria |journal= Studies in Slavic and General Linguistics|volume= 25|publisher=Rodopi|accessdate=15 March 2012 }}</ref>

The most standardized form (Kajkavian–Ikavian) became the cultivated language of administration and intellectuals from the Istrian peninsula along the Croatian coast, across central Croatia up into the northern valleys of the Drava and the Mura. The cultural apex of this 17th century idiom is represented by the editions of "''Adrianskoga mora sirena''" ("Siren of Adriatic Sea") by [[Petar Zrinski]] and "''Putni tovaruš''" ("Traveling escort") by [[Katarina Zrinska]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matica.hr/Vijenac/vijenac349.nsf/AllWebDocs/Dva_brata_i_jedna_Sirena_ |title=Matica Hrvatska - Dva brata i jedna Sirena |accessdate=9 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.matica.hr/www/wwwizd2.nsf/AllWebDocs/zrinskipvtnitovarvs |title=Matica Hrvatska - Putni tovaruš - izvornik (I.) |accessdate=9 March 2012 }}</ref>

However, this first linguistic renaissance in Croatia was halted by the [[Magnate conspiracy|political execution of Petar Zrinski and Fran Krsto Frankopan]] by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] in Vienna in 1671.<ref name="tanner">{{cite book |title= Croatia: a Nation Forged in War |last=Tanner |first=Marcus |year=1997 |publisher= Yale University Press |location=New Haven, USA |isbn=0-300-06933-2 |page=50 |pages= }}</ref> Subsequently the Croatian elite in the 18th century gradually abandoned this combined Croatian standard.<ref name="malic">{{cite book |first=Dragica |last=Malić |authorlink=Dragica Malić |year=1997 |title=Razvoj hrvatskog književnog jezika|isbn=953-0-40010-1}}{{page needed|date=July 2014}}</ref>

===Illyrian period===
{{main|Illyrian movement}}
The [[Illyrian movement]] was a 19th-century pan-[[South Slavs|South Slavic]] political and cultural movement in Croatia that had the goal to standardize the regionally differentiated and orthographically inconsistent literary languages in Croatia, and finally merge them into a common South Slavic literary language. Specifically, three major groups of dialects were spoken on Croatian territory, and there had been several [[literary language]]s over four centuries. The leader of the Illyrian movement [[Ljudevit Gaj]] standardized the Latin alphabet in 1830–1850 and worked to bring about a standardized orthography. Although based in Kajkavian-speaking [[Zagreb]], Gaj supported using the more populous Neo-Shtokavian – a version of Shtokavian that eventually became the predominant dialectal basis of both Croatian and Serbian literary language from the 19th century on.<ref>{{cite book |title=The development of the Croatian nation: an historical and sociological analysis |last=Uzelac |first=Gordana |year=2006 |publisher=Edwin Mellen Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7734-5791-1 |page=75 |pages= |url= |accessdate=15 March 2012 }}</ref> Supported by various South Slavic proponents, Neo-Shtokavian was adopted after an Austrian initiative at the [[Vienna Literary Agreement]] of 1850,<ref name="malic" /> laying the foundation for the unified Serbo-Croatian literary language.  The uniform Neo-Shtokavian then became common in the Croatian elite.<ref name="malic"/>

In the 1860s, the [[Zagreb Philological School]] dominated the Croatian cultural life, drawing upon linguistic and ideological conceptions advocated by the members of the Illyrian movement.{{sfn|Bičanić|Frančić|Hudeček|Mihaljević|2013|p=77}} While it was dominant over the rival [[Rijeka Philological School]] and [[Zadar Philological School]]s, its influence waned with the rise of the [[Croatian Vukovians]] (at the end of the 19th century).{{sfn|Bičanić|Frančić|Hudeček|Mihaljević|2013|p=78}}

==Distinguishing features and differences between standards==
{{Main|Comparison of standard Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian}}
{{see also|Serbo-Croatian phonology|Serbo-Croatian grammar}}

Croatian is commonly characterized by the ''Ijekavian'' pronunciation (see [[Shtokavian dialect#The yat reflexes|an explanation of yat reflexes]]), the sole use of the Latin alphabet, and a number of [[lexis (linguistics)|lexical]] differences in common words that set it apart from standard Serbian.{{sfn|Corbett|Browne|2009|p=334}} Some differences are absolute, while some appear mainly in the frequency of use.{{sfn|Corbett|Browne|2009|p=334}}

==Sociopolitical standpoints==
Croatian, although technically a form of [[Serbo-Croatian]], is sometimes considered a distinct language by itself.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cvetkovic |first=Ljudmila |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Serbian_Croatian_Bosnian_or_Montenegrin_Many_In_Balkans_Just_Call_It_Our_Language_/1497105.html |title=Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, Or Montenegrin? Or Just 'Our Language'? – Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty © 2010 |publisher=Rferl.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-01}}</ref> Purely linguistic considerations of languages based on [[mutual intelligibility]] (''[[abstand]]'' languages) are frequently incompatible with sociopolitical conceptions of language so that varieties that are mutually intelligible may be considered separate languages. [[Comparison of standard Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian|Differences]] between various [[Standard language|standard forms]] of Serbo-Croatian are often exaggerated for political reasons.<ref>Benjamin W. Fortson IV, Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction, 2nd ed. (2010, Blackwell), pg. 431.</ref> Most Croatian linguists regard Croatian as a separate language that is considered key to national identity.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=39261&lang=en | title = "Jezično" pristupanje Hrvatske Europskoj Uniji: prevođenje pravne stečevine i europsko nazivlje | trans_title = The Accession of the Croatian Language to the European Union: Translation of the Acquis Communautaire and European Legal Terminology | author = Snježana Ramljak; Library of the Croatian Parliament, Zagreb, Croatia | journal = Croatian Political Science Review |language=Serbo-Croatian | issn = 0032-3241 | publisher = Faculty of Political Science, University of Zagreb | volume = 45 | number = 1 |date=June 2008 | accessdate = 2012-02-27}}</ref> The issue is sensitive in Croatia as the notion of a separate language being the most important characteristic of a nation is widely accepted, stemming from the 19th-century history of Europe.{{sfn|Stokes|2008|p=348}} The 1967 [[Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Literary Language]], in which a group of Croatian authors and linguists demanded greater autonomy for the Croatian language, is viewed in Croatia as a linguistic policy milestone that was also a general milestone in national politics.{{sfn|Šute|1999|p=317}}

The terms "Serbo-Croatian" or "Serbo-Croat" are still used as a cover term for all these forms by foreign scholars, even though the speakers themselves largely do not use it.{{sfn|Corbett|Browne|2009|p=334}} In Croatia, this is often based on the argument that the official language in Yugoslavia, a standardized form of Serbo-Croatian, was "artificial" or a political tool used to combine two distinct people.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} Within ex-Yugoslavia, the term has largely been replaced by the ethnic terms Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian.<ref>David Crystal "Language Death", Cambridge University Press, 2000, pp. 11, 12</ref>

The use of the name "Croatian" for a language names has been historically attested to, though not always distinctively; the [[Croatian–Hungarian Agreement]], for example, designated "Croatian" as one of its official languages,<ref>http://www.crohis.com/izvori/nagodba2.pdf</ref> and Croatian became an official [[European Union|EU]] language upon accession of Croatia to the EU on 1 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://daily.tportal.hr/89107/Vandoren-EU-membership-challenge-and-chance-for-Croatia.html |title=Vandoren: EU membership – challenge and chance for Croatia – Daily – tportal.hr |publisher=Daily.tportal.hr |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2010-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/epso/apply/news/news130_en.htm |title=Applications for Croatian linguists |publisher=EU careers |date=2012-06-21 |accessdate=2012-09-10}}</ref> In 2013, the EU started publishing a Croatian language version of its official gazette.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/JOEdSpecRep.do?year=2013&ihmlang=hr|title=Službeni list Europske unije|language=Serbo-Croatian|trans_title=Official Gazette of the European Union|publisher=[[European Union]]|accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref>

In these localities, [[Croats of Romania|Croats]] or [[Krashovani]] make up the majority of the population, and education, signage and access to public administration and the justice system are provided in Croatian, alongside Romanian.

Croatian is officially used and taught at all the [[universities in Croatia]], and at the [[University of Mostar]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

There is no regulatory body that determines the proper usage of Croatian. The current standard language is generally laid out in the grammar books and dictionaries used in education, such as the school curriculum prescribed by the Ministry of Education and the university programmes of the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[Culture of Croatia#Education|four main universities]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}{{update after|2014|8}} In 2013, a ''Hrvatski pravopis'' by the [[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics]] received an official sole seal of approval from the Ministry of Education.

Attempts are being made to revive Croatian literature in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=hrv |title=From Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2005.

The most prominent recent editions describing the Croatian standard language are:

* ''Hrvatski pravopis'' by the [[Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics]], available [http://pravopis.hr/ online]
* ''Rječnik hrvatskoga jezika'' by [[Vladimir Anić|Anić]]
* ''Rječnik hrvatskoga jezika'' by [[Jure Šonje|Šonje]] et al.
*''Hrvatski enciklopedijski rječnik'', by a group of authors
* ''Hrvatska gramatika'' by [[Eugenija Barić|Barić]] et al.

Also notable are the recommendations of ''Matica hrvatska'', the national publisher and promoter of Croatian heritage, and the Lexicographical institute Miroslav Krleža, as well as the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

Numerous representative Croatian linguistic works were published since the independence of Croatia, among them three voluminous monolingual dictionaries of contemporary Croatian.
