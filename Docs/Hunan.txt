'''Hunan Province''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:湖南|湖南]]|p={{Audio|zh-Hunan.ogg|Húnán|help=no}}}}; [[Xiang Chinese|Hunanese]]: [[Shuangfeng dialect|Shuangfeng]], {{IPA-xx|ɣəu˩˧læ̃˩˧|}}; [[Changsha dialect|Changsha]], {{IPA-xx|fu˩˧lã˩˧|}}) is a [[Provinces of the People's Republic of China|province]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is located in [[South Central China]], south of the middle course of the [[Yangtze River]], and south of [[Lake Dongting]] (hence the name ''Hunan'', which means "south of the lake").<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html Origin of the Names of China's Provinces], [[People's Daily Online]].</ref> Hunan is sometimes called for short and officially abbreviated as "[[wikt:湘|湘]]" (pinyin: Xiāng),<ref>[http://www.5xx.cn/data/25461/detail.php?thisid=7604 湖南被誉为三湘四水的由来]</ref> named after the [[Xiang River]] which runs through the province.

Hunan borders [[Hubei]] Province in the north, [[Jiangxi]] Province to the east, [[Guangdong]] Province to the southeast, [[Guangxi]] Province to the southwest, [[Guizhou]] Province to the west, and [[Chongqing]] to the northwest. The provincial [[Capital (political)|capital]] is [[Changsha]].

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2014}}
[[File:Mawangdui silk banner from tomb no1.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Han Dynasty|Western Han]] painting on [[History of silk|silk]] was found draped over the coffin in the grave of Lady Dai (c. 168 BC) at [[Mawangdui]] in Hunan.]]
Hunan's primeval forests were first occupied by the ancestors of the modern [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Tujia people|Tujia]], [[Dong people|Dong]] and [[Yao people]]s. It entered the written [[history of China]] around 350 BC, when under the kings of the [[Zhou Dynasty]], it became part of the [[State of Chu]]. After [[Qin (state)|Qin]] conquered the Chu heartland in 278 BC, the region came under the control of Qin, and then the [[Han dynasty]]. At this time, and for hundreds of years thereafter, it was a magnet for migration of [[Han Chinese]] from the north, who displaced or assimilated the indigenous people, cleared forests and began farming rice in the valleys and plains.<ref>Harold Wiens. Han Expansion in South China. (Shoe String Press, 1967).</ref> The agricultural colonization of the lowlands was carried out in part by the Han state, which managed river dikes to protect farmland from floods.<ref>Brian Lander. State Management of River Dikes in Early China: New Sources on the Environmental History of the Central Yangzi Region . T'oung Pao 100.4-5 (2014): 325–362</ref> To this day many of the small villages in Hunan are named after the Han families who settled there. Migration from the north was especially prevalent during the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] and the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] Periods, when nomadic invaders pushed these peoples south.

During the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] Period, Hunan was home to its own independent regime, [[Chu (Ten Kingdoms)|Ma Chu]].

Hunan and [[Hubei]] became a part of the province of [[Huguang]] (湖廣) until the [[Qing dynasty]]. Hunan province was created in 1664 from Huguang, renamed to its current name in 1723.

Hunan became an important communications center due to its position on the [[Yangzi River]]. It was an important centre of scholarly activity and [[Confucian]] thought, particularly in the [[Yuelu Academy]] in [[Changsha]]. It was also on the Imperial Highway constructed between northern and southern China. The land produced grain so abundantly that it fed many parts of China with its surpluses. The population continued to climb until, by the nineteenth century, Hunan became overcrowded and prone to peasant uprisings. Some of the uprisings, such as the ten-year [[Miao Rebellion 1795-1806|Miao Rebellion of 1795–1806]], were caused by ethnic tensions. The [[Taiping Rebellion]] began in the south in [[Guangxi]] Province in 1850. The rebellion spread into Hunan and then further eastward along the Yangzi River valley. Ultimately, it was a Hunanese army under [[Zeng Guofan]] who marched into [[Nanjing]] to put down the uprising in 1864.

Hunan was relatively quiet until 1910 when there were uprisings against the crumbling Qing dynasty, which were followed by the Communist's [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]] of 1927. It was led by Hunanese native [[Mao Zedong]], and established a short-lived Hunan Soviet in 1927. The Communists maintained a guerrilla army in the mountains along the Hunan-[[Jiangxi]] border until 1934. Under pressure from the Nationalist [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) forces, they began the [[Long March]] to bases in [[Shaanxi]] Province. After the departure of the Communists, the KMT army fought against the Japanese in the [[second Sino-Japanese war]]. They defended the Changsha until it fell in 1944. Japan launched [[Operation Ichigo]], a plan to control the railroad from [[Wuchang, Hubei|Wuchang]] to [[Guangzhou]] ([[Yuehan Railway]]). Hunan was relatively unscathed by the civil war that followed the defeat of the Japanese in 1945. In 1949, the Communists returned once more as the Nationalists retreated southward.

As Mao Zedong's home province, Hunan supported the [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966–1976. However, it was slower than most provinces in adopting the reforms implemented by [[Deng Xiaoping]] in the years that followed Mao's death in 1976.

Former Chinese Premier [[Zhu Rongji]] is also Hunanese, as are the late [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] [[Liu Shaoqi]] and the late Marshal [[Peng Dehuai]].

[[File:1 furong panorama 2012.jpg|thumb|Furong Ancient Town, located in [[Yongshun County]] of [[Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture|Xiangxi]]]]
Hunan is located on the south bank of the [[Yangtze River]], about half way along its length, situated between 108° 47'–114° 16' east [[longitude]] and 24° 37'–30° 08' north [[latitude]]. It covers an area of {{convert|211800|km2|abbrev=off}}, making it the [[List of People's Republic of China administrative divisions by area|10th largest]] provincial-level division. The east, south and west sides of the province are surrounded by mountains and hills, such as the [[Wuling Mountains]] to the northwest, the [[Xuefeng Mountains]] to the west, the [[Nanling Mountains]] to the south, and the [[Luoxiao Mountains]] to the east. The mountains and hills occupy more than 80% of the area and plains comprises less than 20% of the whole province.

The [[Xiang River|Xiang]], the [[Zi River|Zi]], the [[Yuan River|Yuan]] and the [[Lishui River|Lishui]] Rivers converge on the Yangtze River at [[Lake Dongting]] in the north of Hunan. The center and northern parts are somewhat low and a U-shaped basin, open in the north and with Lake Dongting as its center. Most of Hunan lies in the basins of four major tributaries of the Yangtze River.

Lake Dongting is the largest lake in the province and the second largest freshwater lake of China.

[[File:1 fenghuang ancient town hunan china.jpg|thumb|Fenghuang Ancient Town, located in [[Fenghuang County]] of [[Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture|Xiangxi]]]]
The [[Xiaoxiang]] area and Lake Dongting figure prominently in Chinese poetry and paintings, particularly during the Song Dynasty when they were associated with officials who had been unjustly dismissed.<ref>Murck, Alfreda (2000). Poetry and Painting in Song China: The Subtle Art of Dissent. Cambridge (Massachusetts) and London: Harvard University Asia Center for the Harvard-Yenching Institute. ISBN 0-674-00782-4.</ref>

Changsha (which means "long sands") was an active ceramics district during the [[Tang Dynasty]], its tea bowls, ewers and other products mass-produced and shipped to China's coastal cities for export abroad. An Arab dhow dated to the 830s and today known as the [[Belitung Shipwreck]] was discovered off the small island of Belitung, Indonesia with more than 60,000 pieces in its cargo. The salvaged cargo is today housed in nearby Singapore.

Hunan's climate is [[subtropical]], and, under the [[Köppen climate classification]], is classified as being [[humid subtropical]] (Köppen ''Cfa''), with short, cool, damp winters, very hot and humid summers, and plenty of rainfall. January temperatures average {{convert|3|to|8|°C|°F}} while July temperatures average around {{convert|27|to|30|°C|°F}}. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|1200|to|1700|mm}}.

The fourteen [[prefecture of China|prefecture]]-level divisions of Hunan are subdivided into 122 [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]]-level divisions (35 [[District of China|district]]s, 16 [[county-level cities]], 64 counties, 7 [[autonomous counties]]). Those are in turn divided into 2587 [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|township]]-level divisions (1098 [[town of China|town]]s, 1158 [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|township]]s, 98 [[ethnic township]]s, 225 [[subdistrict]]s, and eight [[district public office]]s).

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Hunan|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The politics of Hunan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].

The [[Governor of Hunan]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Hunan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Hunan [[Communist Party of China]] Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Hunan [[CPC Party Chief]]".

== Economy ==
As of the mid 19th century, Hunan exported [[rhubarb]], musk, honey, tobacco, [[hemp]], and birds.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=123|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/123/}}</ref> The [[Lake Dongting]] area is an important center of [[ramie]] production, and Hunan is also an important center of tea cultivation. Aside from agricultural products, in recent years Hunan has grown to become an important center for steel, machinery and electronics production, especially as China's manufacturing sector moves away from coastal provinces such as [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhejiang]].<ref>http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/hunan-province/</ref>

The [[Lengshuijiang]] area is noted for its [[stibnite]] mines, and is one of the major centers of [[antimony]] extraction in China. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Hunan is also well known for a few international makers of construction equipments such as [[concrete pumps]], [[crane (machine)|cranes]], etc. These companies include [[Sany Group]], [[Zoomlion]] and [[Sunward Intelligent Equipment|Sunward]]. Sany is one of the major players in the world. 
[[Liuyang]] is the major maker of [[fireworks]] in the world.

Its nominal GDP for 2011 was 1.90 trillion yuan (US$300 billion). Its per capita GDP was 20,226 yuan (US$2,961).<ref>http://www.stats.gov.cn/was40/gjtjj_detail.jsp?channelid=4362&record=14</ref>

===Economic and technological development zones===
* [[Changsha]] National Economic and Technical Development Zone
The Changsha National Economic and Technology Development Zone was founded in 1992. It is located east of Changsha. The total planned area is {{convert|38.6|km2|abbr=on}} and the current area is {{convert|14|km2|abbr=on}}. Near the zone is National Highways G319 and G107 as well as Jingzhu Highway. Besides that, it is very close to the downtown and the railway station. The distance between the zone and the airport is {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}}. The major industries in the zone include high-tech industry, biology project technology and new material industry.<ref>[http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/changsha-economic-technology-development-zone/ RightSite.asia | Changsha National Economic and Technology Development Zone]</ref>
* Changsha National New & Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone
* Chenzhou Export Processing Zone
Approved by the State Council, Chenzhou Export processing Zone (CEPZ) was established in 2005 and is the only export processing zone in Hunan province. The scheduled production area of CEPZ covers 3km2. The industrial positioning of CEPZ is to concentrate on developing export-oriented hi-tech industries, including electronic information, precision machinery, and new-type materials. The zone has good infrastructure, and the enterprises inside could enjoy the preferential policies of tax-exemption, tax-guarantee and tax-refunding. By the end of the “[[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]]”, the CEPZ achieved a total export and import volume of over US$1 billion and provided more than 50,000 jobs. It aimed to be one of the first-class export processing zones in China.<ref>[http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/binzhou-export-processing-zone/ RightSite.asia | Chenzhou Export Processing Zone]</ref>
* [[Zhuzhou]] National New & Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone
Zhuzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was founded in 1992. Its total planned area is {{convert|35|km2|abbr=on}}. It is very close to National Highway G320. The major industries in the zone include biotechnology, food processing and heavy industry. In 2007, the park signed a cooperation contract with Beijing Automobile Industry, one of the largest auto makers in China, which will set up a manufacturing base in Zhuzhou HTP.<ref>[http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/zhuzhou-hi-tech-industrial-development-zone/ RightSite.asia | Zhuzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone]</ref>
