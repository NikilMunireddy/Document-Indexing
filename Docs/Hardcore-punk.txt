'''Hardcore punk''' (or simply '''hardcore''') is a [[punk rock]] [[music genre]] and [[punk subculture|subculture]] that originated in the late 1970s. Hardcore punk music is generally faster, harder, and more abrasive than regular punk rock.<ref>{{cite book

 | isbn =0-922915-71-7}}</ref> The roots of hardcore can be traced back to [[San Francisco]] and [[Punk rock in California|Southern California]].<ref name=PunkBoys/> The former arose as a reaction against the dominant [[History of the hippie movement|hippie scene]] and was inspired by the New York punk rock and the early [[protopunk]] scene. New York punk rock had a harder-edged sound than its San Francisco counterpart, featuring anti-art expressions of masculine anger, energy and subversive humor. Hardcore punk generally disavows commercialism, the major [[music industry]] and "anything similar to the characteristics of [[Rock music|mainstream rock]]"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Milagros Peña|first=Curry Malott|year=2004|title=Punk Rockers' Revolution: A Pedagogy of Race, Class, and Gender|publisher=Peter Lang|page=56|isbn=9780820461427}}</ref> and deals with social and political subjects.

Hardcore sprouted underground scenes across the United States in the early 1980s, particularly in [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|Washington, D.C.]], [[New York hardcore|New York]], [[New Jersey hardcore|New Jersey]], and [[Boston hardcore|Boston]]—as well as in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[Street punk#UK 82|United Kingdom]]. Hardcore has spawned the [[straight edge]] movement and its associated submovements, [[Hardline (subculture)|hardline]] and [[youth crew]]. Hardcore was heavily involved with the rise of the [[independent record label]]s in the 1980s, and with the [[DIY ethic]]s in underground music scenes. It has also influenced various music genres that have experienced widespread commercial success, including [[alternative rock]], [[thrash metal]], [[emo]], [[nu metal]] and [[metalcore]].

While traditional hardcore has never experienced mainstream commercial success, some of its early pioneers have garnered appreciation over time. [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]'s ''[[Damaged (Black Flag album)|Damaged]]'', [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]]'s ''[[Double Nickels on the Dime]]'' and [[Hüsker Dü]]'s ''[[New Day Rising]]'' were included in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] in 2003 and [[Dead Kennedys]] have seen one of their albums reach gold status over a period of 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=Recording Industry Association of America |publisher=RIAA |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}</ref> In 2011, ''Rolling Stone'' writer David Fricke placed [[Greg Ginn]] of Black Flag 99th place in his 100 Greatest Guitarists list. Although the music genre started in English-speaking western countries, notable hardcore scenes have existed in [[Italy]], [[Punk in Brazil|Brazil]], [[Japanese hardcore|Japan]], [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]].
==Origin of term==
The origin of the term "hardcore punk" is uncertain. The Vancouver-based band [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] may have helped to popularize the term with the title of their 1981 album, ''[[Hardcore '81]]''.<ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title=D.O.A. To Rock Toronto International Film Festival | work=PunkOiUK | url=http://www.punkoiuk.co.uk/news/details.asp?newID=1267 | accessdate = 2006-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author= | year= | title=D.O.A. | work=punknews.org | url=http://www.punknews.org/bands/doa | accessdate = 2006-12-22}}</ref> A September 1981 article by [[Tim Sommer]] shows the author applying the term to the "15 or so" punk bands gigging around the city at that time, which he considered a belated development relative to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington D.C.<ref>Tim Sommer ''Sounds'' 10 October 1981 http://20thcpunkarchives.tripod.com/id62.htm</ref> Hardcore historian [[Steven Blush]] said that the term "hardcore" is also a reference to the sense of being "fed up" with the existing punk and [[new wave music]].<ref name="duo.uio.no">https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/26264/BrockmeierxDUO.pdf?sequence=1 p. 9</ref> Blush also states that the term refers to "an extreme: the absolute most Punk."<ref>Steven Blush. ''American Hardcore: a Tribal History.'' Feral House, 2001. p. 18</ref>

==Characteristics==
An article in ''Drowned in Sound'' argues that 1980s-era "hardcore is the true spirit of punk", because "after all the [[poseur]]s and fashionistas fucked off to the next trend of skinny pink ties with [[New Romantic]] haircuts, singing wimpy lyrics", the punk scene consisted only of people "completely dedicated to the [[DIY]] ethics".<ref>{{cite web|last=Symonds |first=Rene |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/2307017 |title=Features – Soul Brothers: DiS meets Bad Brains |publisher=Drowned in Sound |date=16 August 2007 |accessdate=12 February 2010}}</ref> One definition of the genre is "a form of exceptionally harsh punk rock."<ref>The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition copyright ©2000 by Houghton Mifflin Company. Updated in 2009. Published by Houghton Mifflin Company.</ref> Like the [[Oi!]] subgenre of the UK, hardcore punk can be considered an internal music reaction. According to one writer, "distressed by the '[[art]]'ificiality [sic] of much [[post-punk]] and the emasculated [[sellout]]s of [[New wave music|new wave]], hardcore sought to strengthen its core punk principles."<ref name=Rebelwit/> Lacking the art-school grace of post-punk, hardcore punk "favor[ed] low key visual aesthetic over extravagance and breaking with original punk rock song patterns."<ref name=kuhnvolution/>

One of the important philosophies in the hardcore scene is [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]. The pejorative term "[[poseur]]" is applied to those who associate with punk and adopt its stylistic attributes but are deemed not to share or understand the underlying values and philosophy. [[Joe Keithley]], the vocalist of [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] said in an interview: "For every person sporting an anarchy symbol without understanding it there’s an older punk who thinks they’re a poseur."<ref name=ladouceur2004>{{cite web |last=Ladouceur |first=Liisa |title=Lords Of The New Church |work=This Magazine |url=http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2004/05/lords.php |year=2004}}</ref>

===Musical characteristics===
In the vein of earlier punk rock, most hardcore punk bands have followed the traditional singer/guitar/bass/drum format. The songwriting has more emphasis on [[rhythm]] rather than [[melody]]. Critic Steven Blush writes "The [[Sex Pistols]] were still rock'n'roll...like the craziest version of [[Chuck Berry]]. Hardcore was a radical departure from that. It wasn't verse-chorus rock. It dispelled any notion of what songwriting is supposed to be. It's its own form."<ref name="blush">{{cite journal |last=Blush |first=Steven |title=Move Over My Chemical Romance: The Dynamic Beginnings of US Punk |journal=[[UNCUT (magazine)|Uncut]] |date=January 2007}}</ref> According to [[AllMusic]], the overall blueprint for hardcore was playing louder, harder and faster.<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|author=Pop/Rock » Punk/New Wave » Hardcore Punk |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/hardcore-punk-ma0000002641 |title=Hardcore Punk &#124; Significant Albums, Artists and Songs |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}</ref> Hardcore vocalists often shout,<ref name="allmusic.com"/> [[screaming (music)|scream]] or [[chant]] along with the music.

The guitar sound is almost always [[distortion (music)|distorted]] and amplified, creating what has been called a "buzzsaw" sound.<ref>Steven Blush. ''American Hardcore: A Tribal Tradition''. Feral House, 2001. p. 151</ref> Hardcore [[electric bass|bassists]] use varied rhythms in their [[bassline]]s, ranging from longer held notes (whole notes and half notes) to quarter notes, to rapid eighth note or sixteenth note runs. To play rapid bass lines that would be hard to play with the fingers, some bassists use a pick.<ref name="academia.edu"/> Some bassists emphasize a very technical style of bass playing. According to Tobias Hurwitz, '[h]ardcore drumming falls somewhere between the straight-ahead rock styles of old-school punk and the frantic, warp-speed bashing of thrash."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hurwitz |first1=Tobias |date=1999|title=Punk Guitar Styles: The Guitarist's Guide to Music of the Masters|pages=32 |publisher=WAlfred Music Publishing}}</ref> Some hardcore punk drummers play fast [[D beat]] one moment and then drop tempo into elaborate musical [[Break (music)|breakdowns]] the next. Drummers typically play eighth notes on the cymbals, because at the tempos used in hardcore it would be difficult to play a smaller subdivision of the beat.<ref name="academia.edu"/>

Themes in hardcore punk lyrics have included anti-establishmentarianism, anti-militarism, anti-authoritarianism, environmentalism, anti-violence and other [[left-wing]] and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] political views. During the 1980s, the subculture involved rejection of [[yuppie]] [[materialism]] and American aggressive foreign policy.<ref name=PTWilliams/> Many early hardcore punk bands took [[far-left politics|far left]] political stances such as [[anarchism]] or other varieties of [[socialism]]. Many hardcore bands expressed opposition to political leaders such as American president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Reagan's policies, including [[Reaganomics]] and [[social conservatism]], were common subjects for criticism by these bands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nestorindetroit.com/Music%20Rants/reagan.htm |title=Reagan |work=nestorindetroit.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|archivedate=July 9, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711214651/http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/taxpol/taxpol.htm|url=http://www.house.gov/jec/growth/taxpol/taxpol.htm |title=Tax Policy, Economic Growth and American Families |work=[[house.gov]] |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |date=July 20, 1995 |accessdate=2011-12-04}}</ref> [[Jimmy Gestapo]] of [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]], however, endorsed Reagan and called [[Jimmy Carter]] a "pussy" in a 1986 ''[[New York Magazine]]'' cover story.<ref>http://www.deeplinking.net/media/NYMHC.pdf</ref> Shortly after Reagan's death in 2004, the ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' radio show aired an episode composed of anti-Reagan songs by early hardcore punk bands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radio.maximumrocknroll.com/deadreagan/ |title=Maximum Rocknroll Radio · Dead Reagan Special |publisher=Radio.maximumrocknroll.com |date=2004-06-06 |accessdate=2011-12-04}}</ref>

Many hardcore punk bands would often express politically incorrect messages by putting offensive content in their lyrics and stage antics to shock listeners and people in their audience. Boston band The F.U.'s generated a lot of controversy for their 1983 album "''My America''" which lyrics contained conservative and patriotic views. The album was taken seriously though it was intended as a parody of conservative bands.<ref>{{Cite book|title = American Hardcore|last = Blush|first = Steven|publisher = Feral House|year = 2001|isbn = 9781932595895|location = USA|pages = 186}}</ref> Another band from Massachusetts, Vile, were known to attack women, minorities and homosexuals in their lyrics and would even go as far as putting their albums on the windshields of people's cars.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.killfromtheheart.com/bands.php?id=705|title = Vile Kill From The Heart Page|date = |accessdate = |website = Kill From The Heart|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> On the flipside, [[Tim Yohannan]] and Punk Rock Fanzine ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' were criticized by some Punk Rockers for acting as the "politically correct scene police"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Maximum Rocknroll: Kick-Ass Photos From Iconic Punk Mag|url = http://www.wired.com/2010/05/gallery-maximum-rocknroll/|website = WIRED|accessdate = 2015-10-19}}</ref> while "having a very narrow definition of what fits into Punk" and being too "authoritarian and trying to dominate the scene" with their views.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Notes from Underground: Zines and the Politics of Alternative Culture|url = https://books.google.ca/books?id=n-93CAAAQBAJ&pg=PT102&lpg=PT102&dq=maximum+rock+n+roll+politically+correct&source=bl&ots=Oe7mvfGSFd&sig=NuPmffA_voq64iXGAzuJoUwqRtI&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=maximum%2520rock%2520n%2520roll%2520politically%2520correct&f=false|publisher = Microcosm Publishing|date = 2014-11-29|isbn = 9781621062783|first = Stephen|last = Duncombe}}</ref> During the 2001–2009 United States presidency of [[George W.

==Moshing==
{{further|Moshing}}
The early 1980s hardcore punk scene developed [[slam dancing]] (also called moshing), a style of [[dance]] in which participants push or slam into each other, and [[stage diving]]. Moshing works as a vehicle for expressing anger by "represent[ing] a way of playing at violence or roughness that allowed participants to mark their difference from the banal niceties of middle-class culture."<ref name=BRMartin>{{Cite book|last=Martin|first=Bradford|date=Mar 1, 2011|title=The Other Eighties: A Secret History of America in the Age of Reagan|publisher=Macmillan|page=111|isbn=9781429953429}}</ref> Moshing is in another way a "[[parody]] of violence,"<ref name=PTWilliams/><ref>Palmer, Craig T.

==Clothing style==
[[File:Mike Watt 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Mike Watt]], formerly the bassist for the [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]]]]
Many North American hardcore punk fans adopted a ''dressed-down'' style of [[T-shirt]]s, [[jeans]], [[combat boots]] or [[Sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]] and [[crewcut]]-style haircuts. Women in the hardcore scene typically wore army pants, band T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts.<ref name="BrockmeierxDUO p. 12">https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/26264/BrockmeierxDUO.pdf?sequence=1 Brockmeier, Siri C., ''“Not Just Boys’ Fun?”: The Gendered Experience of American Hardcore'', MA Thesis in American Studies Department of Literature, Area Studies and European Languages ILOS (Universitet I Oslo, 2009) p. 12</ref> The clothing style was a reflection of hardcore ideology, which included dissatisfaction with suburban America and the hypocrisy of American culture. It was essentially deconstruction of American fashion staples—ripped jeans, holey T-shirts, torn stockings for women, and work boots.<ref name=FordeThompson>{{Cite book|last=Thompson|first=William Forde|date=Aug 12, 2014|title=Music in the Social and Behavioral Sciences: An Encyclopedia|publisher=SAGE Publications|page=500|isbn=9781452283029}}</ref> The style of the 1980s hardcore scene contrasted with the more provocative fashion styles of late 1970s punk rockers (elaborate [[punk hair|hairdos]], torn clothes, patches, safety pins, studs, spikes, etc.).

Siri C. Brockmeier writes that "hardcore kids do not look like punks", since hardcore scene members wore basic clothing and short haircuts, in contrast to the "embellished leather jackets and pants" worn in the punk scene.<ref>https://www.duo.uio.no/bitstream/handle/10852/26264/BrockmeierxDUO.pdf?sequence=1 p. 11</ref> Lauraine Leblanc, however, claims that the standard hardcore punk clothing and styles included torn jeans, leather jackets, spiked armbands and dog collars and [[mohawk hairstyle]]s and DIY ornamentation of clothes with studs, painted band names, political statements, and patches.<ref>Leblanc, Lauraine, ''Pretty in Punk: Girls' Gender Resistance in a Boys' Subculture''. (Rutgers University Press, 1999), p. 52</ref> Tiffini A. Travis and Perry Hardy describe the look that was common in the San Francisco hardcore scene as consisting of biker-style leather jackets, chains, studded wristbands, multiple piercings, painted or tattooed statements (''e.g.'', an anarchy symbol) and hairstyles ranging from military-style haircuts dyed black or blonde to mohawks and shaved heads.<ref>Travis, Tiffini A. and Perry Hardy, ''Skinheads: A Guide to an American Subculture'' (ABC-CLIO, 2012), p. 123 (section entitled "From San Francisco Hardcore Punks to Skinheads")</ref>

[[Circle Jerks]] frontman [[Keith Morris]] wrote: "the ... punk scene was basically based on English fashion. But we had nothing to do with that. [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and the Circle Jerks were so far from that.

==Zines==
[[File:UK and US zines.jpg|thumb|upright|UK and US zines]]
In the pre-Internet era, fanzines, commonly called [[zines]], enabled hardcore scene members to learn about bands, clubs, and record labels. Zines typically included reviews of shows and records, interviews with bands, letters, and ads for records and labels. Zines were [[DIY]] products, "proudly amateur, usually handmade, and always independent" and in the "’90s, zines were the primary way to stay up on punk and hardcore." They acted as the "[[blog]]s, comment sections, and [[social network]]s of their day."<ref name="avclub.com">{{cite web|last=Heller |first=Jason |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/with-zines-the-90s-punk-scene-had-a-living-history-104206 |title=With zines, the ’90s punk scene had a living history · Fear Of A Punk Decade · The A.V. Club |publisher=Avclub.com |date=2013-10-15 |accessdate=2014-08-20}}</ref>

In the American Midwest, the zine ''[[Touch and Go (book)|Touch and Go]]'' described the Midwest hardcore scene from 1979 to 1983. ''We Got Power'' described the LA scene from 1981 to 1984, and it included show reviews and band interviews with groups including D.O.A., the Misfits, Black Flag, Suicidal Tendencies and the Circle Jerks. ''My Rules'' was a photo zine that included photos of hardcore shows from across the US. ''In Effect'', which began in 1988, described the New York City scene.<ref name="avclub.com"/> By 1990, ''[[Maximum Rocknroll]]'' "had become the de facto bible of the scene." Maximum Rocknroll is a thick, monthly, newsprint magazine with subscriptions in many countries all over the world. MRR had a "passionate yet dogmatic view" of what hardcore was supposed to be, while ''HeartattaCk'' and ''Profane Existence'' were "even more religious about their DIY ethos." ''HeartattaCk'' was mainly about emo and post-hardcore. ''Profane Existence'' was mostly about crust punk.<ref name="avclub.com"/> The Bay Area zine ''[[Cometbus]]'' "captured an entire dimension of ’90s punk culture that provided necessary roughage compared to the empty calories of [[Pop punk|mainstream punk]]’s [[MTV]]/[[Warped Tour]] narrative."

Other 1990 zines included ''Gearhead'', ''Slug and Lettuce'' and ''[[Riot Grrrl]].''
<ref name="avclub.com"/> In Canada, the zine ''Standard Issue'' chronicles the Ottawa hardcore scene. With the arrival of the Internet, some hardcore punk zines became available online. One example is the e-zine chronicling the Australian hardcore scene, ''RestAssured.''

==History==

===Late 1970s-early 1980s===

====United States====

=====Los Angeles=====
[[Michael Azerrad]] states that "[b]y 1979 the original punk scene [in Southern California] had almost completely died out." "They were replaced by a bunch of toughs coming in from outlying suburbs who were only beginning to discover punk's speed, power and aggression";"[d]ispensing with all pretension, these kids boiled the music down to its essence, then revved up the tempos...and called the result "hardcore", creating a music that was "younger, faster and angrier, [and] full of...pent-up rage..."<ref>{{cite book |last=Azerrad |first=Michael |date=2001 |title=Our Band Could Be Your Life |url= |location= |publisher=Bay Back Books|page=13-14 |isbn=9780316787536}}</ref>Hardcore historian Steven Blush states that for West coasters, the first hardcore record was the 1978 release ''[[Out of Vogue]]'' by the Santa Ana band [[Middle Class (band)|Middle Class]].<ref>Steven Blush. ''American Hardcore: A Tribal Tradition''. Feral House, 2001. p. 19</ref> They pioneered a shouted, fast version of punk rock which would shape the hardcore sound that would soon emerge. In terms of impact upon the hardcore scene, [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] has been deemed the most influential group. [[Michael Azerrad]], author of ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'', calls Black Flag the "godfathers" of hardcore punk and states that even "...more than the flagship band of American hardcore", they were "...required listening for anyone who was interested in underground music."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book |last=Azerrad |first=Michael |title=Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991 |publisher=Underground Music |isbn=0-316-78753-1}}</ref> Blush states that Black Flag defined American hardcore in the same way that the Sex Pistols defined punk.<ref name="duo.uio.no"/> Formed in [[Hermosa Beach, California]] by [[guitarist]] and [[lyricist]] [[Greg Ginn]], they played their first show in December 1977. Originally called Panic, they changed their name to Black Flag in 1978.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Grad |first=David |title=Fade to Black |journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=July 1997}}</ref> Black Flag's sound mixed the raw simplicity of the Ramones with [[Atonality|atonal]] guitar solos and frequent tempo shifts.

By 1979, Black Flag were joined by other Los Angeles-area bands playing hardcore punk, including [[Fear (band)|Fear]], the [[Germs (band)|Germs]], and the [[Circle Jerks]] (featuring Black Flag's original singer, [[Keith Morris]]). This group of bands was featured in [[Penelope Spheeris]]' 1981 documentary ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|82252|The Decline of Western Civilization}}</ref> By the time the film was released, other hardcore bands were making a name for themselves in Los Angeles and neighboring [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], including [[The Adolescents]], [[Angry Samoans]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Dr. Know (band)|Dr. Know]], [[Ill Repute]], [[Middle Class (band)|The Middle Class]], [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[New Regime (American band)|New Regime]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[T.S.O.L.]], [[Wasted Youth (American band)|Wasted Youth]], and [[Youth Brigade (band)|Youth Brigade]].

Whilst popular traditional punk bands such as the [[Ramones]], [[The Clash]], and [[Sex Pistols]] were signed to major record labels, the hardcore punk bands were generally not. Black Flag, however, was briefly signed to [[MCA Records|MCA]] subsidiary Unicorn Records, but were dropped because an executive considered their music to be "anti-parent".<ref>{{cite web |title=Black Flag |work=Sounds magazine |url=http://www.micksinclair.com/sounds/bf.html |accessdate=May 27, 2006}}</ref> Instead of trying to be courted by the major labels, hardcore bands started their own [[independent record label]]s and distributed their records themselves. Ginn started [[SST Records]], which released Black Flag's debut EP ''[[Nervous Breakdown (EP)|Nervous Breakdown]]'' in 1979. SST went on to release a number of albums by other hardcore artists, and was described by Azerrad as "easily the most influential and popular underground indie of the Eighties."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> SST was followed by a number of other successful artist-run labels—including [[BYO Records]] (started by Shawn and Mark Stern of Youth Brigade), [[Epitaph Records]] (started by [[Brett Gurewitz]] of Bad Religion), [[New Alliance Records]] (started by the Minutemen's D. Boon)—as well as fan-run labels like [[Frontier Records]] and [[Slash Records]].

Bands also funded and organized their own tours. Black Flag's tours in 1980 and 1981 brought them in contact with developing hardcore scenes in many parts of North America, and blazed trails that were followed by other touring bands.<ref>[http://www.punknews.org/bands/blackflag Black Flag] on [[Punknews.org]]</ref><ref>{{Britannica|9105869|Black Flag}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526210253/http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/black_flag/bio.jhtml |archivedate=26 May 2009 |publisher=[[VH1]] |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/black_flag/bio.jhtml |date= |title=Black Flag}}</ref> Youth Brigade and Social Distortion were two of the first hardcore punk bands to create a documentary of their tour, releasing ''[[Another State of Mind (film)|Another State of Mind]]'' in 1984.<ref>{{IMDb title|198307|Another State of Mind}}</ref> The Another State of Mind tour was funded by "Youth Movement '82", a concert organized by BYO at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] that—in addition to Youth Brigade—featured [[T.S.O.L.]], [[The Adolescents]], [[Wasted Youth (American band)|Wasted Youth]], [[Social Distortion]] and [[Blades (band)|Blades]].

=====San Francisco=====
[[File:Jello-Biafra.jpg|thumbnail|[[Jello Biafra]] performing with the [[Dead Kennedys]] ]]
Shortly after Black Flag debuted in Los Angeles, [[Dead Kennedys]] were formed in San Francisco. While the band's early releases were played in a style closer to traditional punk rock, ''[[In God We Trust, Inc.]]'' (1981) marked a shift into hardcore. Similar to Black Flag and Youth Brigade, Dead Kennedys released their albums on their own label [[Alternative Tentacles]]. While not as large as the scene in Los Angeles, the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] hardcore scene of the 1980s included a number of noteworthy bands, including [[Crucifix (band)|Crucifix]], [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]], and [[Whipping Boy (American band)|Whipping Boy]].

Additionally, during this time, seminal [[Texas]]-based bands [[The Dicks]], [[MDC (band)|MDC]], [[Verbal Abuse]], and [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles]] (D.R.I.) relocated to San Francisco. This scene was helped in particular by the San Francisco club [[Mabuhay Gardens]], whose promoter, [[Dirk Dirksen]], became known as "The Pope of Punk".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2006-11-22/bay-area/17321473_1_dirk-dirksen-mabuhay-gardens-dead-kennedys | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=KEN GARCIA – S.F.

[[File:Bad brains 1983.jpg|thumb|left|Bad Brains at 9:30 Club, Washington, D.C., 1983]]

The first hardcore punk band to form on the east coast of the United States was Washington, D.C.'s [[Bad Brains]]. Initially formed in 1977 as a jazz fusion ensemble called Mind Power, and consisting of all [[African-American]] members, their early foray into hardcore featured some of the fastest tempos in [[rock music]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~cch223/usa/badbrains_main.html |work=homepages.nyu.edu |publisher=[[New York University]] |title=Bad Brains}}</ref> The band released its debut single, "[[Pay to Cum]]", in 1980, and were influential in establishing the D.C. hardcore scene.

[[Ian MacKaye]] and [[Jeff Nelson (musician)|Jeff Nelson]], influenced by [[Bad Brains]], formed the band [[Teen Idles]] in 1979. The group broke up in 1980, and MacKaye and Nelson went on to form [[Minor Threat]], who became a big influence on the hardcore punk genre. The band used faster rhythms and more aggressive, less melodic riffs than was common at the time. Minor Threat popularized the [[straight edge]] movement with its song "[[Straight Edge (song)|Straight Edge]]", which spoke out against alcohol, drugs and promiscuity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cogan|first=Brian|title=The Encyclopedia of Punk|year=2008|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4027-5960-4|location=New York|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Azerrad|first=Michael|title=Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991|year=2001|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|isbn=0-316-78753-1|location=New York|ref=harv|page=121}}</ref> MacKaye and Nelson ran their own record label, [[Dischord Records]], which released records by D.C. hardcore bands including: [[The Faith (American band)|The Faith]], [[Iron Cross (band)|Iron Cross]], [[Scream (band)|Scream]], [[State of Alert]], [[Government Issue]], [[Void (band)|Void]], and DC's [[Youth Brigade (Washington, D.C. band)|Youth Brigade]]. The ''[[Flex Your Head]]'' compilation was a seminal document of the early 1980s DC hardcore scene. The record label was run out of the Dischord House, a Washington, D.C. [[punk house]].

=====Boston=====
Seminal Boston hardcore bands included [[Jerry's Kids (band)|Jerry's Kids]], [[Gang Green]], [[The F.U.'s]], [[SS Decontrol]], [[Negative FX]], [[The Freeze]] and [[Siege (band)|Siege]].  A faction of the scene was influenced by D.C.'s [[straight edge]] scene. Members of bands such as [[DYS (band)|DYS]], [[Negative FX]], and [[SS Decontrol]] formed the Boston Crew, a [[Hardline (subculture)|militant straight edge]] group that frequently assaulted punks who drank or used drugs. The controversy surrounding this crew and their antics sparked a debate about violence within the hardcore scene. In the late 1980s, [[Elgin James]] became involved in the militant faction of the Boston straight edge scene, and he later helped found the organization [[Friends Stand United]], which would eventually be classified as a [[street gang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/chicago/press-releases/2009/cg071409.htm |title=FBI — Alleged Founder of Street Gang that Uses Violence to Control Hardcore Punk Rock Music Scene Arrested on Extortion Charge for Shaking Down $5,000 from Recording Artist for Protection |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}</ref> In 1982, [[Modern Method Records]] released ''[[This Is Boston, Not L.A.]]'', a seminal compilation album of the Boston hardcore scene.

====Other countries====
Hardcore scenes also developed in Italy, other European countries, Brazil, Japan, and the Middle East.

There was a dynamic [[Italy|Italian]] hardcore punk scene in the 1980s. Inspired by UK bands such as [[Crass (band)|Crass]] and [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], many Italian groups had lyrics that were anti-war and anti-[[NATO]]. Groups included [[Wretched (punk band)|Wretched]], [[Raw Power (band)|Raw Power]], and [[Negazione]]. The [[Last White Christmas]] festival, held in Pisa on Dec. 4, 1983, was one of the most important concert with a lot of Italian groups (CCM, I Refuse It!, Raw Power, Purid Fever, War Dogs, ecc.). Sweden developed several influential hardcore bands, first and foremost Missbrukarna but also D-Beat acts as [[Mob 47]] and [[Anti Cimex]], whose music has also inspired many foreign bands. Since the early 1990s, many Swedish groups were [[D-beat]] "tribute bands" to groups such as UK's Discharge. A hardcore scene that emerged in [[Umeå]] and other northern cities in the 1990s, with bands such as [[Refused]] (Umeå) and [[Raised Fist]] ([[Luleå]]). Finland produced some influential hardcore bands, including [[Terveet Kädet]], one of the first hardcore groups to emerge in the country. In Eastern Europe notable hardcore bands included Hungaria's [[Galloping Coroners]] from 1975, Yugoslavia's 1980s-era [[Niet]] from Ljubljana, [[KUD Idijoti]] from [[Pula]], and [[KBO!]]. 
[[File:Shizuki and Jun Kasai on June 3, 2009.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The drummer of the Japanese band [[Anti Feminism]] in 2009 (on the left, pictured with wrestler [[Jun Kasai]]).]]
In Brazil, the hardcore scene was given a jump start with the opening of a punk record shop called ''Punk Rock Discos'' in São Paulo in 1979. By the early 1980s, the store was bringing records from [[England]], including British bands like [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and [[Disorder (band)|Disorder]] as well as Swedish and Finnish hardcore. Around 1981, punk gigs were happening often around São Paulo, where there were already dozens of active bands, mostly playing hardcore punk and similar styles, most importantly [[Cólera]] and [[Inocentes]].

A [[Japanese hardcore]] scene arose to protest the social and economic changes sweeping the country in the late 1970s and during the 1980s. The band [[SS (band)|SS]] is regarded as the first, forming in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|author=グローバル・プラス株式会社 |url=http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000042455 |title=＜パンクロックの封印を解く＞"東京ロッカーズ"の全貌に迫る『ROCKERS[完全版&#93;』 &#124; V.A.（PUNK） &#124; BARKS音楽ニュース |publisher=Barks.jp |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}</ref> Bands such as [[The Stalin]] and [[GISM]] soon followed, both forming in 1980. Other notable Japanese hardcore bands include: [[Anti Feminism]], [[Balzac (band)|Balzac]], [[Bomb Factory (band)|Bomb Factory]], [[Disclose]] (a D-beat band), [[Garlic Boys]], [[Gauze (band)|Gauze]], [[The Piass]], [[S.O.B. (band)|SOB]], and [[The Star Club]].

In recent years, Muslim hardcore bands have emerged in the US, Canada, Pakistan, and Indonesia. The development of Muslim hardcore has been traced to the impact of a 2010 film ''[[Taqwacore (film)|Taqwacore]]'', a documentary about the Muslim hardcore scene. Bands include "[[The Kominas]] from Boston, the all-girl [[Secret Trial Five]] from Toronto, [[Al Thawra]] (The Power) from Chicago and even a few bands out in Pakistan and Indonesia."<ref>Sanjiv Bhattacharya.

===Mid-1980s===
[[File:COC 1986.jpg|thumb|upright|Corrosion of Conformity playing in Denver in 1986]]
The mid-1980s were a time of transition for the hardcore scene.  Bands such as [[Hüsker Dü]], [[Articles of Faith (band)|Articles of Faith]], and new bands formed by members of bands like [[Deep Wound]] and [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]] experimented with other genres and were embraced by college radio, coining the term "[[College Rock]]".  Many Boston bands such as [[SS Decontrol]], [[Gang Green]], [[DYS (band)|DYS]], and [[The F.U.'s]], as well as Midwestern hardcore bands [[Necros (band)|Necros]], [[Negative Approach]] and [[The Meatmen]] moved in a slower, heavier hard rock direction. [[Crossover thrash]] was another influential movement in mid-1980s hardcore, with bands like [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]], [[Corrosion of Conformity]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Los Cycos]], [[Cro-Mags]], [[Fang (band)]], [[Agnostic Front]], [[Rich Kids on LSD]], [[The Accüsed]] and [[Cryptic Slaughter]] embracing the thrash metal of bands like [[Slayer]]. Most of the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene eschewed hardcore in favor of a [[college rock]]-influenced style of punk.

===Late 1980s===

By the mid to late 1980s, many of the most prominent early hardcore punk bands had broken up. [[Bad Religion]] made a [[progressive rock]] album with ''[[Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)|Into the Unknown]]'',<ref>{{cite web|author=Hobey Echlin |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-03-25/music/bad-religion-house-of-blues-anaheim/ |title=Bad Religion's Recipe for Longevity – Page 1 – Music – Orange County |publisher=OC Weekly |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2011-12-04}}</ref> the [[Beastie Boys]] gained fame by playing [[hip hop]], and [[Bad Brains]] incorporated more [[reggae]] into their music, such as in their 1989 album ''[[Quickness]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/darryl_jenifer_of_bad_brains_i_want_to_be_the_soldier_of_my_music.html |title=Darryl Jenifer Of Bad Brains: 'I Want To Be The Soldier Of My Music' |date=07/12/2007 |publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive]]}}</ref> [[Social Distortion]] went on hiatus after its first album was released, due to [[Mike Ness]]'s drug problems, and returned with a sound based more on [[country music]], which was referred to as [[cowpunk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A69440 |title=A Conversation with Mike Ness of Social Distortion – Music – Music Features – Pittsburgh City Paper |publisher=Pittsburghcitypaper.ws |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}</ref>

====Youth crew====
During the late eighties in New York City, Influenced by original [[straight edge]] bands [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]], [[Minor Threat]], [[Bl'ast]], and [[Uniform Choice]], bands spearheaded a [[youth crew]] movement. An extension to the original pioneers groundwork of lyrically expressing views against drugs, alcohol and promiscuous sex, this rebirth also focused on topics such as [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]].<ref>{{cite web |archivedate=4 July 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040704125825/http://members.fortunecity.com/youthoftoday/Interviews/interv4.htm |title=Tension building interview with Ray Cappo |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |work=[[FortuneCity]] |url=http://members.fortunecity.com/youthoftoday/Interviews/interv4.htm}}</ref> In the late 1980s, most bands associated with youth crew included [[Bold (band)|Bold]], [[Gorilla Biscuits]], [[Side by Side (band)|Side by Side]], [[Youth of Today]], and beyond the New York area to [[Southern California]] bands such as [[Chain of Strength]] and [[Inside Out (band)|Inside Out]].

===1990s===
In the beginning of the 1990s, bands such as [[Born Against]], [[Rorschach (band)|Rorschach]], [[Burn (American band)|Burn]] and [[Drive Like Jehu]] took the 1980s styles of hardcore and pushed them into more contemporary sounds. Many of the bands from this era were strongly influenced by other genres, such as [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], alternative, pop, and even rap. Hardcore subsequently became a broad term, as a variety of different genres arose, such as [[melodic hardcore]] ([[Avail]], [[Lifetime (band)|Lifetime]], [[Kid Dynamite (band)|Kid Dynamite]]), [[emo]] ([[Endpoint (band)|Endpoint]], [[Saves the Day]]), [[D-beat]] ([[Avskum]], [[Aus Rotten]], [[Skitsystem]]), [[powerviolence]] ([[Spazz (band)|Spazz]], [[Dropdead]], [[Charles Bronson (band)|Charles Bronson]]), [[thrashcore]] ([[What Happens Next?

While the 1990s had many different sounds and styles emerging, the genre primarily branched into two directions; ''new school'' metallic hardcore (also  referred as [[metalcore]]), which incorporated aspects of [[thrash metal]] and [[death metal]] for a heavier and more technical sound, and ''old school'', reminiscent of the classic beginnings of hardcore punk. "New school" bands such as [[Strung Out]], [[Earth Crisis]], [[Snapcase]], [[Strife (band)|Strife]], [[Hatebreed]], [[108 (band)|108]], [[Integrity (band)|Integrity]] and [[Damnation A.D.]] dominated the scene in the early 1990s, but towards the end of the decade, a new-found interest in "old school" had developed, represented by bands like [[Battery (band)|Battery]], [[Ten Yard Fight]], [[In My Eyes (band)|In My Eyes]], [[Good Clean Fun (band)|Good Clean Fun]], [[H2O (American band)|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and [[Better Than a Thousand]].<ref>{{cite web |author=[[Revelation Records]] |url=http://www.revelationrecords.com/bands/show/99 |title=Bands: Battery |accessdate=30 August 2009}}</ref><ref>SAVEYOURSCENE.COM.

Many of the bands during this time wrote lyrics about abstinence from drugs, politics, civil rights, animal rights and spirituality.

===2000s===

With the increased popularity of punk rock in the mid-1990s and the 2000s, some hardcore bands signed with major record labels. The first was New York's [[H2O (American band)|H<sub>2</sub>O]], who released its album ''[[Go (H2O album)|Go]]'' (2001) for [[MCA Records|MCA]]. Despite an extensive tour and an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', the album was not commercially successful, and when the label folded, the band and the label parted ways. In 2002, California's [[AFI (band)|AFI]] signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] and changed its sound considerably for its successful major label debut ''[[Sing the Sorrow]]''.

==Subgenres and fusion genres==
{{See also|List of hardcore genres}}
Hardcore punk has spawned a number of subgenres, fusion genres and derivative forms. Its subgenres include [[D-beat]], [[emo]],<ref name=kuhnvolution>{{Cite book|last=Kuhn|first=Gabriel|date=Feb 1, 2010|title=Sober Living for the Revolution|publisher=PM Press|page=16|isbn=9781604863437}}</ref> [[melodic hardcore]] and [[thrashcore]]. Important fusion genres include [[crossover thrash]],<ref name=kuhnvolution/> [[crust punk]],<ref name=kuhnvolution/> [[grindcore]],<ref name=kuhnvolution/> and [[metalcore]],<ref name=kuhnvolution/> all of which fuse hardcore punk with [[extreme metal]] styles. Key derivatives include {{nowrap|[[post-hardcore]]}} and [[skate punk]], and hardcore punk has also influenced a number of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] subgenres.

===Subgenres===

====D-beat====
D-beat (also known as discore or kängpunk) is a hardcore punk subgenre, developed in the early 1980s by imitators of the band [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]], after whom the genre is named, as well as a [[drum beat]] characteristic of this subgenre. The bands Discharge{{sfn|Glasper|2009|p=26}} and [[The Varukers]]{{sfn|Glasper|2004|p=65}} are pioneers of the D-beat genre. Robbie Mackey of ''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' described D-beat as "hardcore drumming set against breakneck riffage and unintelligible howls about anarchy, working-stiffs-as-rats, and banding together to, you know, fight."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11155-live-the-storm/ |title=Disfear: Live the Storm |publisher=''[[Pitchfork Media]]'' |last=Mackey |first=Robbie |date=February 15, 2008}}</ref>

====Emo and post-hardcore====
[[File:Guy Picciotto.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Guy Picciotto]] of Rites of Spring and Fugazi]]
The 1980s saw the development of [[post-hardcore]], which took the hardcore style in a more complex and dynamic direction, with a focus on singing rather than screaming. The post-hardcore style first took shape in Chicago, with bands such as [[Big Black]], [[The Effigies]] and [[Naked Raygun]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/effigies-p23913/biography |title=Effigies – Biography |author=Huey, Steve |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=March 28, 2011}}</ref> while later developed in Washington, DC within the community of bands on Ian MacKaye's [[Dischord Records]] with bands such as [[Fugazi]], [[The Nation of Ulysses]], and [[Jawbox]].<ref name="PosthardcoreAllmusic">{{Allmusic |class=explore |id=style/d12962 |label=Post-Hardcore}}</ref> The style has extended until the late 2000s.<ref name="PosthardcoreAllmusic"/> The mid-80s Washington, D.C. post-hardcore scene would also see the birth of [[emo]]. [[Guy Picciotto]] formed [[Rites of Spring]] in 1984, breaking free of hardcore's self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and deeply personal, impassioned lyrics dealing with nostalgia, romantic bitterness, and poetic desperation.<ref>Greenwald, p. 12-13.</ref> Other D.C. bands such as [[Gray Matter (band)|Gray Matter]], [[Beefeater (band)|Beefeater]], [[Fire Party]], [[Dag Nasty]], also became connected to this movement.<ref name="Blush, 157">{{cite book|last = Blush|first = Steven|authorlink = Steven Blush|title = [[American Hardcore: A Tribal History]]|publisher = [[Feral House]]|year = 2001|location = [[New York City|New York]]|isbn = 0-922915-71-7|page=157}}</ref><ref name="Greenwald, 14">Greenwald, p. 14.</ref> The style was dubbed "emo", "emo-core",<ref name="azerrad, 380">{{cite book|last =Azerrad|first = Michael|authorlink =Michael Azerrad|title =[[Our Band Could Be Your Life|Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981–1991]]|publisher =[[Little, Brown and Company]]|year =2001|location =[[New York City|New York]]|page =380|isbn =0-316-78753-1}}</ref> or "post-harDCore"<ref>{{cite book |title=POST: A Look at the Influence of Post-Hardcore-1985-2007 |last=Grubbs |first=Eric |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=[[iUniverse|iUniverse, Inc.]] |location=[[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington, IN]] |isbn=0-595-51835-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ku91l_blqCUC&lpg=PP1&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=27 |accessdate= March 25, 2011}}</ref> (in reference to one of the names given to the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene<ref>Grubbs, p. 14.</ref>).

====Thrashcore====
Often confused with [[crossover thrash]] and sometimes [[thrash metal]], is [[thrashcore]].<ref name=terrorizer>{{cite journal |title=Powerviolence: The Dysfunctional Family of Bllleeeeaaauuurrrgghhh!! |journal=Terrorizer |issue=172 |date=July 2008 |pages=36–37}}</ref> Thrashcore (also known as ''fastcore''<ref name=MW>{{cite journal |title=Interview with Max Ward |journal=[[Maximumrocknroll|Maximum Rock'n'Roll]] |url=http://www.625thrash.com/interviews.shtml |accessdate=19 June 2008}}</ref>) is a subgenre of hardcore punk that emerged in the early 1980s.<ref name=FH>Felix von Havoc. Maximumrocknroll. Issue 219</ref> It is essentially sped-up hardcore punk, with bands often using [[blast beat]]s.<ref name="MW"/> Just as hardcore punk groups distinguished themselves from their punk rock predecessors by their greater intensity and aggression, thrashcore groups (often identified simply as "thrash") sought to play at breakneck tempos that would radicalize the innovations of hardcore. Early American thrashcore groups included [[Cryptic Slaughter]] (Santa Monica), [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]] (Houston), [[Septic Death]] (Boise) and [[Siege]] (Weymouth, Massachusetts). Thrashcore spun off into [[powerviolence]], another raw and dissonant subgenre of hardcore punk.<ref name="terrorizer"/> Notable powerviolence bands include [[Man is the Bastard]] and [[Spazz (band)|Spazz]].

===Fusion genres===

====Grindcore====
Grindcore is an extreme genre of music that began the early–mid 1980s. Grindcore music relies on heavy metal instrumentation and eventually changed into a genre similar to [[death metal]]. Grindcore vocals, according to [[AllMusic]], range "from high-pitched shrieks to low, throat-shredding growls and barks".<ref name=GrindcoreAllMusic>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/grindcore-ma0000004452 |title=Grindcore |publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Grindcore also features blast beats,<ref name=MacGregor>{{cite web |url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/2945 |title=Agoraphobic Nosebleed - PCP Torpedo / ANBrx |publisher=''Dusted'' |last=MacGregor |first=Adam |date=June 11, 2006}}</ref> According to Adam MacGregor of ''Dusted'', "the blast-beat generally comprises a repeated, sixteenth-note figure played at a very fast tempo, and divided uniformly among the kick drum, snare and ride, crash, or hi-hat cymbal."<ref name=MacGregor /> The band [[Napalm Death]] invented the grindcore genre; their debut album ''[[Scum (Napalm Death album)|Scum]]'' was described by [[AllMusic]] as "perhaps the most representative example of" grindcore.<ref name=AllMusic />

====Metalcore====
[[File:Metallica London 2008-09-15 Kirk and James.jpg|thumb|Metallica at a London concert in 2008]]
[[Metalcore]] is a fusion genre which combines hardcore ethics and heavier hardcore music with heavy metal elements. Heavy metal-hardcore punk hybrids arose in the mid-1980s and would also radicalize the innovations of hardcore as the two genres and their ideologies intertwined noticeably,<ref name=slayerblood>{{Cite book|last=Ferris|first=D.X.|date=Jun 1, 2008|title=Slayer's Reign in Blood|publisher=A&C Black|page=146|isbn=9780826429094}}</ref> resulting in two main genres one being metalcore. The term has been used to refer to bands that were not purely hardcore nor purely metal such as pioneering bands [[Earth Crisis]], [[Integrity (band)|Integrity]] and [[Hogan's Heroes (band)|Hogan's Heroes]].<ref>1948–1999 Muze, Inc. Hogan's Heroes. ''Pop Artists Beginning with Hod'', Phonolog, 1999, p. 1. No. 7-278B Section 207.</ref>[[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]], pioneers of the heavy metal subgenre [[thrash metal]], were influenced by a number of hardcore bands. Metallica's cover album ''[[Garage Inc.]]'' included covers of two [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] and three [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]] songs, while Slayer's cover album ''[[Undisputed Attitude]]'' consisted of covers of predominately hardcore punk bands.

==Influence on other genres==

===Alternative rock===
[[File:The Replacements (band).jpg|thumb|upright|The Replacements]]
Some hardcore bands began experimenting with other styles as their careers progressed in the 1980s, becoming known as [[alternative rock]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Simon |year=2005 |title=Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978–1984 |location=[[London]] and [[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |isbn=0-571-21569-6 |pages=460–467}}</ref> Bands such as [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[Hüsker Dü]], and [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] drew from hardcore they had played earlier in their careers, but broke away from its "loud and fast" formula.
====Grunge====
In the mid-1980s, northern [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] state bands such as [[Melvins]], [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] and [[Green River (band)|Green River]] developed a sludgy, "aggressive sound that melded the slower tempos of heavy metal with the intensity of hardcore," creating an alternative rock subgenre known as [[grunge]].<ref>{{cite book |authorlink=Michael Azerrad |last=Azerrad |first=Michael |year=2001 |title=[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]] |isbn=0-316-78753-1 |page=419}}</ref> Grunge evolved from the local Seattle punk rock scene, and it was inspired by bands such as [[The Fartz]], [[10 Minute Warning]] and [[The Accüsed]].<ref>Pray, D., Helvey-Pray Productions (1996).
