'''Hastings''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|s|t|ɪ|ŋ|z}} is a historic town and [[borough]] in the [[county]] of [[East Sussex]], within the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Sussex]], on the south coast of [[England]]. The town is located {{convert|24|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} east of the county town of [[Lewes]] and {{convert|53|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} south east of [[London]], and has an estimated population of 90,254,<ref name="NStats">{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadAreaSearch.do?a=7&r=1&i=1001&m=0&s=1309271698515&enc=1&areaSearchText=Hastings&areaSearchType=13&extendedList=false&searchAreas=|title=Neighbourhood Statistics|publisher=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref> which makes it the 66th largest settlement in the United Kingdom.<ref name="The Geographist">{{cite web|url=http://thegeographist.wordpress.com/2013/11/23/largest-cities-uk-population/|title=UK Largest Cities|publisher=The Geographist|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>

Historically, Hastings can claim fame from the [[Battle of Hastings]], and later because it became one of the medieval [[Cinque Ports]]. Hastings was, for centuries, an important fishing port; although nowadays less important, it still has the largest beach-based fishing fleet in Europe. The town became a popular spot for 'taking the waters' (therapeutic bathing in the sea) in the 1760s, and then, with the coming of the railway, a [[seaside resort]].

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Hastings- Boats making the Shore in a Breeze, by John James Chalon, 1819.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Hastings- Boats making the Shore in a Breeze, by [[John James Chalon]], 1819]]
The first  mention of Hastings is found in the late 8th century in the form ''Hastingas''. This is derived from the Old English tribal name ''[[Hæstingas]]'', meaning `the constituency/followers of Hæsta'. [[Symeon of Durham]] records the victory of [[Offa]] in 771 over the ''Hestingorum gens'', that is, "the people of the Hastings tribe.", [[Hastingleigh]] in Kent was named after that tribe. The place name ''Hæstingaceaster'' is found in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' entry for 1050,<ref>Eilert Ekwall, ''The Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names'', Oxford University Press, 1936.</ref><ref>Mills, A. D. & [[Room, Adrian]] (2002) "A Dictionary of British Place-names", in: [[Patrick Hanks]] et al. ''The Oxford Names Companion'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2002. ISBN 0-19-860561-7, pp. 895-1264; p. 1061</ref> and may be an alternative name for Hastings. However, the absence of any archaeological remains of or documentary evidence for a Roman fort at Hastings suggest that ''Hæstingaceaster'' may refer to a different settlement, most likely that based on the Roman remains at [[Pevensey]].<ref>Pamela Combes and Malcolm Lyne, "Hastings, Haestingaceaster and Haestingaport: a question of identity," ''Sussex Archaeological Collections'', 133 (1995), 213–24. ISSN 0143-8204</ref>

Evidence of prehistoric settlements have been found at the town site: flint arrowheads and [[Bronze Age]] artefacts have been found; [[Iron Age]] forts have been excavated on both the East and West Hills. This suggests that the inhabitants moved early to the safety of the valley in between the forts. The settlement was already based on the port when the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] arrived in Britain for the first time in 55&nbsp;BC. At this time, they began to [[Iron industry of Ashdown Forest|exploit the iron]] (Wealden rocks provide a plentiful supply of the ore), and shipped it out by boat. Iron was worked locally at [[Beauport Park]], to the north of the town, which employed up to one thousand men and is considered to have been the third largest mine in the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name="OpenLearn">{{cite web|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/history-the-arts/history/beauport-park-east-sussex|title=Beauport Park, East Sussex|date=22 June 2006|work=[[OpenLearn]]|publisher=[[Open University]]|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>

With the departure of the Romans, the town suffered setbacks. The Beauport site had been abandoned, and natural and man-made attacks began. The Sussex coast has always suffered from occasional violent storms; with the additional hazard of [[longshore drift]] (the eastward movement of shingle along the coast), the coastline has been frequently changing. The original Roman port could well now be under the sea.<ref name="Hastings Past">{{Cite book|last=Marchant|first=Rex|title=Hastings Past|publisher=[[Phillimore & Co Ltd]]|location=Chichester|year=1997|isbn=1-86077-046-0}}</ref>

[[Bulverhythe]] was probably a harbour used by Danish invaders, which suggests that ''-hythe'' or ''hithe'' means a port or small haven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Hithe |title=Hithe – the definition of Hithe |accessdate=31 March 2008 |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] }}</ref>

===Kingdom of Haestingas===
From the 6th century AD until 771, the people of the area around modern-day Hastings, identified the territory as that of the [[Haestingas]] tribe and a kingdom separate from the surrounding kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Sussex|Suth Saxe]] ("South Saxons", i.e. Sussex) and [[Kingdom of Kent|Kent]]. It worked to retain its separate cultural identity until the 11th century.<ref name="historyfiles.co.uk">{{cite web|author=&nbsp; |url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsBritain/EnglandSussex.htm |title=Kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxons - Sussex |publisher=Historyfiles.co.uk |date=18 September 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> The kingdom was probably a sub-kingdom, the object of a disputed overlordship by the two powerful neighbouring kingdoms: when King [[Wihtred]] of Kent settled a dispute with King [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]] of Sussex & Wessex in 694, it is probable that he seceded the overlordship of Haestingas to Ine as part of the treaty.<ref name="historyfiles.co.uk"/><ref name=Kirby_124>Kirby, ''Earliest English Kings'', p.&nbsp;124.</ref>

In 771 King [[Offa]] of Mercia invaded Southern England, and over the next decade gradually seized control of Sussex and Kent. [[Symeon of Durham]] records a battle fought at an unidentified location near Hastings in 771, at which Offa defeated the Haestingas [[tribe]], effectively ending its existence as a separate kingdom. By 790, Offa controlled Hastings effectively enough to confirm grants of land in Hastings to the [[Abbey]] of St Denis, in [[Paris]].<ref>{{cite web |title=S 133 |url=http://www.esawyer.org.uk/charter/133.html |publisher=The Electronic Sawyer |year=2014 |accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref> But, the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' for 1011 relates that Vikings overran "all Kent, Sussex, Surrey and Haestingas", indicating the town was still considered a separate 'county' or province to its neighbours 240 years after Offa's conquest.<ref>{{cite web |title=Key events 771 - 1699 |url=http://www.hastingschronicle.net/771-1699.html |publisher=The Hastings Chronicle |year=2012 |accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref>

During the reign of [[Athelstan]], he established a royal [[mint (coin)|mint]] in Hastings in AD 928.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Challis |first=Christopher Edgar |author2=I Stewart |author3=NJ Mayhew |author4=GP Dyer |author5=PP Gaspar  |title=A New History of the Royal Mint |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zz89AAAAIAAJ |accessdate=31 March 2008 |year=1993 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-24026-0|chapter=The English and Norman Mints, c. 600–1158|page=40}}</ref>

=== Medieval Hastings ===
[[File:Manuscript of XIII BC Battle of Hastings.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Duke William of Normandy, stabs King Harold of England at the Battle of Hastings. 14th-century manuscript.]]
The start of the [[Norman Conquest]] was the [[Battle of Hastings]], fought on 14 October 1066, although the battle itself took place {{convert|8|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north at Senlac Hill, and William had landed on the coast between Hastings and Eastbourne at Pevensey. It is thought that the Norman encampment was on the town’s outskirts, where there was open ground; a new town was already being built in the valley to the east. That "New Burgh" was founded in 1069 and is mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] as such. [[William the Conqueror|William]] defeated and killed [[Harold Godwinson]], the last Saxon King of England, and destroyed his army, thus opening England to the Norman conquest.

William caused a castle to be built at Hastings probably using the earthworks of the existing Saxon castle.

Hastings was shown as a [[borough]] by the time of the [[Domesday Book]] (1086); it had also given its name to the [[Rape of Hastings]], one of the six administrative divisions of Sussex. As a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a "bailiff, jurats, and commonalty". By a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589, the bailiff was replaced by a mayor.

===Hastings and the sea===
[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner - The Fish Market at Hastings Beach - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''The Fish Market at Hastings Beach'', [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]] (1810)]]

By the end of the Saxon period, the port of Hastings had moved eastward near the present town centre in the Priory Stream valley, whose entrance was protected by the White Rock headland (since demolished). It was to be a short stay: Danish attacks and huge floods in 1011 and 1014 motivated the townspeople to relocate to the New Burgh.

In the Middle Ages Hastings became one of the [[Cinque Ports]]; [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]], [[Dover]] and [[New Romney]] being the first, Hastings and [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] followed, all finally being joined by [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] and [[Winchelsea]], at one point 42 towns were directly or indirectly affiliated with the group.

In the 13th century, much of the town and half of [[Hastings Castle]] was washed away in the [[South England flood of February 1287]]. During a [[English Channel naval campaign, 1338-1339|naval campaign of 1339]], and again in 1377, the town was raided and burnt by the French, and seems then to have gone into a decline. As a port, Hastings' days were finished.

[[File:Hastings town centre postcard.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings town centre and the Memorial from an old postcard]]
Hastings had suffered over the years from the lack of a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour. Attempts were made to build a stone harbour during the reign of [[Elizabeth I]], but the foundations were destroyed by the sea in terrible storms. The fishing boats are still stored on and launched from the beach.

Hastings was then just a small fishing settlement, but it was soon discovered that the new taxes on luxury goods could be made profitable by smuggling; the town was ideally located for that purpose.<ref name="Smuggling on the Sussex Coast">{{cite web|url=http://www.hmag.org.uk/LocalHistory/|title=Hastings Museum|publisher= ''Smuggling on the Sussex Coast''|accessdate=10 February 2009}}</ref> Near the castle ruins, on the West Hill, are "[[St Clement's Caves]]", partly natural, but mainly excavated by hand by smugglers from the soft sandstone. Their trade was to come to an end with the period following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], for the town became one of the most fashionable resorts in Britain, brought about by the so-called health-giving properties of seawater, as well as the local springs and Roman baths. Once this came about the expansion of the town took place, to the west, since there was little space left in the valley.

[[File:Bottle Alley Hastings.jpg|thumb|right|The double decker promenade that runs from Hastings Pier beyond Marine Court (seen in the distance), with a break at Warrior Square, was built in the 1930s by the borough engineer [[Sidney Little]]]]
It was at this time that the elegant Pelham Crescent and Wellington Square were built: other building followed. In the Crescent is the classical style church of St Mary in the Castle (its name recalling the old chapel in the castle above) now in use as an arts centre. The building of the crescent and the church necessitated further cutting away of the castle hill cliffs. Once that move away from the old town had begun, it led to the further expansion along the coast, eventually linking up with the new [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]].

{{main|Hastings Old Town}}

[[File:Historische Altstadt-Hastings.JPG|thumb|left|George Street, Old town]]
Like many coastal towns, the population of Hastings grew significantly as a result of the construction of railway links and the fashionable growth of seaside holidays during the [[Victorian era]]. In 1801, its population was a mere 3,175; by 1831, it had reached over ten thousand; by 1891, it was almost sixty thousand.

The last harbour project began in 1896, but this also failed when structural problems and rising costs exhausted all the available funds. Today a fractured seawall is all that remains of what might have become a magnificent harbour. In 1897, the foundation stone was laid on a large concrete structure, but there was insufficient money to complete the work and the "Harbour arm" remains uncompleted. It was later partially blown up to discourage possible use by German invasion forces during World War II.

Between 1903 and 1919 Fred Judge FRPS photographed many of the towns events and disasters.  These included storms, the first tram, visit of the Lord Mayor of London, Hastings Marathon Race and the pier fire of 1917. Many of these images were produced as picture postcards by the British Postcard manufacturer he founded now known as [[Judges Postcards]].

In the 1930s, the town underwent some rejuvenation. Seaside resorts were starting to go out of fashion: Hastings perhaps more than most. The town council set about a huge rebuilding project, among which the promenade was rebuilt, and an Olympic-size bathing pool was erected. The latter, regarded in its day as one of the best open-air swimming and diving complexes in Europe, later became a holiday camp before closing in 1986. It was demolished, but the area is still known by locals as "The Bathing Pool".<ref>[http://www.seasidehistory.co.uk/hastings_lido.html ''Seaside History: the Bathing Pool at Hastings and St Leonards'']</ref>

The 2001 census reported over 85,000 inhabitants.

==Government==
[[File:EastSussexHastings.png|thumb|right|Borough of Hastings, shown within East Sussex]]

{{details|Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)}}
Hastings returned two [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from the 14th century until 1885, since when it has returned one. Since 1983, it has been part of the  [[Hastings and Rye (UK Parliament constituency)|parliamentary constituency of Hastings and Rye]]; the current MP, since [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]], is [[Amber Rudd]] of the Conservative Party. Prior to 1983, the town formed  the [[Hastings (UK Parliament constituency)|Hastings parliamentary constituency]] by itself.

Hastings, it is thought, was a Saxon town before the arrival of the Normans: the [[Domesday Book]] refers to a ''new Borough'': as a borough, Hastings had a [[corporation]] consisting of a "bailiff, jurats, and commonalty".<ref name="Hastings Past"/> Its importance was such that it also gave its name to one of the six [[Rape (county subdivision)|Rapes]] or administrative districts of Sussex.

[[File:Hastings Town Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1197481.jpg|thumb|left|Hastings Town Hall]]
By a Charter of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1589 the bailiff was replaced by a mayor, by which time the town's importance was dwindling. In the [[Georgian era]], patronage of such seaside places (such as nearby [[Brighton]]) gave it a new lease of life so that, when the time came with the reform of English local government in 1888, Hastings became a [[County Borough]], responsible for all its local services, independent of the surrounding county, then Sussex (East); less than one hundred years later, [[Local Government Act 1972|in 1974]], that status was abolished.

Hastings Borough Council is now in the second tier of local government, below [[East Sussex County Council]]. The Labour Party has an overall control of the council with 23 seats, whilst the Conservative Party holds 9 seats. The Borough is divided into sixteen [[Wards of the United Kingdom|electoral wards]]; Ashdown, Baird, Braybrooke, Castle, Central [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]], Conquest, Gensing, [[Hollington, East Sussex|Hollington]], Maze Hill, [[Hastings Old Town|Old Hastings]], [[Ore, East Sussex|Ore]], St Helens, [[Silverhill, Hastings|Silverhill]], Tressell, [[West St Leonards]] and Wishing Tree<ref name="Wards">{{cite web|url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/wards/default.aspx|title=Map of ward boundaries|publisher=Hastings Online|accessdate=17 February 2009}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
[[File:East Cliff Lift Re-opening - geograph.org.uk - 1773330.jpg|thumb|left|The East Hill Cliff]]
[[File:Hastings East Cliff.jpg|thumb|right|East Cliff at Hastings]]
Hastings is situated where the [[sandstone]] beds, at the heart of the [[Weald]], known geologically as the Hastings Sands, meet the [[English Channel]], forming tall cliffs to the east of the town. [[Hastings Old Town]] is in a sheltered valley between the East Hill and West Hill (on which the remains of the Castle stand). In Victorian times and later the town has spread westwards and northwards, and now forms a single urban centre with the more suburban area of [[St Leonards-on-Sea]] to the west. Roads from the Old Town valley lead towards the Victorian area of Clive Vale and the former village of [[Ore, Sussex|Ore]], from which "The Ridge", marking the effective boundary of Hastings, extends north-westwards towards [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]]. Beyond [[Bulverhythe]], the western end of Hastings is marked by low-lying land known as [[Glyne Gap]], separating it from [[Bexhill-on-Sea]].

The sandstone cliffs have been the subject of considerable erosion in relatively recent times: much of the Castle was lost to the sea before the present sea defences and promenade were built, and a number of cliff-top houses are in danger of disappearing around the nearby village of [[Fairlight, East Sussex|Fairlight]].

The beach is mainly shingle, although wide areas of sand are uncovered at low tide. The town is generally built upon a series of low hills rising to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] at "The Ridge" before falling back in the river valley further to the north.

[[File:Fossilised dinosaur footprint fairlght cliffs 2007.JPG|thumb|right|Dinosaur footprint found amongst rocks at the cliff base]]
There are three [[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] within the borough; [[Marline Valley Woods]], [[Combe Haven]] and [[Hastings Country Park|Hastings Cliffs To Pett Beach]]. Marline Valley Woods lies within the Ashdown ward of Hastings. It is an ancient woodland of [[Quercus robur|Pedunculate oak]]—[[Carpinus betulus|hornbeam]] which is uncommon nationally. Sussex Wildlife Trust own part of the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1003006 |title=Natural England – SSSI (Marline Valley Woods)|accessdate=6 October 2008|publisher=English Nature}}</ref> Combe Haven is another site of biological interest, with alluvial meadows, and the largest reed bed in the county, providing habitat for breeding birds. It is in the West St Leonards ward, stretching into the parish of [[Crowhurst, East Sussex|Crowhurst]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1001853 |title=Natural England – SSSI (Combe Haven)|accessdate=7 October 2008|publisher=English Nature}}</ref> The final SSSI, Hastings Cliffs to Pett Beach, is within the Ore ward of Hastings, extending into the neighbouring Fairlight and [[Pett]] parishes. The site runs along the coast and is of both biological and geological interest. The cliffs hold many fossils and the site has many habitats, including ancient woodland and shingle beaches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/special/sssi/sssi_details.cfm?sssi_id=1002885 |title=Natural England – SSSI (Hastings to Pett Cliffs)|accessdate=5 October 2008|publisher=English Nature}}</ref>

===Climate===

As with the rest of the [[British Isles]] and Southern England, Hastings experiences a [[maritime climate]] with cool summers and mild winters. In terms of the local climate, Hastings is on the eastern edge of what is, on average, the sunniest part of the UK, the stretch of coast from the Isle of Wight to the Hastings area. Hastings, tied with Eastbourne, recorded the highest duration of sunshine of any month anywhere in the United Kingdom – 384 hours – in 1911.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[TORRO]] | url= http://www.torro.org.uk/site/sunshine.php | title = 1911 Sunshine}}</ref> Temperature extremes since 1960 at Hastings have ranged from {{convert|33.2|C|F}} in July 2006,<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[KNMI (institute)|KNMI]] | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=13&year=2006&indexid=TXx&stationid=1865 | title = 2006 temperature}}</ref> down to {{convert|-9.8|C|F}} in January 1987.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[TORRO]] | url= http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/monitordetail.php?seasonid=7&year=1987&indexid=TNn&stationid=1865 | title = 1987 Temperature}}</ref>  The [[Köppen Climate Classification]] subtype for this climate is "[[Köppen climate classification#GROUP C: Mild Temperate/mesothermal climates|Cfb]]" (Marine West Coast Climate/[[Oceanic climate]]).<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=591125&cityname=Hastings%2C+England%2C+United+Kingdom&units= Climate Summary for Hasting, UK (Weatherbase.com)]</ref>

===Neighbourhoods and areas===
Some of the areas and suburbs of Hastings are [[Ore Valley]], [[St Leonards on Sea|St Leonards]], [[Silverhill, East Sussex|Silverhill]], [[Bulverhythe|West St Leonards]], and [[Hollington, East Sussex|Hollington]]. Ore, Silverhill and Hollington were once villages that have since become part of the Hastings conurbation area during rapid growth.<ref name="Wards"/> The original part St Leonards was laid out in the early 19th century as a new town: a place of elegant houses designed for the well-off; it also included a central public garden, a hotel, an archery, [[assembly rooms]] and [[St Leonard's Church, St Leonards-on-Sea|a church]]. Today's St Leonards has extended well beyond that original design, although the original town still exists within it.<ref name="1066stl">{{cite web|url=http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-history/burtons-st-leonards/burton-st-leonards-history.htm|title=Burton's St Leonards|publisher=1066online|accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>

==Demography==
The population of the town in 2001 was 85,029, by 2009 the estimated population was 86,900. Hastings suffers at a disadvantage insofar as growth is concerned because of its restricted situation, lying as it does with the [[High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] to the north. Redevelopment of the area is partly hampered by the split administration of the combined Hastings and Bexhill economic region between Hastings and [[Rother]] district councils. There is little space for further large-scale housing and employment growth within the designated boundaries of Hastings, and development on the outskirts is resisted by Rother council whose administrative area surrounds Hastings. Rother has a policy of urban expansion in the area immediately north of Bexhill, but this requires infrastructure improvements by central Governments which have been under discussion for decades.<ref name="Local Development Framework">{{cite web|url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |title=Local Development Framework |publisher=Hastings Online |accessdate=17 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309142442/http://www.hastings.gov.uk/ldf/amr.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2006 }}</ref> This situation has now become the subject of parliamentary consideration.<ref>[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmcomloc/351/35113.htm House of Commons Select Committee: Stakeholders in Hastings 2006]</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:hastings-wyrdlight-1201.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional fisher on the shingle beach at Hastings - Rye registration]]

Until the development of tourism, [[fishing]] was Hastings' major industry. The fishing fleet, based at [[the Stade]], remains Europe's largest beach-launched fishing fleet and has recently won accreditation for its sustainable methods. The fleet has been based on the same beach, below the cliffs at Hastings, for at least 400, possibly 600, years. Its longevity is attributed to the prolific fishing ground of Rye Bay nearby.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Peak |first=Steve  |title=Fishermen of Hastings – 200 years of the Hastings Fishing Community| year=1985}}</ref> Hastings fishing vessels are registered at [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], and thus bear the letters "RX" ('''R'''ye, Susse'''X''').

There are now various industrial estates that lie around the town, mostly on the outskirts, which include engineering, catering, motoring and construction; however, most of the jobs within the Borough are concentrated on health, public services, retail and education. 85% of the firms (in 2005) employed fewer than 10 people; as a consequence the unemployment rate was 3.3% (''cf.'' East Sussex 1.7%). However, qualification levels are similar to the national average: 8.2% of the working-age population have no qualifications while 28% hold degree-level qualifications or higher, compared with 11% and 31% respectively across England.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Shopping and retail===
[[File:Entrance to Kings Walk, Priory Meadow Shopping Centre, Hastings - geograph.org.uk - 1197474.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance to Kings Walk, Priory Meadow Shopping Centre]]
Hastings main shopping centre is [[Priory Meadow Shopping Centre]], which was built on the site of the old [[Central Recreation Ground]] which played host to some [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex CCC]] [[first-class cricket|first-class]] fixtures, and cricketing royalty such as Dr. [[W. G. Grace]] and Sir [[Don Bradman]]. The centre houses 56 stores and covers around 420,000&nbsp;ft². Further retail areas in the town centre include Queens Road, Wellington Place and Robertson Street.

There are plans to expand the retail area in Hastings, which includes expanding Priory Meadow and creating more retail space as part of the Priory Quarter development. Priory was intended to have a second floor added to part of the retail area, which has not happened yet and so far only office space has been created as part of the Priory Quarter.<ref>[http://www.hastingsobserver.co.uk/news/local-news/priory_meadow_shops_to_grow_1_1442559 Priory Meadow shops to grow] Hastings Observer]</ref>

===Regeneration===
In 2002 the Hastings and Bexhill task force, set up by the [[South East England Development Agency]], was founded to regenerate the local economy, a 10-year programme being set up to tackle the local reliance on public sector employment. The regeneration scheme saw the construction of the [[University Centre Hastings]], (now known as the [[University of Brighton]] in Hastings) the new [[Sussex Coast College]] campus and construction of the Priory Quarter, which still remains unfinished but now houses [[Saga Group|Saga]] offices, bringing 800 new jobs to the area.<ref>[http://www.seeda.co.uk/news-and-publications/case-studies/recent-case-studies/1/232 Hastings Regeneration] SEEDA</ref><ref>[http://www.seaspace.org.uk/business/news/May/Sea-Space-finalises-plans-for-next-Priory-Quarter-development/145/ Sea Space finalises plans for next Priory Quarter development] Sea Space</ref>

==Culture and community==

===Hastings Detachment - Sussex ACF===
Hastings has an [[Army Cadet Force]] (ACF) [[Detachment (military)|Detachment)]] which is part of the [[List of ACF Units#South East England|Sussex ACF]] group. This detachment is based in the old Territorial Army Unit Building on Cinque Ports Way, and is affiliated to [[Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment|PWRR]].<ref name=acf>{{cite web| url=http://www.sussexacf.co.uk/location_heathfield.htm |title=Heathfield ACF Home| accessdate=3 July 2008}}</ref>

===Events===

[[File:A Giant Mermaid^ Jack in the Green Festival - geograph.org.uk - 1297677.jpg|thumb|right|Jack in the Green giant mermaid processing through Hastings Old Town]]
Throughout the year many annual events take place in Hastings, the largest of which being the [[May Day]] [[bank holiday]] weekend, which features a [[Jack-in-the-Green]] festival (revived since 1983),<ref>[http://hastingsjack.co.uk/ Hastings Traditional Jack-in-the-Green]</ref> and the culmination of the [[Maydayrun]]—tens of thousands of motorcyclists having ridden the [[A21 road (England)|A21]] to Hastings. The yearly carnival during [[Hastings Old Town Week|Old Town Week]] takes place every August, which includes a week of events around [[Hastings Old Town]], including a Seaboot race, bike race, street party and pram race. In September, there is a month-long arts festival 'Coastal Currents' and a Seafood and Wine Festival. During Hastings Week held each year around 14 October the Hastings Bonfire Society<ref>[http://www.hbbs.info/ Hastings Boroughs Bonfire Society]</ref> stages a torchlight procession through the streets, with a beach bonfire and firework display.

Other smaller events include the [[Hastings Beer and Music Festival]], held every July in [[Alexandra Park, Hastings|Alexandra Park]], the [[Hastings Musical Festival]] held every March in the [[White Rock Theatre]] and the [[Hastings International Chess Congress]].

===Theatre and cinema===
There are two theatres in the town, the [[White Rock Theatre]] and the Stables Theatre. The White Rock theatre is the venue of the yearly pantomime and throughout the year hosts comedy, dance and music acts. The Stables stages more local productions and acts as an arts exhibition centre. The Phoenix Arts Centre, based at [[Ark William Parker Academy]] also stages local productions as well as shows put on by the school.

There is a small four screen [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]] cinema in the town, located opposite the town hall; however, there are plans to build a new multiplex cinema as part of the Priory Quarter development in the town centre. The town has an independent cinema called the [http://www.electricpalacecinema.com/ Electric Palace] located in the Old Town and a restored cinema in St Leonards called the [http://kino-teatr.co.uk/ Kino Teatr.]

===Museums and art galleries===
[[File:Former St Nicholas' Church (Fishermen's Church), Old Town, Hastings (IoE Code 294063).JPG|thumb|right|Fishermen's Museum, housed in former St.Nicholas Church. Opened in 1854, it is a grade II listed building.]]
There are three museums in Hastings; the [[Hastings Museum and Art Gallery]], the [[Hastings Fishermen's Museum]] and the Shipwreck Museum. The former two mentioned are open for the whole year while the Shipwreck Museum is open only weekends during the winter, but daily for the rest of the year.

The Hastings Museum and Art gallery concentrates mostly on local history and contains exhibits on [[Grey Owl]] and [[John Logie Baird]]. It also features a [[Durbar Hall]], donated by [[Thomas Brassey, 2nd Earl Brassey|Lord Brassey]]; the hall contains displays focusing on the Indian subcontinent and the Brassey Family. The Fishermen's Museum, housed in the former fishermen's church, is dedicated to the fishing industry and maritime history of Hastings. The [[Shipwreck Museum]] displays artefacts from wrecks around the area.

The [[Jerwood Gallery]] located in the Stade area of [[Hastings Old Town]] is the home for the Jerwood Collection of 20th and 21st century art and a changing contemporary exhibition programme.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Gallery |url=http://www.jerwoodgallery.org/about/the-gallery |publisher=[[Jerwood Gallery]] |year=2014 |accessdate=28 January 2014}}</ref> The project was opposed by many locals who felt that a new art gallery would have been better located elsewhere in the town.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/mar/12/hastings-jerwood-gallery-plans|title=Jerwood meets a sea of disapproval in Hastings | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=12 March 2009}}</ref>

===Parks and open spaces===
There are many parks and open spaces located throughout the town, one of the most popular and largest being [[Alexandra Park, Hastings|Alexandra Park]] opened in 1882 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. The park contains gardens, open spaces, woods, a bandstand, tennis courts and a cafe. Other open spaces include White Rock Gardens, West Marina Gardens, St Leonards Gardens, Gensing Gardens, Markwick Gardens, Summerfields Woods, Linton Gardens, Hollington woods, Filsham Valley, Warrior Square, Castle Hill, St Helens Woods and [[Hastings Country Park]].

==Landmarks==
[[File:Hastings Castle.jpg|thumb|An aerial view of Hastings Castle. Also shown St. Mary in the castle, former church completed 1828. The listed building is now a 500-seat auditorium and exhibition venue.]]
[[Hastings Castle]] was built in 1070 by the [[Normans]], four years after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]]. It is located on the West Hill, overlooking the town centre and is a Grade I [[listed building]]. Little remains of the castle apart from the arch left from the chapel, part of the walls and dungeons. The nearby [[St. Clements Caves]] are home to the Smugglers Adventure, which features interactive displays relating to the history of smuggling on the south coast of England.

[[Hastings Pier]] can be seen from any part of the seafront in the town. The pier was closed in 2006 following safety concerns from the council. In October 2010, a serious fire burned down most of the buildings on the pier and caused further damage to the structure.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hastings Pier fire extinguished after four days|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-11503280|website=www.bbc.co.uk/news|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref> However, the pier reopened on 27 April 2016 after a £14.2m refurbishment.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|title=Hastings Pier reopening delayed by a year|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-32330898|website=www.bbc.co.uk/news|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 February 2016}}</ref>  

[[File:Marinecourtday.jpg|thumb|left|Marine Court]]
Many church buildings throughout the town are Grade II listed including; [[Church in the Wood, Hollington|Church in the Wood]], [[Ebenezer Particular Baptist Chapel, Hastings|Ebenezer Particular Baptist Chapel]], [[Hastings Fishermen's Museum|Fishermen's Museum]] and [[St Mary Magdalene's Church, St Leonards-on-Sea|St Mary Magdalene's Church]].

On the seafront at St Leonards is Marine Court, a 1938 block of flats in the [[Art Deco]] style that was originally called 'The Ship' due to its style being based on the ocean liner [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']]. This block of flats can be seen up to {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} away on a clear day, from Holywell, in the Meads area of [[Eastbourne]].

An important former landmark was "the Memorial", a clock tower commemorating Albert the [[Prince Consort]] which stood for many years at the traffic junction at the town centre, but was demolished following an arson attack in the 1970s.

==Transport==

===Road===
There are two major roads in Hastings: the [[A21 road (England)|A21]] trunk road to London; and the [[A259 road|A259]] coastal road. Both are beset with traffic problems: although the London road, which has to contend with difficult terrain, has had several sections of widening over the past decades there are still many delays. Long-term plans for a much improved A259 east–west route (including a Hastings bypass) were abandoned in the 1990s, but a new road to [[Bexhill-on-Sea]] is planned to relieve the congested coastal route.<ref>[http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/roadsandtransport/bexhillhastingslinkroad/ east Sussex County Council: "Bexhill to Hastings link road"]</ref> Hastings is also linked to [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] via the [[A2100 road|A2100]], the original London road. The [[A28 road]] connects Hastings to [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]], [[Canterbury]] and the [[Isle of Thanet]]. The [[A27 road]] starts nearby at [[Pevensey]].

The town is served by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] buses on routes that serve the town, and also extend to Bexhill, Eastbourne and Dover as part of [[Stagecoach The Wave routes|The Wave route]]. Stagecoach also run long distance buses up to [[Northiam]], [[Hawkhurst]], [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] and [[Canterbury]].
[[Metrobus]] run service 290 from Beauport Park to [[Gatwick Airport]] twice a day in the early morning.

[[National Express Coaches]] run service 023 to London.

===National rail===
[[File:Hastings & St Leonards RJD 100 - excerpt.jpg|thumb|1914 [[Railway Junction Diagram]] of Hastings area lines and stations; the [[Bexhill West railway station|Bexhill West]] branch and the [[St Leonards West Marina railway station|West Marina]] station have since closed.]]
Hastings has four [[railway|rail]] links: two to London, one to [[Brighton]] and one to [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]]. Of the London lines, the shorter is the [[Hastings Line]], the former [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] (SER) route to [[Charing Cross railway station|Charing Cross]] via [[Battle, East Sussex|Battle]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells|Tunbridge Wells]], which opened in 1852; and the longer is the [[East Coastway Line]], the former [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] (LBSCR) route to [[Victoria Station (London)|Victoria]] via [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]], [[Eastbourne]] and [[Lewes]]. Trains to Brighton also use the East Coastway Line. The [[Marshlink Line]] runs via [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]] to Ashford where a connection can be made with [[Eurostar]] services, and is unelectrified except for the Hastings-Ore segment.

A historic [[British Rail Class 201]] "Thumper" can sometimes been seen (and heard) on historic runs to and from Hastings.<ref>[http://www.hastingsdiesels.co.uk/ Hastings Diesels]</ref> This was a regular service from Hastings to Ashford and many locals have fond memories of hearing the trains rumble in and out of Hastings.

Hastings is served by two rail companies: [[Southeastern (train operating company)|Southeastern]] and [[Southern (train operating company)|Southern]].
Southeastern services run along the Hastings Line, generally terminating at Hastings, with some peak services extending to Ore; the other lines are served by Southern, with services terminating at Ore or Ashford.

The town currently has four railway stations: from west to east they are [[West St Leonards station]], [[St Leonards Warrior Square]], [[Hastings railway station|Hastings]], and [[Ore railway station|Ore]]; this latter has been proposed to be renamed to Ore Valley.<ref name="Consultation Report"/> There is also one closed station and one proposed station in the area. [[West Marina Railway Station|West Marina]] station (on the LBSCR line) was very near West St Leonards (on the SER line) and was closed some years ago. A new station has been proposed at Glyne Gap in Bexhill, which would also serve residents from western Hastings.<ref name="Consultation Report">{{cite web|url=http://www.hastings.gov.uk/access_hastings/a2hfinalreport_appx.pdf |title=ACCESS TO HASTINGS MULTI-MODAL STUDY (Consultation Report)|page=324|accessdate=9 May 2009 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028194632/http://www.hastings.gov.uk/access_hastings/a2hfinalreport_appx.pdf |archivedate = 28 October 2007}}</ref>

===Local rail===
[[File:Hastings funicular railway.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''East Hill Lift'': one of the two funicular railways in Hastings]]
There are two [[funicular railway]]s, known locally as the [[West Hill Cliff Railway|West Hill]] and [[East Hill Cliff Railway|East Hill Lifts]] respectively.

The [[Hastings Miniature Railway]] operates along the beach from [[Rock-a-Nore]] to Marine Parade, and has provided tourist transport since 1948. The railway was considerably restored and re-opened in 2010.

A local metro railway service from [[Bexhill railway station|Bexhill]] to [[Ore railway station|Ore]] has also been proposed.<ref name="Consultation Report"/>

===Paths===
The [[Saxon Shore Way]], (a [[long distance footpath]], {{convert|163|mi|km|abbr=on}} in length from [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], [[Kent]] traces the Kent and Sussex coast "as it was in [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times" to Hastings. The [[National Cycle Network]] route NCR2 links Dover to [[St Austell]] along the south coast, and passes through Hastings.

===Historical transport systems===

====Turnpike====
Hastings became part of the [[Toll road|Turnpike road]] system in 1837, when builder [[James Burton (1761-1837)|James Burton]] was building his new town of St Leonards. The route of the road is that taken by the A21 today.

====Trams and trolleybuses====
[[File:Hastings and District Electric Tramways.jpg|thumb|Map of the Hastings and District Electric Tramways]]
Hastings had a network of [[tram]]s from 1905 to 1929. The trams ran as far as Bexhill, and were worked by overhead electric wires, except for the stretch along the seafront from Bo-Peep to the Memorial, which was initially worked by the Dolter stud contact system. The Dolter system was replaced by petrol electric trams in 1914, but overhead electrification was extended to this section in 1921. [[Trolleybus]]es rather than trams were used in the section that included the very narrow High Street, and the entire tram network was replaced by the [[Trolleybuses in Hastings|Hastings trolleybus system]] in 1928–1929.<ref>Robert J Harley, ''Hastings Tramways''. Middleton Press 1993. ISBN 1-873793-18-9.</ref>

[[Maidstone & District Motor Services Ltd|Maidstone and District]] bought the Hastings Tramway Company in 1935, but the trolleybuses still carried the "Hastings Tramways" logo until shortly before they were replaced by diesel buses in 1959, following the failure of the "Save our trolleys" campaign.

==Education==
Hastings has 18 primary schools, four secondary schools, one further education college and one higher education institution.

The [[University of Brighton]] in Hastings offers higher education courses in a range of subjects and currently attracts over 800 students. The university's Hastings campus doubled in size in 2012, with the addition of the new Priory Square building designed by Proctor and Matthews Architects.<ref>[http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2010/100615uch_new.php University of Brighton, News.] Brighton.ac.uk. Retrieved 9 October 2013</ref> This is located in the town centre a short distance from the railway station.

[[File:SCCH plaze building across station forecourt.JPG|left|thumb|Sussex Coast College and Hastings railway station]]
[[Sussex Coast College Hastings|Sussex Coast College]], formerly called Hastings College, is the town's further education college; it is located at Station Plaza, next to the railway station.

The secondary schools in the town include [[Ark Helenswood Academy]], [[Ark William Parker Academy]], [[Hastings Academy]] and [[The St Leonards Academy]]. [[East Sussex County Council]] closed three mixed comprehensive schools: Filsham Valley, The Grove and Hillcrest, replacing them with two [[Academy (English school)|academy schools]], The St Leonards Academy, and The Hastings Academy. The sponsors for the academies are [[University of Brighton]] (lead sponsor), [[British Telecom]] and East Sussex County Council itself. East Sussex County Council provisionally approved the closure of Hillcrest, The Grove and Filsham Valley. The academies were opened in September 2011.

==Religious buildings==
{{Main|List of places of worship in Hastings}}
The most important buildings from the late medieval period are the two churches in the Old Town, St Clement's (probably built after 1377) and All Saints (early 15th century).<ref>Nairn, Ian, and Pevsner, Nikolaus, ''The Buildings of England: Sussex'', Page 119. Penguin, 1965</ref>
There is also a mosque, formerly "Mercatoria School" until purchased by the East Sussex Islamic Association.  The former Ebenezer Particular Baptist Chapel in the Old Town dates from 1817 and is [[Listed building|listed at Grade II]].<ref name="IoE293813">{{cite web|url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=293813&mode=quick|title=Detailed Record: Ebenezer Particular Baptist Chapel, Ebenezer Road, Hastings, Hastings, East Sussex|year=2007|work=[[Images of England]]|publisher=[[English Heritage]]|accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>

==Sport==
[[File:Hastings Half Marathon, Marina, St Leonards - geograph.org.uk - 1204815.jpg|right|thumb|Hastings Half Marathon]]
Every year the [[Hastings Half Marathon]] is held in the town. The 13.1&nbsp;mi (21.1&nbsp;km) race first took place in 1984 and attracts entrants from all over the country, taking runners on a route encircling the town, starting and finishing by the West Marina Gardens in St Leonards.

[[Hastings United F.C.|Hastings United]] is the town's most senior football team, playing in the [[Isthmian League Premier Division|Premier Division]] of the [[Isthmian League]]. It was founded in 1894 and plays its home games at The Pilot Field, which ground used to be home to two other senior clubs; [[St. Leonards F.C.|St Leonards]] and the original [[Hastings United F.C. (1948)|Hastings United]] which folded in 1985. There are football clubs in Hastings that compete in the [[East Sussex Football League|East Sussex League]], such as Hollington United, St Leonards Social and Rock-a-Nore, playing at local parks and recreation grounds about the town. United attracted sports media headlines, when in 2012 they made it to the third round of the [[FA Cup]] for the first time in their history, being the lowest ranked team left in the contest, before going out losing 4-1 to Middlesbrough.

The [[Central Recreation Ground, Hastings|Central Recreation Ground]] was one of England's oldest, most scenic and most famous cricket grounds.  The first match was played there in 1864 and the last in 1989, after which the site was redeveloped as a shopping centre.  It was particularly popular with touring Australian sides who played 18 matches there.<ref>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/ground/57034.html cricinfo website]</ref> [[Hastings and St Leonards Priory Cricket Club|Hastings Priory]] is the town's largest cricket club, having 4 teams playing competitive, as well as a large junior section. The club's home is at [[Horntye Park]], though it also makes use of the facilities at [[Ark William Parker Academy]].

William Parker sees clubs using the school as their base, such as Hastings & Bexhill Rugby Club, Hastings Athletic Club and [[Hastings and St Leonards Priory Cricket Club|Hastings Priory Cricket Club]] 3rd and 4th teams. Other local teams include [[Cinque Ports Rugby Club]] which plays at Grove School, and South Saxons Hockey Club which plays on the astroturf pitch at Horntye Park.

[http://www.hastingsconquerors.co.uk Hastings Conquerors] is the town's only American Football Club. The club was founded in March 2013 by local resident Chris Chillingworth and currently trains at William Parker Sports College. The club made history in June 2013 when it became the UK's first Co-Operative run not-for-profit American Football club.

There are many bowling greens in the parks and gardens located about the town; the Hastings Open Bowls Tournament has been held annually in June since 1911 and attracts many entrants country-wide.<ref>[http://www.hastingsbowlstournament.com/ Hastings Open Bowls Tournament]</ref>

Since 1920 Hastings has hosted the [[Hastings International Chess Congress]]. A testament to its importance is that every World Champion before [[Garry Kasparov]] except [[Bobby Fischer]] played at Hastings including [[Emanuel Lasker]] (1895), [[José Raúl Capablanca]] (1919, 1929/30, 1930/1 and 1934/5), [[Alexander Alekhine]] (1922, 1925/6, 1933/4 and 1936/7), [[Max Euwe]] (1923/4, 1930/1, 1931/2, 1934/5, 1945/6 and 1949/50), [[Mikhail Tal]] (1963/4), [[Tigran Petrosian]] (1977/8), [[Boris Spassky]] (1965/6), and [[Anatoly Karpov]] (1971/2).
