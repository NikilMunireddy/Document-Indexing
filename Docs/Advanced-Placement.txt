{{Advanced Placement}}
'''Advanced Placement''' ('''AP''') is a program in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], created by the [[College Board]], which offers college-level [[curriculum|curricula]] and examinations to high school students. American colleges and universities often grant placement and [[course credit]] to students who obtain high scores on the examinations. The AP curriculum for each of the various subjects is created for the College Board by a panel of experts and college-level educators in that [[Discipline (academia)|field of study]]. For a high school course to have the AP designation, the course must be audited by the College Board to ascertain that it satisfies the AP curriculum. If the course is approved, the school may use the AP designation and the course will be publicly listed on the AP Course Ledger.  <ref>{{cite web|title=AP Course Ledger|url=https://apcourseaudit.epiconline.org/ledger/|work=AP Course Audit|publisher=University of Oregon|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, the most taken AP exam was [[AP English Language and Composition|English Language and Composition]] with 476,277 students, and the least taken AP exam was [[AP Japanese Language and Culture|Japanese Language and Culture]] with 1,169 students.<ref>{{cite web|title=Student Score Distributions|url=http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/research/2013/STUDENT-SCORE-DISTRIBUTIONS-2013.pdf|publisher=[[College Board]]|accessdate=5 January 2014|pages=2–3|year=2013}}</ref>

==History==
After the end of [[World War II]], the [[Ford Foundation]] created a fund that supported committees studying education.<ref>{{cite web | title = A Brief History of the Advanced Placement Program | url=http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/ap/ap_history_english.pdf | accessdate =January 29, 2009 | publisher=[[College Board]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090205075824/http://www.collegeboard.com/prod_downloads/about/news_info/ap/ap_history_english.pdf| archivedate= February 5, 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The program, which was then referred to as the "Kenyon Plan,"<ref>{{cite web | title = Historical Markers: Kenyon College | url=https://lbis.kenyon.edu/sca/markers/college | accessdate =May 29, 2011 | publisher=[[Kenyon College]]}}</ref> was founded and pioneered at [[Kenyon College]] in Gambier, Ohio, by the then college president Gordon Chalmers.  The first study was conducted by three prep schools—the [[Lawrenceville School]], [[Phillips Academy]] and [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]—and three universities—[[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]] and [[Yale University]]. In 1952 they issued the report ''General Education in School and College: A Committee Report'' which recommended allowing high school seniors to study college level material and to take achievement exams that allowed them to attain college credit for this work.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Liberal Arts in School and College|author=Stanley N.

 | publisher= [[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]
 | accessdate =January 21, 2011}}</ref> The second committee, the Committee on Admission with Advanced Standing, developed and implemented the plan to choose a curriculum. A pilot program was run in 1952 which covered eleven disciplines.

The [[College Board]], a non-profit organization<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.com/about/index.html About the College Board] from collegeboard.com</ref> based in New York City, has run the AP program since 1955.<ref>[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/program/history/8019.html The History of the AP Program] from collegeboard.com</ref> From 1965 to 1989, [[Harlan Hanson]] was the director of the Advanced Placement Program.<ref>{{cite web|last=DiYanni|first=Robert |title=The History of AP Program |url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/21502.html |year=2008 |publisher= CollegeBoard.com |accessdate=July 23, 2009}}</ref> It develops and maintains guidelines for the teaching of higher level courses in various subject areas. In addition, it supports teachers of AP courses, and supports universities.<ref>[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/program/index.html The Advanced Placement Program] from collegeboard.com</ref> These activities are funded through fees charged to students taking AP Exams.

In 2006, over one million students took over two million Advanced Placement examinations.<ref>[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap06_prog_summary_rpt.pdf Program Summary Report 2006] from collegeboard.com</ref> Many high schools in the United States offer AP courses,<ref>[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap05_apfactsheet_37491.pdf AP Fact Sheet] from collegeboard.com</ref> though the College Board allows any student to take any examination, regardless of participation in its respective course.<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/about_faq.html#faq1 AP: Frequently Asked Questions] from collegeboard.com</ref> Therefore, [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] students and students from schools that do not offer AP courses have an equal opportunity to take the examination.

As of the 2015 testing season, exams cost $91 each,<ref>https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/takingtheexam/exam-fees</ref> though the cost may be subsidized by local or state programs. Financial aid is available for students who qualify for it; the exam reduction is $26 or $28 per exam from College Board plus an additional $8 rebate per fee-reduced exam from the school. There may be further reductions depending on the state. Out of the $89, $8 goes directly to the school to pay for the administration of the test, which some schools will reduce to lower the cost to the student.

On April 3, 2008, the College Board announced that four AP courses – French Literature, Latin Literature, Computer Science AB, and Italian Language and Culture – would be discontinued after the 2008–2009 school year due to lack of  funding.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/04/03/ST2008040303977.html |title= AP Language, Computer Courses Cut |work=The Washington Post |date= April 4, 2008| accessdate=2011-01-21 | first=Daniel | last=de Vise}}</ref><ref>[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/teachers_corner/195950.html Important Announcement about AP Italian Language and Culture] from collegeboard.com</ref> However, the Italian Language and Culture test was again offered beginning in 2011.

Starting July 2013 AP allowed students for the first time to both view and send their scores online.<ref>[https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apscores AP Online Scores]</ref>

The number of AP exams administered each year has seen a steady increase over the past decade. In 2003, 175,860 English Language and Composition exams were administered. By 2013, this number had risen to 476,277, or an increase of 171%. Such an increase has occurred in nearly all AP exams offered, with the AP Psychology exam seeing a 281% increase over the past decade.

==Scoring==
AP tests are scored on a 1 to 5 scale as follows:<ref>[http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/exgrd_set.html AP: The Score-Setting Process] from Collegeboard.com</ref>

*'''5''' – Extremely well qualified
*'''4''' – Well qualified
*'''3''' – Qualified
*'''2''' – Possibly qualified
*'''1''' – No recommendation
The multiple choice component of the exam is scored by computer, while the free response and essay portions are scored by trained Readers at the AP Reading each June.  The scores on various components are weighted and combined into a raw Composite Score.  The Chief Reader for each exam then decides on the grade cutoffs for that year's exam, which determine how the Composite Scores are converted into the final grades.   During the process a number of reviews and statistical analyses are performed to ensure that the grading is reliable.  The overall goal is for the grades to reflect an absolute scale of performance which can be compared from year to year.<ref>{{cite web| title= AP Central – Exam Scoring | url= http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/1994.html | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080113162234/http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/1994.html| archivedate=January 13, 2008| publisher=[[College Board]] }}</ref>

Some colleges use AP test scores to exempt students from introductory coursework, others use them to place students in higher designated courses, and some do both.  Each college's policy is different (see link below), but most require a minimum score of 3 or 4 to receive college credit.<ref>[http://pathaspire.com/standardized/ap/ap/1/ Understanding AP Exams] from PathAspire.com</ref> Typically, this appears as a "CR" grade on the college transcript, although some colleges and universities will award an A grade for a 5 score.<ref>[http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/courses/212187.html Multiple-Choice Scores] from collegeboard.com</ref> Some countries, such as Germany, that do not offer general admission to their universities and colleges for holders of an American high school diploma without preparatory courses will directly admit students who have completed a specific set of AP tests, depending on the subject they wish to study there.

In addition, completing AP courses help students qualify for various types of scholarships. According to the College Board, 31 percent of colleges and universities look at AP experience when making scholarship decisions.<ref>

</ref>

Beginning with the May 2011 AP Exam administration, the College Board changed the scoring method of AP Exams.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Guess What? Taking AP Exams Just Got Easier | publisher = ParentDish | year = 2010 | url = http://www.parentdish.com/2010/08/12/guess-what-taking-ap-exams-just-got-easier/|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/08/11/ap-eliminates-guessing-pe_n_678757.html |work=Huffington Post | first=Leah | last=Finnegan | title=AP Eliminates Guessing Penalty On Tests | date=August 11, 2010}}</ref> Total scores on the multiple-choice section are now based on the number of questions answered correctly. Points are no longer deducted for incorrect answers and, as was the case before, no points are awarded for unanswered questions. However, scoring requirements have also been increased.

==Score reporting==
Starting with the May 2013 AP Examination Administration, the College Board launched an Internet-based score reporting service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Score Reporting Services|url=http://www.apscore.org/schedule.html|publisher=[[College Board]]|accessdate=4 July 2013|pages=1|year=2013}}</ref> Students can use their 2013 AP Number or Student Number (if one was indicated), along with a College Board Account,<ref>{{cite web|title=Create a CollegeBoard Account|url=https://account.collegeboard.org/iamweb/smartRegister|publisher=[[College Board]]|accessdate=4 July 2013|pages=1|year=2013}}</ref> to access current and previous years' exam scores. This system can also be used to send scores to colleges and universities for which a 4-digit institutional code<ref>{{cite web|title=List of 4-digit Institutional Codes, PDF|url=http://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_aidi_fellowships.pdf|publisher=[[Educational Testing Service]]|accessdate=4 July 2013|pages=1|year=2013}}</ref> is assigned.

==Exam subsidies==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Recognizing that the cost could be an impediment to students of limited means, a number of states and municipalities independent of the [[College Board]] have partially or fully subsidized the cost.  For example, the state of Florida reimburses schools districts for the exam costs of students enrolled in Advanced Placement courses. The [[Los Angeles Unified School District]], the [[Montebello Unified School District]], the [[Hawaii Department of Education]], [[New York City Department of Education]], and the state of Indiana subsidize all AP Examination fees in subjects of math and science, and the [[Edmonds School District]] in suburban Seattle currently subsidizes Advanced Placement fees of students who enroll in the free school lunch program. In addition, some school districts offer free tests to all students enrolled in any Advanced Placement class.

==Advanced Placement courses==
There are currently 37 courses and exams available through the AP Program. A complete list can be found below:

==Criticism==

===Passing scores and university credit===
Faculty at a number of universities have expressed doubts about the value of a passing AP score. Highly capable students who receive scores of 3 or 4, not 5, are being given college credit at fewer universities. Academic departments also criticise the increasing proportion of students who take and pass AP courses but are not ready for college-level work.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Zimar |first1=Heather |year=2005 |title=Universities Raise Standards for Earning Advanced Placement Credit |journal=SEM Source: An Update on State of the Art Student Services |volume= |issue=January 2005 |pages= |publisher=American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers |doi= |url=http://www2.aacrao.org/sem/index.cfm?fa=view&id=2439 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>

===Academic achievement===
Independent researchers in education have since 2010 studied the impact of the Advanced Placement program on students' academic achievement. An early study published in ''AP: A critical examination of the Advanced Placement program'' found that students who took AP courses in the sciences but failed the AP exam performed no better in college science courses than students without any AP course at all. Referring to students who complete the course but fail the exam, the head researcher, Phillip M. Sadler stated in an interview that "research shows that they don’t appear to have learned anything during the year, so there is probably a better course for them".<ref name="hood">{{cite journal |last1=Hood |first1=Lucy |last2=Sadler |first2=Philip M. |year=2010 |title=Putting AP to the Test: New research assesses the Advanced Placement program |journal=Harvard Education Letter |volume=26 |issue=May/June 2010 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.hepg.org/hel/article/466#home |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>

Two other studies compared non-AP students with AP students who had not taken their course's AP exam, had taken the AP exam but did not pass it, or had passed the AP exam. Like Sadler's study, both found that AP students who passed their exam scored highest in other measures of academic achievement.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ackerman|first1=Phillip|last2=Kanfer|first2=Ruth|last3=Calderwood|first3=Charles|title=High school Advanced Placement and student performance in college: STEM majors, non-STEM majors, and gender differences|journal=Teachers College Record|date=2013|volume=115|issue=10|pages=1–43|ref=Ackerman et al. (2013)}}</ref> The largest study of this sort, with a sample size of over 90,000 replicated these results and also showed that non-AP students performed had equal levels of academic achievement as AP students who did not take their course's AP exam—even after controlling for over 70 intervening variables.<ref name="Warne et al. (2015)">{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Larsen|first2=Ross|last3=Anderson|first3=Braydon|last4=Odasso|first4=Alyce J.|title=The impact of participation in the Advanced Placement program on students' college admissions test scores|journal=The Journal of Educational Research|date=2015|volume=108|issue=5|pages=400–416|doi=10.1080/00220671.2014.917253|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00220671.2014.917253}}</ref> This led the authors to state that AP participation "... is not beneficial to students who merely enroll in the courses ..."<ref name="Warne et al. (2015)" /><sup>:p.414</sup>

===School quality===
Several states use Advanced Placement data for accountability purposes, and [[U.S. News and World Report]] use data on Advanced Placement course offerings and participation to rank high schools.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Morse|first1=Robert|title=How U.S. News Calculated the 2015 Best High Schools Rankings|url=http://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/articles/how-us-news-calculated-the-rankings|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref> However, studies of local school districts
<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lichten|first1=William|title=Whither Advanced Placement--now|date=2010|publisher=Harvard Education Press|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=233–243}}</ref> and the United States as a whole<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell|last2=Anderson|first2=Braydon|title=The Advanced Placement program's impact on academic achievement|journal=New Educational Foundations|issue=4|pages=32–54|url=http://www.newfoundations.com/NEFpubs/NEF4sum2015.pdf}}</ref> show that increasing AP participation does not increase the overall academic achievement or school quality at the group (e.g., high school, racial/ethnic group, nation) level. This led one researcher to state, "Clearly, offering AP alone will not magically turn a failing school into a successful one."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=Pushing students to take Advanced Placement courses does not help anyone|url=https://theconversation.com/pushing-students-to-take-advanced-placement-courses-does-not-help-anyone-45350|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>
