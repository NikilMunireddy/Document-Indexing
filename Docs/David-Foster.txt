==Career==

===1971–1999===
Foster was a keyboardist for the [[popular music|pop]] group [[Skylark (Canadian band)|Skylark]], discovered by Eirik Wangberg. The band's song, "[[Wildflower (Skylark song)|Wildflower]]", was a top ten hit in 1973.<ref name=Encyclopedia.com /> When the band disbanded, Foster remained in Los Angeles<ref name=Encyclopedia.com /> and together with [[Jay Graydon]] he formed the band [[Airplay (band)|Airplay]], whose album of the same name is often labeled as important within the west coast [[adult-oriented rock|AOR]] genre. In 1975, he played on [[George Harrison]]'s album ''[[Extra Texture]]''. He followed that up by playing the Fender Rhodes and clavinet on Harrison's album ''[[Thirty Three & 1/3]]'' a year later. In 1976 Foster joined Guthrie Thomas on Thomas' 2nd Capitol Records album, "Lie's and Alibi's," with Ringo Starr and a host of many other famed performers. Foster was a major contributor to the 1979 Earth, Wind and Fire album ''[[I Am (Earth, Wind & Fire album)|I Am]]'', both as a studio player and arranger, as well as being a cowriter on six of the album's tracks.  The most noteworthy being the song "[[After the Love Has Gone]]" for which Foster, and his cowriters Jay Graydon and Bill Champlin, won the 1980 [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song]].

Foster worked as an album producer on albums for [[The Tubes]]: 1981's ''[[The Completion Backward Principle]]'', and 1983's ''[[Outside Inside (The Tubes album)|Outside Inside]]''.  Foster cowrote such songs as "Talk to Ya Later", the Top 40 hit "Don't Want to Wait Anymore," and the number 10 US hit "[[She's a Beauty]]". The 1980 [[Boz Scaggs]] album ''[[Middle Man (album)|Middle Man]]'' saw Foster cowrite and play keyboard on some of Scaggs's most successful songs, including "Breakdown Dead Ahead", "Jojo", and "Simone", followed by "[[Look What You've Done to Me]]" from ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''.

Foster is a major contributor to Chicago's career in the early and middle 1980s, having worked as the band’s producer on ''[[Chicago 16]]'' (1982), their biggest-selling multi-platinum album ''[[Chicago 17]]'' (1984), and ''[[Chicago 18]]'' (1986).  As was typical of his producing projects from this time period, Foster was a cowriter on songs such as the US Chart No. 1 hit "[[Hard to Say I'm Sorry]]", "[[Love Me Tomorrow]]" (US No. 22), "[[Stay the Night (Chicago song)|Stay the Night]]" (US No. 16), and "[[You're the Inspiration]]" (US No. 3). These four songs were cowritten with the band’s lead vocalist [[Peter Cetera]]. Foster also helped Cetera cowrite (along with Cetera's wife Diane Nini) his US No. 1 solo hit "[[Glory of Love]]" in 1986.  Foster cowrote [[Kenny Loggins]]'s songs "[[Forever (Kenny Loggins song)|Forever]]" (US No. 40), from the 1985 album ''[[Vox Humana (Kenny Loggins album)|Vox Humana]]'', and "Heart to Heart" (US No. 15), from the 1982 album ''[[High Adventure]]''. Foster also worked with Country singer [[Kenny Rogers]] on the hit albums ''[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers album)|What About Me?]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Heart of the Matter (Kenny Rogers album)|The Heart of the Matter]]'' (1985), both issued by [[RCA]]; the latter of which featured "[[The Best of Me (Kenny Rogers song)|The Best of Me]]" a song co-written by Marx that was covered by [[Cliff Richard]] in 1989, resulting in a number-two UK hit.

In 1985, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named Foster the "master of ... bombastic pop kitsch".<ref name="Vox Humana album review, Rolling Stone">{{ cite journal | last=Shewey | first=Don | url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/kennyloggins/albums/album/216344/review/5940971/vox_humana | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412004950/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/kennyloggins/albums/album/216344/review/5940971/vox_humana | archivedate=April 12, 2010 | date=June 6, 1985 | title=Album Reviews: Kenny Loggins: ''Vox Humana'' | magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> That year, Foster composed the score for the film ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0090060/fullcredits#cast|title=St. Elmo's Fire (1985)|work=IMDb|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref> including the instrumental "Love Theme from St. Elmo's Fire", which hit No. 15 on the US pop charts. Another song from the film, "[[St. Elmo's Fire (Man in Motion)]]", recorded by [[John Parr]], hit No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on September 7, 1985.

| quote = That was in 2000. Mulroney, an enthusiastic crooner himself, loved the material and promptly hired Bublé. Among the wedding guests was an old Mulroney friend, record producer David Foster, whose résumé includes a veritable Who's Who of pop musicians. Among them: Celine Dion, Barbara Streisand, the Bee Gees, the Corrs, Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton.
