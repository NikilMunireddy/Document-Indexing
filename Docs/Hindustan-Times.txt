== History ==
''Hindustan Times'' was founded in 1924 by [[Sunder Singh Lyallpuri]], founder-father of the [[Akali movement]] and the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]] in [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HindustanTimes|url=<!--dead link: http://www.urduyouthforum.org/news_Hindustan_Times_bio.php -->http://urduyouthforum.org/newsworld/biography-HINDUSTAN-TIMES.html |publisher=Urduyouthforum.org|accessdate=2016-04-11}}</ref>  S Mangal Singh Gill (Tesildar) and S. Chanchal Singh (Jandiala, Jalandhar) were made in charge of the newspaper. [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and [[Tara Singh (activist)|Tara Singh]] were among the members of the Managing Committee. The Managing Chairman and Chief Patron was Master Sunder Singh Lyallpuri.

K. M. Panikkar was its first editor; [[Devdas Gandhi]] (son of [[Mahatma Gandhi]]) on the editor's panel, and later editor.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shobhana Bhartia wants to benchmark HT with the best in the world|url=http://m.businesstoday.in//story/ht-group-shobhana-bhartia-in-most-powerful-business-women/1/188386.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=[[Business Today (business magazine)|''Business Today'']]|date=14 October 2012}}</ref>  The opening ceremony was performed by Mahatma Gandhi on 26 September 1924. The first issue was published from Naya Bazar, [[Delhi]] (now Swami Sharda Nand Marg). It contained writings and articles from C. F. Andrews, St. Nihal Singh, Maulana Mohammad Ali, [[Cattamanchi Ramalinga Reddy]], T. L. Vaswani, Ruchi Ram Sahni, Bernard Haton, Harinder Nath Chattopadhyaya, Dr Saifuddin Kichlu and Rubi Waston etc.

{{quote|Sadar Panikkar launched the ''Hindustan Times'' as a serious nationalist newspaper. As an Oxonian, historian, and litterateur, Panikkar must have hoped to make his paper eventually more than an Akali sheet. He became the editor and funds flowed freely from activist Akali patrons. He exerted himself strenuously, but the paper made very little headway. In two years Panikkar could not take the print order any higher than 3,000. By then the Akali movement appeared to lose steam and funds dried up. The paper was saved from an untimely demise when [[Madan Mohan Malaviya|'''Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya''']] stepped in to realise his vision of a newspaper in Delhi.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv| last=George| first=T.

Malaviya raised {{INR}}50,000 rupees to acquire the ''Hindustan Times'' along with the help of nationalist leaders Lajpat Rai and M. R. Jayakar and industrialist G. D. Birla, who paid most of the cash. Birla took full control of the paper in 1933. The paper continues to be owned by the Birla family.

It has its roots in the [[Indian independence movement]] of the first half of the twentieth century and even faced the noted "''Hindustan Times'' Contempt Case (August–November, 1941)" at [[Allahabad High Court]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Hindustan Times Contempt Case (August–November, 1941) |year=2007|publisher=READ BOOKS|location= |isbn=1-4067-6748-4 |page=283 |url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=XtYhsX39MKQC&pg=PA316&dq=Hindustan+Times+Contempt+Case#v=onepage&q=&f=false |ref= |accessdate=}}</ref> It was edited at times by many important people in India, including [[Devdas Gandhi]], Sri Mulgaonkar, B.G.Verghese and [[Khushwant Singh]].
