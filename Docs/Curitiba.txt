'''Curitiba''' (<small>[[Old Tupi language|Tupi]]:</small> "Pine Nut Land", {{IPA-pt|kuɾiˈtʃibɐ}}) is the capital and largest city of the [[States of Brazil|Brazilian state]] of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. The city's population numbered approximately 1,879,355 people {{As of|2015|lc=y}}, making it the [[List of cities in Brazil by population|eighth most populous city in the country]], and the largest in Brazil's [[South Region, Brazil|South Region]]. The Curitiba [[Metropolitan area]] comprises 26 [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba-parana.com/geografia-mapas/mapa-regiao-curitiba.htm |title=Mapa da Região Metropolitana de Curitiba&nbsp;– Paraná |publisher=Curitiba-parana.com |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref> with a total population of over 3.2&nbsp;million ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] estimate in 2010),<ref>[http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2010/populacao_por_municipio.shtm] {{Wayback|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2010/populacao_por_municipio.shtm|title=Primeiros resultados do Censo 2010|date=20110614165617|df=yes}}</ref> making it the seventh most populous in the country.

Curitiba is an important cultural, political, and economic centre in [[Latin America]].<ref>[http://www.rnestrangeiros.com.br/#!location/galleryPage Curitiba]</ref> The city sits on a [[plateau]] at {{convert|932|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. It is located {{convert|105|km|mi}} west of the seaport of [[Paranaguá]] and is served by the [[Afonso Pena International Airport|Afonso Pena International]] and [[Bacacheri Airport|Bacacheri]] airports. The city hosts the [[Federal University of Paraná]], established in 1912.

In the 1700s Curitiba possessed a favorable location between [[cattle]]-breeding country and marketplaces, leading to a successful cattle trade and the city's first major expansion. Later, between 1850 and 1950, it grew due to [[logging]] and agricultural expansion in the Paraná State (first [[Araucaria]] logging, later [[mate (beverage)|mate]] and [[coffee]] cultivation and in the 1970s wheat, corn and [[soybean]] cultivation). In the 1850s waves of [[European Brazilian|European immigrants]] arrived in Curitiba, mainly [[German Brazilian|Germans]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italians]], [[Polish Brazilian|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians of Brazil|Ukrainians]], contributing to the city's economic and cultural development.<ref name="curitiba-parana">{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba-parana.net/tradicoes.htm |title=Tradições Culturais|publisher=Curitiba-parana.net |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011|language=portuguese}}</ref> Nowadays, only smaller numbers of foreign immigrants arrive, primarily from [[Middle East]]ern<ref name="paimeas">{{cite web |title=A imigração árabe muçulmana em Curitiba |publisher=Etni-cidade |language=Portuguese |accessdate=3 October 2008 |url=http://www.etni-cidade.net/2008/a_imigracao_arabe.htm}}</ref> and other South American countries.

The biggest expansion occurred after the 1960s, with innovative [[urban planning]] that changed the population size from some hundreds of thousands to more than a million people.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dados do IBGE sobre Curitiba |publisher=IBGE |language=Portuguese |accessdate=31 July 2011 |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/painel/painel.php?codmun=410690#}}</ref> Curitiba's economy is based on industry and services and is the fourth largest in [[Economy of Brazil|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cidades Brasileiras, Curitiba |publisher=SuaPesquisa|language=Portuguese |accessdate=31 July 2011 |url=http://www.suapesquisa.com/cidadesbrasileiras/cidade_curitiba.htm}}</ref> Economic growth occurred in parallel to a substantial inward flow of Brazilians from other cities of the country, as approximately half of the city's population was not born in Curitiba.<ref name="estra">{{cite web |title=Quase metade de Curitiba é dos "estrangeiros" |publisher=Bem Paraná |language=Portuguese |accessdate=6 August 2008 |url=http://www.bemparana.com.br/index.php?n=23799&t=quase-metade-de-curitiba-e-dosestrangeiros}}</ref>

Curitiba was one of the host cities of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]], and again for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

==Name==
[[File:Curitiba Centro.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Batel and Água Verde neighbourhoods]]
One theory is that the name "Curitiba" comes from the [[Tupi language|Tupi]] words ''kurí tyba'', "many pine seeds" due to the large number of pinecones of [[Araucaria angustifolia|Paraná pines]] in the region prior to its founding.<ref name=autogenerated2>Fenianos, E. (2003) ''Almanaque Kur'yt'yba'', Curitiba: Univer Cidade, p.6</ref> Another version, also using words from the Tupi language, is that it originates in the combination of ''kurit'' (pine tree) and ''yba'' (large amount).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inf.ufpr.br/sibgrapi2004/site.html |title=Curitiba name origin |publisher=Inf.ufpr.br |date=20 October 2004 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref>

The Portuguese who founded a settlement on the site in 1693 named it "Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais" (Village of "Our Lady of the Light" of the Pines). The name was changed to "Curitiba" in 1721. Curitiba officially became a town in 1812, spelling its name as "Curityba." An alternative spelling was "Coritiba." This was used in press and state documents. A state decree in 1919 settled the dispute by adopting "Curitiba."<ref name=autogenerated2/>

===Government===
[[File:Palácio 29 de Março Curitiba Paraná Brasil.jpg|thumb|right|The Curitiba City Hall]]
{{As of|2013}} the mayor was Gustavo Fruet, who replaced Luciano Ducci. The [[City Council]] of Curitiba has 38 councillors elected since 2004. Curitiba is divided into nine regional governments (equivalent to [[subprefecture]]), who manage the municipality's 75 districts. The ''Rua da Cidadania'' ("Street of Citizenship") is the symbol of administrative decentralization; it is a reference point and a meeting place. Several units are annexed to public transport terminals. Their nuclei offer services in the local, [[States of Brazil|state]] and [[Federal republic|federal]] areas.<ref>[http://www.zoohara.com/travel-guide-curitiba-parana-state-vacations-government Government - Curitiba]</ref>

[[Jaime Lerner]] is perhaps Curitiba's best-known mayor. He has been mayor three times, the first time in the early 1970s. His leadership was crucial to some major changes in the city. Curitiba has built parks instead of canals to reduce flooding; used parks to make the city more liveable; pedestrianised the downtown area; invented and built Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a bus system that works like a light rail system but is 10 times cheaper; and started a massive recycling scheme that included giving people bus tokens in return for waste.<ref>[http://www.citiesforpeople.net/cities/curitiba.html A city for people, not for cars]</ref>

[[Time magazine]] listed this former [[mayor]] among the world's most influential thinkers of 2010. In the days before free, direct elections, mayors were political appointees who were no more than pawns in the game of power politics and were subject to replacement at any time. For an idealistic young architect like Lerner, retaining the mayor's office was particularly precarious. Those holding the reins of power at the time were under the mistaken impression that Lerner's youth would make him easy to control. As it turned out, he was no [[wikt:milquetoast|milquetoast]], and subsequently set about enthusiastically pursuing reform.<ref>[http://english.cw.com.tw/article.do?action=show&id=13718&offset=0 Former Curitiba Mayor Jaime Lerner]</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Curitiba}}
[[File:Mapa Curitiba 1894 CR493.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Curitiba in 1894 (Portuguese edition).]]
The first ten years of the 16th century had a war of conquest by [[European Brazilian|Europeans]] ([[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese colonists]]) against the [[Kaingang]] and [[Guaraní people|Guarani]] who inhabited the area of the city. Curitiba's birth is 29 March 1693, when its City Council was founded. At the end of the 17th century, Curitiba's agriculture was only for subsistence. Its main economic activities were mineral extraction.<ref name="curitiba.pr.gov.br">[http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/ingles/historia History of Curitiba]</ref> Waves of European immigrants arrived after 1850, mainly Poles, Italians, Germans (mostly from Russia) and Ukrainians.<ref name="curitiba-parana"/> In 1853, the south and southwest of the province of [[State of São Paulo|São Paulo]] were emancipated, forming the new province of Paraná with Curitiba as its capital.<ref name="triposo.com">[http://www.triposo.com/loc/Curitiba/history History of Curitiba]</ref>

The region's next economic cycle was based on the ''"tropeiros"'' ("troopers"): cattlemen who drove their herds from [[Viamão]], in the southernmost state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], to a market in [[Sorocaba]], in the state of [[State of São Paulo|São Paulo]]. From there, the herds were then taken to the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. The drovers would spend winter periods in the middle of the journey, in the ''"campos de Curitiba"'' (fields of Curitiba). These [[campsite]]s would be dismantled when the cold season gave way to spring. The drovers would take advantage of their stay to do business, and by doing so, they made Curitiba into an important intermediate trading post. The traditions of wearing wool ponchos, roasting meat and drinking a bitter mate tea called ''"[[chimarrão]]"'', encouraged a common culture that led people to form groups and settle.<ref name="curitiba.pr.gov.br"/> The cycle of cattle drives lasted for more than two centuries. With it, came many distinct cultural features of the Paraná region, especially the unique accent noticeable by pronounced Es.<ref name="curitiba.pr.gov.br"/>
[[File:Curitiba-view.jpg|thumb|right|Nossa Senhora da Luz Cathedral and Downtown Curitiba in 1900.]]
The expanded use of the [[yerba mate|mate]] plant and wood at the end of the 19th century stimulated the construction of the [[Paranaguá]]-Curitiba railroad. This railroad was the first link between the capital of Paraná and the coast. It was built in five years (from 1880 to 1885). This railroad represents one of the greatest works of national engineering, made possible thanks to the engineers and brothers Antonio and André Rebouças. Immigrant manual labor was heavily used. Immigrants had come to this area since the middle of the 18th century.<ref name="curitiba.pr.gov.br"/>

Around the beginning of the 20th century, Curitiba benefited from the wealth of the [[yerba mate]] mills. The owners (known as ''"Maté Barons"'') built [[mansion]]s in the capital. These have mostly been preserved in the districts of Batel and Alto da Glória.

The next economic cycle was the coffee monoculture. This trade helped found cities in the northern region of the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]]. Coffee was important the capital's economy.<ref name="curitiba.pr.gov.br"/> Coffee crops suffered from the relentless effects of bad weather. So, farmers gradually replaced coffee by [[soybean]]s. Mechanized soybean farming drove agricultural workers off of the land. Eventually, coffee was completely wiped out in the region's worst frost, known as the Black Frost of July, 1975.

During the 20th century, especially after 1950, the city's population rapidly increased. It consolidated its position as a regional hub for trade and services, becoming one of the richest cities in the Southern Cone and a pioneer in urban solutions.<ref name="triposo.com"/> In the 1940s and 1950s, [[Alfred Agache (architect)|Alfred Agache]], co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce its first [[city plan]]. It emphasized a "star" of [[boulevard]]s, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed in part, but the plan was too expensive to complete.<ref name="agac">{{cite web |title=The Agache Plan|publisher=Prefeitura Municipal de Curitiba|accessdate=12 August 2008 |url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/Paginas/ENG/Default.aspx?idf=532&servico=40}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

When Curitiba received great waves of immigrants, the city was forced to make swift decisions in order to avoid urban chaos and meet future demands. Curitiba invested in [[urban planning]] and in city management focused on its residents.

==Geography==

===Climate===
[[File:AmorMaternoJBCuritiba.JPG|thumb|Fog in the Botanical Garden.]]
Curitiba has a [[subtropical highland climate]] (a form of oceanic or maritime temperate climate) (''Cfb''), according to the [[Köppen classification]] and the Brazilian government classification. Located in [[Southern Brazil]], the humid city lies in a [[temperate zone]].<ref>[http://www.esisaocarlosborromeo.com.br/conteudo_detalhes.asp?cod_conteudo=151 Climate of Curitiba]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref> It is located on a plateau and the flat terrain with flooded areas contribute to its mild and damp winter, with an average minimum temperature of {{convert|7|C|F}} in the coldest month, occasionally falling below {{convert|0|C|F}} on the coldest nights. During summertime, the average temperature is around {{convert|25|C|F}} at daytime, but it can get above {{convert|30|C|F}} on the hottest days. Snowfall was experienced in 1889, 1892, 1912, 1928 (two days), 1942, 1955, 1957, 1962, 1975 and again in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=SYNOP: SUMMARIZED DATA FOR CURITIBA|url=http://www.mundomanz.com/meteo_p/byind?countr=BRASIL&ind=83840&year=2013&month=07&day=24&n_days=3&time=all&l=1&trans=PA&action=display|publisher=Mundomanz|accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=METAR: Weather History for Curitiba, Brazil|url=http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/SBCT/2013/7/23/DailyHistory.html?theprefset=SHOWMETAR&theprefvalue=1|publisher=Weather Underground|accessdate=25 July 2013}}</ref> Its altitude makes it the coldest among Brazil's state capitals.

The terrain's flatness hinders water drainage after rain, therefore providing water vapor for the atmosphere. Cold fronts come year round, often from [[Antarctica]] and Argentina, bringing tropical storms in summer and cold winds in the winter. They can move very quickly, with no more than one day between the start of the southern winds and the start of rain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bemparana.com.br/index.php?n=75493&t=frente-fria-traz-chuva-ao-parana-e-aumenta-taxas-de-umidade |title=Frente fria traz chuva ao Paraná e aumenta taxas de umidade |publisher=Bemparana.com.br |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011|language=Portuguese}}</ref> Curitiba's weather is also influenced by the dry air masses that dominate Brazil's midwest most of the year, bringing hot and dry weather, sometimes even in winter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.rpc.com.br/gazetadopovo/vidaecidadania/conteudo.phtml?tl=1&id=778839&tit=Inverno-vai-ser-mais-seco-e-mais-frio-que-o-do-ano-passado |title=Winter of Curitiba is dry and cold |publisher=Portal.rpc.com.br |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}} {{Dead link|date=March 2013}}</ref>

Curitiba is located in the area of the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (also known as [[Araucaria moist forests]]), a sub-type of the [[Atlantic Forest]]. In Curitiba it is possible to find steppes, forests and other formations. The local vegetation consists of remnants of the Paraná (or Brazilian) pine (''[[Araucaria angustifolia]]''), which resisted the efforts of settlers. The Paraná pines are in private and public areas and are protected from logging. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a [[botanical garden]] and three [[greenhouse]]s that produce 150,000 native and exotic seedlings: 16,000 fruit trees, 260,000 flowers, foliage and underbrush specimens and the maintenance of another 350,000 seedlings.<ref name="casecwb">{{cite web |title= City of Curitiba, Brazil|publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity |accessdate=23 May 2008 |url=http://www.cbd.int/authorities/casestudy/curitiba.shtml}}</ref>

Curitiba's green area itself matches the size of other large Brazilian cities. The vegetation of Curitiba encompasses a large population of purple and yellow ''ipês'' ([[tabebuia]]s), making a beautiful sight during flowering at winter's end. The yellow ipê is the city's most common tree.<ref name="arvct">{{cite web |title= Livro mostra roteiros das árvores de Curitiba/Pr|publisher=Ambiente Brasil |language=Portuguese|accessdate=25 May 2005 |url=http://www.ambientebrasil.com.br/noticias/index.php3?action=ler&id=18883}}</ref>

===Hydrography===
[[File:Rio iguaçu curitiba.jpg|thumb|Iguaçu River, running by the south region of the city.]]
The [[drainage basin|catchment area]] of Curitiba consists of rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the city's [[Drainage basin|watershed]] are: Atuba River, Belém River, Barigüi River, Passaúna River, Ribeirão dos Padilhas and the [[Iguaçu River]], all with characteristics of [[dendritic drainage]]. Curitiba has been working since the 1970s on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of [[wikt:urbanization|urbanization]] on rivers. An example is the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which absorb and retain water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods.<ref name="casecwb"/>
[[File:Curitiba vista serra do mar.jpg|thumb|left|The Mountain Range of the Sea, ''"Serra do Mar."'']]
After many studies of local water flows, most rivers were found to be subject to a [[Canalized|canalization]] process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the negative effects of urbanization are the implementation of programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works.<ref name="casecwb"/>

===Topography===
The city covers {{convert|432.17|km2|2|abbr=out}} on the First Plateau of Paraná. Curitiba has a [[topography]] of smooth, rounded hills, giving it a relatively regular shape. The city has an average altitude of {{convert|934.6|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The highest point is to the north at {{convert|1021|m|ft}}, and with lower altitudes at {{convert|864|m|ft}} to the south.

Mountain ranges and sets of [[rocky]] hills surround parts of the city, including the ''Serra do Mar'', a hill range between the shores and the First Plateau in Paraná.

As with most of [[Southern Brazil]]'s population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by European descendents. The first Europeans to arrive were of [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] origin, during the 17th century. They [[interracial marriage|intermarried]] with the [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|native people]] and with the African [[slave]]s.<ref name="pr">{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/pmc/curitiba/index.asp?noframe=sim&conteudo=imigra/index.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703141121/http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/pmc/curitiba/index.asp?noframe=sim&conteudo=imigra/index.html |archivedate=3 July 2007 |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=3 July 2007 |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>

Up until the 19th century, the inhabitants of the city of Curitiba were natives, mixed-raced, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants. Immigration became appealing as of 1808, when in a decree promulgated by the then Ruling Prince [[Dom João VI]], foreigners were granted the right to ownership of land. After [[Independence of Brazil]] in 1822, the country began to worry even more about its territory and the settlers on its lands. In Curitiba, this concern became even worse as of 1853, when Paraná, which belonged to the Judicial District of São Paulo, became an independent Province. During this period, European immigrants began arriving in hordes.<ref>[http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/ingles/historia The Curitibano]</ref>

The Memorial of Polish Immigration was inaugurated on 13 December 1980, after the visit of the [[Pope John Paul II]] in June. Its area is {{convert|46000|m2}} and was part of the former Candles plant. The seven wooden log houses are parts of this memorial area, as a souvenir of the Polish immigrants' struggles and faith. Objects like an old wagon, pipe of cabbage and a print of the [[Black Madonna of Częstochowa]] (patron saint of [[Polish people]]), form parts of the memorial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parques-curitiba.com/bosque-papa-joao-paulo.htm|title=Polish Memorial of Curitiba |publisher=Parques-curitiba.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref>

[[Japanese-Brazilian|Japanese]] immigrants began arriving in 1915, with a larger contingent arriving in 1924. Curitiba received a significant Japanese influx. They settled mostly between Paraná and São Paulo state. The city has the second largest Japanese community in Brazil, behind only São Paulo, according to IBGE. Although both cities have around the same proportion of Japanese descendants, other large cities in the countryside, such as Maringá and Londrina, have an even higher rate. Some estimates suggest that more than 40,000 Japanese-Brazilians living in the Curitiba.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba-parana.net/japao.htm |title=Japan Square in Curitiba |publisher=Curitiba-parana.net |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref>

Since 1990, the Municipal Housing Fund has provided financial support to housing for lower income populations. After national housing finance collapsed in 1985, just as people from the countryside poured into Curitiba, the city's [[public housing]] program bought one of the few remaining large plots of land, "Novo Bairro" (New Neighborhood), as home for 50,000 families. While landowners built the houses themselves, each received a pair of trees and an hour's consultation with an architect to help them develop their plan. COHAB also built Technology Street, an avenue of 24 homes in the centre of Novo Bairro, each built using different construction techniques.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hopebuilding.pbworks.com/Brazilian-city-of-Curitiba-may-be-most-livable-city-in-the-world |title=Housing Program Curitiba |publisher=Hopebuilding.pbworks.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref>

Libraries work with municipal schools, offering a collection of approximately 5000 books, and provide cultural reference and leisure.<ref name="ecofanit">{{cite web |title=CURITIBA, UNA CITTÀ DA FANTASCIENZA|publisher=Eco Fantascienza|language=Italian|accessdate=18 October 2008 |url=http://www.ecofantascienza.it/articoli/curitiba.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080501143512/http://www.ecofantascienza.it/articoli/curitiba.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 1 May 2008}}</ref>

==Urban planning==
[[File:Rua 24 horas 2 Curitiba Basil.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Entrance of [[Rua 24 Horas|24 Hours Street]].]]
Curitiba has a planned transportation system, which includes lanes on major streets devoted to a [[bus rapid transit]] system. The buses are split into three sections ([[Bi-articulated bus|bi-articulated]]) and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with access for disabled riders. Buses charge one price regardless of distance.<ref>Jonas Rabinovitch and Josef Leitman, "Urban Planning in Curitiba", ''Scientific American'', vol. 274, no. 3 (March 1996), pp. 46–53</ref>

The city preserves and cares for its green areas, boasting {{convert|51.5|m2|sqft}} of green space per inhabitant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/interna/0,,OI1926962-EI299,00.html|title=Curitiba busca recuperação de biodiversidade local Terra – Ambiente |publisher=Noticias.terra.com.br |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref>

In the 1940s and 1950s, [[Alfred Agache (architect)|Alfred Agache]], cofounder of the [[French Society for Urban Studies]], was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a star of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. The plan was too expensive to complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/Paginas/ENG/Default.aspx?idf=532&servico=40 |title=Prefeitura ENG |publisher=Curitiba.pr.gov.br |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

By the 1960s, Curitiba's population had reached 430,000. Some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to damage the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect [[Jaime Lerner]], who later became mayor, led a team from the [[Universidade Federal do Paraná]] that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, reduced traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector and a convenient and affordable public transit system.<ref>[http://www.mcachicago.org/massivechange/timelines/urban.pdf About Curitiba] {{Wayback|url=http://mcachicago.org/massivechange/timelines/urban.pdf|date=20101125170008|df=yes}}</ref>

This plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed [[Rua XV de Novembro|XV de Novembro St.]] to vehicles, because it had high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This used two one-way streets moving in opposite directions that surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have an exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges on the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density development, to pull traffic away from the main roads. In a number of areas subject to floods, buildings were condemned and the land became parks.<ref>[http://www.pescacommosca.com.br/noticia/lernoticia.php?IdtNoticia=869 Parks of Curitiba and floods]  {{wayback|url=http://www.pescacommosca.com.br/noticia/lernoticia.php?IdtNoticia=869 |date=20061012061522 |df=y }}</ref>

Today, Curitiba is considered one of the world's best examples of urban planning.<ref>Irazábal, Clara Elena (2002) ''Curitiba and Portland: Architecture, City Making, and Urban Governance in the Era of Globalization'', PhD Dissertation in Architecture, University of California, Berkeley, p.112</ref> In June 1996, the chairman of the [[Habitat II]] summit of mayors and urban planners in [[Istanbul]] praised Curitiba as "the most innovative city in the country."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-44782001000100007&script=sci_arttext |title=Curitiba – urban plannig |doi=10.1590/S0104-44782001000100007 |publisher=Scielo.br |date=31 March 1993 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref>
[[File:Rua xv curitiba.jpg|thumb|right|180px|15 November Street.]]
Curitiba was recently recommended by [[UNESCO]] as a model for the reconstruction of the cities of [[Afghanistan]].<ref name="afghjp">{{cite web |script-title=ja:クリチバもモデルに＝カブール復興計画に参加 |publisher=Nikkey Shimbun|language=Japanese |accessdate=21 October 2008 |url=http://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/020615-24brasil.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041103064150/http://www.nikkeyshimbun.com.br/020615-24brasil.html |archivedate=3 November 2004}}</ref> In the 1980s, the RIT ([[Rede Integrada de Transporte]], ''Integrated Transport Network'') was created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.urbs.curitiba.pr.gov.br/PORTAL/historiadotransportecoletivo.php |title=RIT Curitiba – Trajetory |publisher=Urbs.curitiba.pr.gov.br |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> At the same time, the city began building the "Faróis de Saber" (''Lighthouses of Knowledge'') educational centres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmc.pr.gov.br/ass_det.php?not=7004 |title=Social programs in the city |publisher=Cmc.pr.gov.br |date=16 May 2006 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> The city has more than {{convert|400|km2|0|abbr=out}} of public parks and forests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenplanetmonitor.net/news/2012/12/curitiba-sustainable-city/|title=Curitiba - Sustainable City|last=Anil Mundra|date=27 December 2012|publisher=Green Planet Monitor|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2007, the city placed third in a list of "15 Green Cities" in the world, according to "[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]" magazine, after [[Reykjavík]] in Iceland and [[Portland, Oregon]] in the United States. As a result, according to one survey, 99% of Curitibans are happy with their hometown.<ref name="grist">{{cite web |title=15 Green Cities|publisher=Grist|accessdate=10 July 2007 |url=http://www.grist.org/article/cities3}}</ref> The "green exchange" employment program focuses on social inclusion, benefiting both those in need and the environment. Low-income families living in shantytowns unreachable by truck bring their trash bags to neighborhood centres, where they exchange them for bus tickets and food. This means less city litter and less disease, less garbage in sensitive areas such as rivers and a better life for the undernourished poor. There's also a program for children where they can exchange [[recyclable]] garbage for school supplies, chocolate, toys and tickets for shows.

Jaime Lerner suggests [[Urban Acupuncture|urban acupuncture]] as the future solution for contemporary urban issues; focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities, can create positive ripple effects. Urban "acupuncture" reclaims land for the public and emphasizes the importance of community development through small interventions in design of cities.<ref>[http://forum.davidson.edu/anthro16/space/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] - '' Understanding Space'' 2011</ref> It emphasises pinpoint interventions that can be accomplished quickly to create a make an immediate impact.<ref>[http://www.brazilmax.com/news.cfm/tborigem/pl_south/id/10 Curitiba: Jaime Lerner’s Urban Acupuncture] - ''Bill Hinchberger, Brazilmax'' 2/2006</ref>
He stated:

''I believe that some medicinal "magic" can and should be applied to cities, as many are sick and some nearly terminal. As with the medicine needed in the interaction between doctor and patient, in urban planning it is also necessary to make the city react; to poke an area in such a way that it is able to help heal, improve, and create positive chain reactions. It is indispensable in revitalizing interventions to make the organism work in a different way.''<ref>[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ "Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] - Kyle Miller" MSIS 9/2011</ref>

Under the "Garbage? That's not garbage!" program, 70% of the city's trash is recycled by its residents. Once a week, a truck collects paper, [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]], metal, plastic and glass that has been sorted by residents. The city's paper [[recycling]] saves the equivalent of 1,200 trees a day. Money raised from selling materials goes into social programs and the city employs the homeless and alcoholics in its garbage separation plant.

Open University, created by the city, lets residents take courses in many subjects such as mechanics, hair styling and environmental protection for a small fee. Retired city buses are often used as mobile schools or offices. Downtown areas were transformed into [[pedestrian street]]s, including a 24-hour mall (the [[Rua 24 Horas]]) with shops, restaurants and cafes, and a street of flowers with gardens tended by street kids.

The "capacity building job line" was created to accelerate economic development. Key initiatives include the South-Circular bus line, which links the southern and eastern regions of town; Entrepreneurial "Sheds", business incubators designed to help small companies get established and prosper; and the Crafts Lycée, which trains people for [[profession]]s such as marketing and finance. Specifically, the goal is to provide jobs and income for the unemployed among 400,000 people living in 15 peripheral towns, and to structure and develop the region according to integrated planning principles. About 15,000 new jobs were generated by 2013.<ref>[http://www3.iclei.org/localstrategies/summary/curitiba2.html Curitiba a green city]</ref>

The transit service is used by more than 2&nbsp;million people a day. Curitiba has more car owners per capita than anywhere else in Brazil. The population has doubled since 1974, yet auto traffic declined by 30%, and [[atmospheric pollution]] is the lowest in Brazil.<ref>[http://www3.iclei.org/localstrategies/summary/curitiba2.html Curitiba – low pollution]</ref>

Recent policies, that allow beggars and hobos to set permanent camp in its squares and public places, have led the quality of life in Curitiba to deteriorate, as some of these invasions, normally overlooked by the municipal authorities, pose a threat to public health, in addition to being an eyesore, thus giving Curitiba distinctive characteristics of an underdeveloped urban centre.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Culture==
[[File:Curitiba - Feira do Largo da Ordem - Grupo de Chorinho.JPG|thumb|left|Musicians in [[Feirinha do largo da ordem]].]]
Culture has always held a crucial role in the development of the city of Curitiba and that granted the city nationwide attention, during the 1970s. With the inauguration of the Teatro Paiol, a deactivated warehouse formerly used for stocking army ammunition, many different [[artist]]s came to perform in its [[arena]], ranging from local artists of various genres. In January 1973, the Fundação Cultural de Curitiba was officially set up, with the aim of promoting [[culture]] and of acting as a facilitating agent in the cultural production of the city.<ref name="pr2">[http://www.curitiba.pr.gov.br/idioma/ingles/historia Culture of Curitiba]</ref>

The Fundação Cultural de Curitiba currently has a broad infrastructure, made up of a specialized staff, 150 sites for cultural events in 50 different buildings throughout the city. Culture pervades all of the city's districts, through the set up of cultural centres, [[Library|libraries]], museums, [[movie theater]]s, theaters, exhibit rooms, and [[studio]]s, all equipped to meet the needs of the artists and of the community that these cultural spaces attend.<ref name="pr2"/>

The [[Foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]] is also responsible for the preservation, conservation and research of the [[cultural heritage]] of Curitiba. Its headquarters are located in a building registered and protected as part of the State's Historical Patrimony, the Palacete Wolf (Wolf Mansion), built in 1877, in the Largo da Ordem, a Historical Area of Curitiba. In the Foundation's courtyard, there is the Piá Theater (piá being a local term used to refer to youngsters). This theater was inaugurated in 1973 and is the first public space in the country for puppet and [[marionette]] shows.<ref name="pr2"/>
[[File:Teatro Paiol 01 Curitiba Brasil.jpg|thumb|right|External view of Paiol Theatre.]]
The Historical Sector is another innovation brought by the new policies regarding culture in the city. In the 1970s, when people were still talking about preserving individual buildings, Curitiba passed a [[Law of Brazil|law]] to preserve the city's entire historical sector, an innovative policy which later was adopted throughout the entire country. The cultural spaces that Curitiba boasts are tourist attractions in themselves. The Parque das Pedreiras (Quarries Park), for example, includes an area that was once a stone quarry and has now been named the Pedreira Paulo Leminski, as well as a theater called the Ópera de Arame (an opera house built entirely of metallic structures and glass), that can accommodate audiences of 30,000 people. [[Performer]]s that have been on its stage include names such as the Spanish tenor José Carreras, stars from the Brazilian Popular Music movement, Paul McCartney and others.<ref name="pr2"/>

The Guaíra Theater, maintained by the state government, is one of the largest theaters in all of South America. The [[Oscar Niemeyer]] Museum is one of the most impressive projects created and carried out by one of Brazil's architecture masterminds, Oscar Niemeyer. The Frans Krajcberg Cultural Space lies in the Botanical Gardens, one of the city's most famous parks. This space holds 114 large-scale sculptures and three carvings in relief made out of trunks of trees, these works are in the process of being donated to the city. It is the first place in the world that was specifically designed to house the works of this Polish.<ref name="pr2"/>
[[File:Opera de Arame Interior.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wire Opera House]].]]
The Cultural Complex Solar do Barão, located in Downtown Curitiba, features the Photography Museum, the Engravings Museum and the Posters Museu. There is also a space called ''"Gibiteca"'', a comic books library. The Gibiteca, inaugurated in 1982, is a national pioneer and holds exhibits, comic strips contests, fairs and workshops. It has more than 10,000 members and around 45,000 books.
The MuMA - Museu Metropolitano de Arte (Museum of Metropolitan Art) displays its permanent collection of artists from the state of Paraná as well as renowned Brazilian [[painter]]s such as Pancetti, Guignard, [[Di Cavalcanti]], Djanira, [[Cândido Portinari|Portinari]], Mário Cravo, [[Burle Marx]].<ref name="pr2"/>

When it comes to music, the [[Brazilian Popular Music]] Conservatory deserves all the attention. The institution maintains wind and string orchestras, not to mention the Brasileirão and the Brasileirinho choirs. The city also proudly maintains the renowned Curitiba's Camerata Antiqua, which is the most important ensemble in Brazil when it comes to musica antiqua. The Fundação Cultural de Curitiba has been hosting the largest music workshop in South America every year since 1982. It lasts 20 days and around 2,000 students take part in its activities, while a total public of 21,000 people attend the more than 100 concerts.<ref name="pr2"/>

Several cultural events also take place at Curitiba's parks, paying tribute to its various [[ethnic group]]s that have settled in the region since the 19th century. At the Tingüi Park you will find the Ukrainian Memorial. The architectural complex includes a portal and a replica of the old Saint Michael chapel, built at the top of the Serra do Tigre mountain range. The chapel is adorned with a golden dome and is made of wood, in a typical [[Byzantine style]]. Visitors will always find a permanent exhibit of the famous pysanky ([[Ukrainian culture|Ukrainian]] decorated [[Easter egg]]s), religious icons and embroidered items.<ref name="pr2"/>

The Polish Immigrants Memorial, also known as The Pope's Woods, offers an enjoyable area surrounded by trees, which makes it a perfect choice for a stroll. The Pope himself blessed the first [[replica]] of the traditional Polish houses that beautifully make up the Bosque do Papa when he visited the city in 1980.

So, that's the way culture spans Curitiba, with sites that have become part of the population's heritage and have in fact transformed themselves into part of the city's cultural legacy. In 2003, Curitiba received the "[[American Capital of Culture]]" title, granted by the OAS ([[Organization of American States]]).<ref name="pr2"/>

===Arts and entertainment===
Curitiba was Brazil's first city to have an [[IMAX]] movie theatre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shoppingpalladium.com.br/ |title=Palladium Shopping Center |publisher=Shoppingpalladium.com.br |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> Curitiba has many theaters.

===Museums===
Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] designed the extravagant state museum of Curitiba. Its design includes a gravity-defying construction that was intended to look like a [[Araucaria angustifolia|Paraná Pine]], one of the city's symbols, but is widely interpreted by locals as an eye, which gave the Museum its nickname – ''Museu do Olho'', or Museum of the Eye. In keeping with Curitiba's history and culture of science, the museum offers many science exhibitions, including biennial exhibitions. The Curitiba museum includes the Oscar Niemeyer auditorium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba.info/curitiba-history.html |title=Museums in the city |publisher=Curitiba.info |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Bus Stops 2 curitiba brasil.jpg|thumb|''Estação Tubo Praça Ozório'', one of the [[Estação Tubo|tube-shaped bus stops in Curitiba]].]]

===Public transport===
{{Main|Rede Integrada de Transporte}}
Curitiba's public transportation consists entirely of buses. It opened the world's first [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system, [[Rede Integrada de Transporte]], in 1974.<ref>{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Keith|title=Putting BRT in Car City, China|url=http://americancity.org/daily/entry/putting-brt-in-car-city-china|newspaper=Next American City|date=23 October 2012}}</ref> The popularity of Curitiba's BRT has effected a [[modal shift]] from automobile travel to bus travel. Based on 1991 traveler survey results, it was estimated that the introduction of the BRT had caused a reduction of about 27&nbsp;million auto trips per year, annually saving about 27&nbsp;million liters of fuel. In particular, 28 percent of BRT riders previously traveled by car. Compared to eight other Brazilian cities of its size, Curitiba uses about 30 percent less fuel per capita, resulting in one of the country's lowest rates of ambient air pollution. Some 1,100 buses make 12,500 trips every day, serving more than 1.3&nbsp;million passengers, 50 times the number from 20 years ago. Eighty percent of travelers use the express or direct bus services. Curitibanos spend only about 10 percent of their income on travel, much below the national average.<ref>{{cite web|last=Goodman |first=Joseph |url=http://www.urbanhabitat.org/node/344 |title=Urban transport of Curitiba |publisher=Urbanhabitat.org |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref>

The city government has been planning to introduce an [[metro (rapid transit)|underground metro]] for a number of years and in 2014 announced opened tenders for a 35-year [[public private partnership]] contract to build and operate a 17.6&nbsp;km, 14 station north-south line. The cost is estimated at 4.62&nbsp;billion reals.<ref>{{cite web|title= Curitiba re-launches metro concession tender|url=http://www.globalmasstransit.net/archive.php?id=16722|date=July 8, 2014}}</ref>

===Roads===
Moving around in a car can be difficult in and around the city centre because of the many one-way streets and frequent traffic jams. The Trinary Road System allows quick access to the city centre for drivers. Some avenues are spacious and laid out in a grid. Apart from some points around the city centre, Munhoz da Rocha Street and Batel Avenue, traffic jams are not severe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hagah.com.br/mapas |title=Roads in Curitiba |publisher=Hagah.com.br |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref>

===Air===
[[File:afonsopenaairport.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of [[Afonso Pena International Airport]].]]
[[Afonso Pena International Airport]] is Curitiba's main airport. It is located in the nearby city of [[São José dos Pinhais]]. All commercial flights operate from this airport.<ref>[http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=221 Afonso Pena International Airport] {{Wayback|url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/usa/aero_prev_home.php?ai=221|date=20081020001130|df=yes}}</ref>

There is also the [[Bacacheri Airport]], a smaller general aviation facility.

===Others===
The city has {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} of bike routes, used by around 30&nbsp;thousand bikers daily. City streets carry almost one million vehicles, of which 2,253 are orange Taxis. To service these vehicles, more than 355 petrol stations serve the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilprimedesign.com/eng/lernoticia.asp?cod=56 |title=Curitiba |publisher=Brasilprimedesign.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110708091133/http://www.brasilprimedesign.com/eng/lernoticia.asp?cod=56 |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>

==Sports==
{{Main|2014 FIFA World Cup|Sports in Brazil}}
[[File:Arenadabaixada2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arena da Baixada]].]]
Several association football teams play in Curitiba, [[Coritiba Foot Ball Club|Coritiba]] plays at [[Estádio Major Antônio Couto Pereira]], [[Clube Atlético Paranaense]] at [[Arena da Baixada|Estádio Joaquim Américo Guimarães]]. Both Coritiba and Atlético Paranaense have won [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]], in 1985 and 2001, respectively. Estádio Joaquim Américo Guimarães was one of the 12 stadiums to host games of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] held in Brazil. The stadium [[Vila Capanema]] have hosted the [[1950 FIFA World Cup]] which still is home to Paraná Clube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curitiba2014.com |title=Curitiba &#124; FIFA World Cup 2014 |publisher=Curitiba2014.com |date= |accessdate=22 July 2009}}</ref>
Clube Atlético Paranaense (Brazilian champion of 2001, several times champion of the state of Paraná). Arena da Baixada is one of the three privately owned stadiums of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The other two are [[Beira-Rio]] stadium, in [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Arena Itaquera]], in [[São Paulo]]. Arena da Baixada is considered one of the most modern stadiums in Brazil (it was the first to offer free [[Wi-Fi]], and one of the few with a central surveillance system). This is the lowest budget of all venues of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and again it has to do with the fact that the stadium is privately owned. Most of the original stadium was preserved, and just an expansion is planned; today's capacity is 25,000, which should be increasead to about 42,000.<ref name="aboutcuritiba.com">[http://www.aboutcuritiba.com/worldcup/stadium/ Arena da Baixada - Curitiba]</ref>

The [[Autódromo Internacional de Curitiba]] (Curitiba International Raceway) is located in nearby [[Pinhais]].

Curitiba has also one of the main [[rugby union]] clubs in Brazil, [[Curitiba Rugby Clube]], national champions in 2014.

==Neighborhoods==
[[File:Divisao administrativa Curitiba.svg|thumb|180px|Map of Curitiba, with the neighbourhoods and boroughs.]]
''Bairros'' (neighbourhoods) of Curitiba define the city's geographical divisions. Administrative powers are not delegated to neighborhoods, although neighborhood associations work to improve their communities.
Curitiba is divided into 9 regional governments (boroughs) covering the 75 neighbourhoods.
