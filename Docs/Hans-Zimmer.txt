==Early life==
Zimmer was born in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], Germany. As a young child, he lived in [[Königstein im Taunus|Königstein-Falkenstein]], where he played the piano at home, but had piano lessons only briefly as he disliked the discipline of formal lessons.<ref name="mtv.de">{{cite web

==Career==

===Early career===
Zimmer began his career playing keyboards and synthesizers in the 1970s, with the band Krakatoa.<ref>[https://www.myspace.com/krakatoa1975/photos/3604500 Krakatoa at Myspace Music]. Zimmer is second from right. Retrieved 2012-09-18.</ref> He worked with [[The Buggles]], a [[New wave music|new wave]] band formed in London in 1977 with [[Trevor Horn]], [[Geoff Downes]], and [[Bruce Woolley]]. Zimmer can be seen briefly in The Buggles' music video for the 1979 song "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]".<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.debidoss.co.uk/profile.swf
| title = DebiDoss |accessdate = 2009-09-11}}</ref> After working with The Buggles, he started to work for the Italian group [[Krisma]], a [[New wave music|new wave]] band formed in 1976 with [[Maurizio Arcieri]] and Christina Moser.  He was a featured synthesist for Krisma’s third album, ''Cathode Mamma''. He has also worked with the band [[Helden (band)|Helden]] (with [[Warren Cann]] from [[Ultravox]]).<ref name="Hans Zimmer biography"/> Both Zimmer (on keyboards) and Cann (on drums), were invited to be part of the Spanish group [[Mecano]] for a live performance in Segovia (Spain) in 1984. Two songs from this concert were included in the "[[Mecano: En Concierto]]" album released in 1985 only in Spain. In 1980 Zimmer co-produced a single, "[[The History of the World (Part 1)|History of the World, Part 1]]," with, and for, UK Punk band [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], which was also included on their 1980 LP release, "[[The Black Album (The Damned album)|The Black Album]]," and carried the description of his efforts as "Over-Produced by Hans Zimmer."

While living in London, Zimmer wrote advertising jingles for Air-Edel Associates.<ref name="Hans Zimmer biography">{{cite web |url = http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Zimmer,_Hans/Biography/ 
| title = Hans Zimmer biography  |publisher = Starpulse.com  |accessdate = 2009-06-10}}</ref> In the 1980s, Zimmer partnered with [[Stanley Myers]], a prolific film composer who wrote the scores for over sixty films. Zimmer and Myers co–founded the London–based Lillie Yard recording studio. Together, Myers and Zimmer worked on fusing the traditional orchestral sound with electronic instruments.<ref name="Biography: Hans Zimmer">{{cite web

Zimmer's first solo score was ''[[Terminal Exposure]]'' for director [[Nico Mastorakis]] in 1987, for which he also wrote the songs. Zimmer acted as score producer for the 1987 film ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Music (Scoring)|Academy Award for Best Original Score]].<ref name="Hans Zimmer biography"/>

One of Zimmer's most durable works from his time in the United Kingdom was the theme song for the television game show ''[[Going for Gold]]'', which he composed with Sandy McClelland in 1987. In an interview with the [[BBC]], Zimmer said: "''Going For Gold'' was a lot of fun. It's the sort of stuff you do when you don't have a career yet. God, I just felt so lucky because this thing paid my rent for the longest time."<ref name="Gold">{{cite news

===Hollywood film scoring===
A turning point in Zimmer's career occurred with the 1988 film ''[[Rain Man]]''.<ref name="Biography: Hans Zimmer"/> [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] director [[Barry Levinson]] was looking for someone to score ''Rain Man'', and his wife heard the soundtrack CD of the anti-[[Apartheid]] drama ''[[A World Apart (film)|A World Apart]]'', for which Zimmer had composed the music. Levinson was impressed by Zimmer's work, and hired him to score ''Rain Man''.<ref name="rain">{{cite news

Zimmer explained that "It was a [[road movie]], and road movies usually have jangly guitars or a bunch of strings. I kept thinking don't be bigger than the characters. Try to keep it contained. The Raymond character doesn't actually know where he is. The world is so different to him. He might as well be on Mars. So, why don't we just invent our own world music for a world that doesn't really exist?".<ref name="ew.com">{{cite news

A year after ''Rain Man'', Zimmer was asked to compose the score for [[Bruce Beresford]]'s ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' which, like ''Rain Man'', won an [[Academy Award]] for Best Picture. ''Driving Miss Daisy''’s instrumentation consisted entirely of synthesizers and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]]s, played by Zimmer. According to an interview with ''[[Sound On Sound]]'' magazine in 2002, the piano sounds heard within the score come from the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] MKS–20, a rackmount synthesizer. Zimmer joked: "It didn't sound anything like a piano, but it behaved like a piano."<ref name="sos">{{cite web

The soundtrack to [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1991 film ''[[Thelma & Louise]]'' by Zimmer featured the trademark [[slide guitar]] performance by [[Pete Haycock]] on the "Thunderbird" theme in the film. As a teenager, Zimmer was a fan of Haycock, and their collaboration on film scores includes ''[[K2 (film)|K2]]'' and ''[[Drop Zone (film)|Drop Zone]]''.<ref name="haycock">{{cite news

For the 1992 film ''[[The Power of One (film)|The Power of One]]'', Zimmer traveled to Africa in order to use African choirs and drums in the recording of the score. On the strength of this work,  [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] approached Zimmer to compose the score for the 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]''. This was to be his first score for an animated film. Zimmer said that he had wanted to go to South Africa to record parts of the soundtrack, but was unable to visit the country as he had a police record there "for doing 'subversive' movies" after his work on ''The Power of One''. Disney studio bosses expressed fears that Zimmer would be killed if he went to South Africa, so the recording of the choirs was organized during a visit by [[Lebo M]].<ref name="lion">{{cite news

Zimmer's score for [[Tony Scott]]'s 1995 film ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'' won a Grammy Award for the main theme, which makes heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments. For ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'' (1998), Zimmer said that the director [[Terrence Malick]] wanted the music before he started filming, so he recorded six and a half hours of music.<ref name="ew.com"/>  Zimmer's next project was ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (1998), which was produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. He introduced [[Ofra Haza]], an Israeli Yemenite singer, to the directors, and they thought she was so beautiful that they designed one of the characters in the film to look like her.<ref name="ew.com"/>

===2000s===
In the 2000s, Zimmer has composed scores for Hollywood blockbuster films including three Ridley Scott films, ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' (2000), ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' and ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001), followed by ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' (2003), ''[[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]]'' (2005), ''[[The Da Vinci Code (film)|The Da Vinci Code]]'' (2006), ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'' (2007),  ''[[Angels & Demons (film)|Angels & Demons]]'' (2009) and ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' (2009). While writing the score for ''The Last Samurai'', Zimmer felt that his knowledge of [[Music of Japan|Japanese music]] was extremely limited. He began doing extensive research, but the more he studied, the less he felt he knew. Finally, Zimmer took what he had written to Japan for feedback and was shocked when he was asked how he knew so much about Japanese music.<ref name="ew.com"/>

[[File:Hans Zimmer crop.jpg|thumb|Hans Zimmer at ''The Dark Knight'' premiere in 2008]]
During the scoring of ''The Last Samurai'' in early 2003, Zimmer was approached by the producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], with whom he had worked previously on ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'', ''[[Days of Thunder]]'', ''[[The Rock (film)|The Rock]]'' and ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]''. Bruckheimer had finished shooting ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' but was unhappy with the music composed for the film by [[Alan Silvestri]] and wanted a replacement score.<ref name="bruckheimer">{{cite web

<blockquote>"Originally I had this idea that it should be possible to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had "score by Hans Zimmer" and took sole credit on these things. It's like Gladiator: I gave [[Lisa Gerrard]] the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential.
