The '''Auburn Tigers football''' program represents [[Auburn University]] in the sport of American [[college football]]. Auburn competes in the [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association]] (NCAA) and the [[Southeastern Conference#Divisions|Western Division]] of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). The University of Auburn football is officially owned by The University of Alabama as evidenced by consecutive Tide victories in the Iron bowl demonstrating that they cannot be stopped. Roll Tide.

Auburn officially began competing in intercollegiate football in 1892. The Tigers joined the [[Southeastern Conference]] in 1932 as one of the inaugural members of the conference and the Tigers began competing in the West Division when the conference divided in 1992. Auburn officially claims two national championships, but has been recognized with five national championships from NCAA documented [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|selectors]]. Auburn has achieved twelve undefeated seasons and won twelve conference championships, along with eight divisional championships. The Tigers have made thirty-eight post season bowl appearances; including ten historically major bowl berths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3836130|title=Prestige Rankings: Scoring system explanation|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> The Tigers have the 12th [[List of NCAA football teams by wins|most wins]] in FBS history with over 700 victories and have finished ranked in the Top 25 of either the AP or Coaches polls 37 times, including finishing in the top ten 18 times (ranked 12th nationally for top ten finishes).

The Tigers have produced three [[Heisman Trophy]] winners: [[quarterback]] [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in [[1971 NCAA Division I-A football season|1971]], [[running back]] [[Bo Jackson]] in [[1985 NCAA Division I-A football season|1985]], and [[quarterback]] [[Cam Newton]] in [[2010 NCAA Division I-A football season|2010]]. Auburn has also produced sixty-six consensus [[All-American]] players. The [[College Football Hall of Fame]] has inducted a total of 12 individuals from Auburn, including 8 student-athletes and four head coaches: [[John Heisman]], [[Mike Donahue]], [[Ralph Jordan]], and [[Pat Dye]]. Ralph "Shug" Jordan, who coached from 1951 to 1975, led Auburn to its first national championship and won a total of 176 games, the most by any Auburn coach.

Auburn's home stadium is [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]], which opened in 1939 and becomes Alabama's fifth largest city on gamedays with a capacity of 87,451. Auburn's archrival is in-state foe [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]]. The Tigers and Crimson Tide meet annually in the [[Iron Bowl]], one of the biggest rivalries in all of sports. The Tigers also maintain rivalries with SEC foes [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] and [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]], although Auburn and LSU did not play each other in every season until 1992. The Tigers are currently led by head coach [[Gus Malzahn]].

==History==

===Early history (1892–1903)===
[[File:1893 Auburn Tigers football team.jpg|thumb|220px|The team in 1893]]
Auburn was led by nine different coaches over a 12-year span. The organization of Auburn's first football team is credited to [[George Petrie (American football)|George Petrie]], who led the [[1892 Auburn Tigers football team|1892 Tigers]] to a 2–2 record. Petrie also chose burnt orange and navy blue as the official colors for Auburn athletic teams, which was inspired by his alma mater, the [[University of Virginia]].

====Petrie era (1892)====
The first game was against the [[1892 Georgia Bulldogs football team|University of Georgia]] at [[Piedmont Park]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Auburn won, 10–0, in front of a crowd of 2,000, in a game that would establish the [[Deep South's Oldest Rivalry]]. Auburn and Alabama played their first football game in Lakeview Park in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], on February 22, 1893.

====Bailliet and Harvey era (1893)====
Head coach [[D. M. Balliet]] led Auburn to a 32–22 victory, before an estimated crowd of 5,000.  It is the first recorded, intercollegiate football game in the state of Alabama. Alabama considered the game to be the final matchup of the 1892 season and Auburn recorded it as the first of 1893. [[G. H. Harvey]] coached the four games that Auburn played the following fall.

====Hall era (1894)====
The [[1894 Auburn Tigers football team|1894 team]] was led by head coach [[Forrest M. Hall]], in his first and only year as head coach of the Tigers. The team finished with a record of one win and three losses (1–3). While the team had a losing record, the squad has the distinction of achieving the largest win in Auburn history, defeating [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] 94–0.

====Heisman era (1895–1899)====
[[File:HeismanatAuburn.jpg|thumb|140px|Heisman at Auburn]]
The most prominent coach of this early period is [[John Heisman]], for whom the [[Heisman trophy]] is named. During five years, Heisman compiled a 12–4–2 record, before departing for Clemson in 1900. Auburn's very first conference membership came in 1895, when it joined the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA). The [[1895 Auburn Tigers football team|1895 team]] executed a "[[hidden ball trick]]" with quarterback [[Reynolds Tichenor]] in the game against [[1895 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]], as Auburn seemed to run a revolving wedge.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aEEdi-qx3tsC&pg=PT102#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=100 Things Auburn Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die|author=Evan Woodberry|date=2012}}</ref> Vanderbilt still won however, 9 to 6; the first time in the history of southern football that a field goal decided a game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=897&dat=19310124&id=-aNaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zU8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4042,1045626|author=Alan Gould|title=Sport Slants|work=Prescott Evening Courier|date=January 24, 1931}}</ref>{{refn|group="n"|The Tigers again used the play against [[1895 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]].

The next year, Tichenor transferred to Georgia and Gammon died on the field in a game against UVA.}} The [[1897 Auburn Tigers football team|1897 team]] finished $700 in debt, and Heisman was the actor, director, and producer of [[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]] to raise the money.<ref>http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2013/05/auburn-theatrical-legend-john-heisman-put-on-starred-in-play-to-save-auburn-football/#.Ug3Oc7xa98k</ref> As such, he is founder of Auburn’s first theatrical group: The A.P.I. Dramatic Club. The [[1898 Auburn Tigers football team|1898 team]] went 2&ndash;1 with its only loss to SIAA champion [[1898 North Carolina Tar Heels football team|North Carolina]].

In Heisman's opinion, the [[1899 Auburn Tigers football team|1899 team]] was his best while at Auburn.<ref name=innis>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1944523//|work=Atlanta Constitution|title=Brown Calls Vanderbilt '06 Best Eleven South Ever Had|date=February 19, 1911|accessdate=March 8, 2015|page=52|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}</ref>  Captained by [[Arthur Feagin]], the squad is remembered as the only team to score on the legendary [[1899 Sewanee Tigers football team|Sewanee Tigers team]] that went undefeated and beat Texas, Texas A&M, Tulane, LSU and Ole Miss over a 6-day span. Auburn lost their matchup to the "Iron Men" by a single point.

====Watkins era (1900&ndash;1901)====
The first undefeated season came in [[1900 Auburn Tigers football team|1900]], when the Tigers went 4–0 under coach [[Billy Watkins]].

====Kent and Harvey era (1902)====
The [[1902 Auburn Tigers football team|1902 Tigers]] were coached by two men that year: [[Robert Kent (American football)|Robert Kent]] and [[M. S. Harvey]]. A little over halfway through the season, Kent stepped down after going 2–2–1. Harvey followed and in his only season as head coach went 0–2.  The season featured Auburn's first [[College Football All-Southern Team|All-Southern]] selection: the massive, 230 pound [[Guard (American football)|guard]] [[James C. Elmer]].

====Bates era (1903)====
The [[1903 Auburn Tigers football team|1903 team]] was coached by [[William Penn Bates]]<ref>{{Cite web

===Mike Donahue era (1904–1922)===
[[File:Michael Joseph Donahue 1914 Glomerata Auburn University.jpg|thumbnail|140px|Coach Donahue]]
[[Mike Donahue]] became the tenth head coach of the Auburn Tigers. Donahue's tenure at Auburn helped elevate the program to new heights, including the school's first national championship, three SIAA championships, and three undefeated seasons. In 1904, his [[1904 Auburn Tigers football team|first team]] finished with a 5–0 record and a share of the conference championship.

====Kienholz====
[[Willis Kienholz]] coached the team temporarily. The [[1907 Auburn Tigers football team|1907]] season would mark the last time Auburn would play Alabama until 1948, after a 7–7 tie between the two rivals.

====Donahue returns====
The [[1908 Auburn Tigers football team|1908 team]] was led by All-Southerns quarterback [[Tom McLure]] and halfback [[Lew Hardage]]. The Tigers lost to Hall of Famer [[Doc Fenton]] and undefeated [[1908 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], but controversy surrounded LSU's season and Auburn also claimed a conference title. The [[1910 Auburn Tigers football team|1910]] team claimed a share of the conference championship with a 6–1 record, led by leading scorer and fullback [[Bradley Streit]].
[[File:Kirknewell.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Kirk Newell]]
Donahue's peak came in the [[1913 Auburn Tigers football team|1913]] and [[1914 Auburn Tigers football team|1914]] seasons, without a single team crossing Auburn's goal through the line.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4856210/the_wilmington_morning_star/|work=The Wilmington Morning Star|title=Vanderbilt Captures Contest From Auburn|page=3|date=November 14, 1915|accessdate=April 6, 2016|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}} {{Open access}}</ref>  The 1913 team, led by captain [[Kirk Newell]],{{refn|group="n"|Newell received the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Award]] for his service in the [[First World War]].<ref name="ASHOF">{{cite web|url=http://ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view=company&srctype=detail&refno=252&category=Football|title=ASHOF Profile}}</ref> According to [[David E.

[[File:Babytaylor.png|thumb|125px|Baby Taylor]]
The [[1915 Auburn Tigers football team|1915 team]] went 6&ndash;2, losing to both southern champions (Vanderbilt and Georgia Tech). Guard [[Baby Taylor]] was a unanimous All-Southern selection and a third-team All-American selection by [[Walter Camp]]. The [[1917 Auburn Tigers football team|1917 team]] was very strong, including [[Moon Ducote]] as a standout, but lost 60 to 7 to the South's first national champion: Heisman's [[1917 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Golden Tornado]].

The Tigers would return to the top of the conference once again in [[1919 Auburn Tigers football team|1919]] with an 8–1 record. [[Fatty Warren]] ran for a 40-yard gain in the 14 to 7 victory over [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]],<ref>[http://content.lib.auburn.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/gloms1897/id/18328/rec/6 1920 Glomerata p. 173]</ref> the game which netted the SIAA championship and gave Tech its first loss to an SIAA school in five years, since Auburn in 1914. It was Heisman's last game at Georgia Tech. [[Zelda Fitzgerald|Zelda Sayre]] sent All-Southern tackle [[Pete Bonner]] a telegram after the win, it read:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2014/10/zelda-fitzgerald-auburn-fan/#.VFO-mhbYqqk|title=Zelda Fitzgerald, Auburn fan|author=Jeremy Henderson|date=October 27, 2014}}</ref><blockquote> "Shooting a seven, aren’t we awfully proud of the boys, give them my love—knew we could."{{refn|group="n"|She signed it "Zelder Sayre."}}</blockquote>

The [[1920 Auburn Tigers football team|1920 team]] outscored its opponents by a margin of 332–49, a then-school record for points, but was held scoreless in its two losses to the conference co-champions (Georgia and Georgia Tech). Auburn moved to the [[Southern Conference]] (SoCon) in 1922. The [[1922 Auburn Tigers football team|1922 team]] is considered one of Auburn's greatest football teams.{{refn|group="n"|It was considered Auburn's best by [[Ed Sherling]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19550116&id=lg0wAAAAIBAJ&sjid=uQQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1645,6354628|title=Auburn's Gator Bowl Champs Rated Among Top Tiger Teams|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=January 16, 1955}}</ref> who Walter Camp gave honorable mention in 1922.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newspapers.com/clip/1937349/camp_1922_all_america/|title=Camp's All America Stars Show Why They Are Winners; Have Brains, Power, Spirit|work=Harrisburg Telegraph|date=December 26, 1922|accessdate=March 8, 2015|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|page=15}} {{Open access}}</ref>}} The Tigers [[upset (sports)|upset]] defending Southern champion [[1922 Centre Praying Colonels football team|Centre]].

===Boozer Pitts (1923–1924; 1927)===
[[File:Boozer Pitts.png|thumb|150px|Boozer Pitts]]
[[Boozer Pitts]] was promoted from assistant coach to Auburn's head football coach, serving from 1923–1924 and again in 1927. Pitts failed to win more than four games in a single season during his tenure that included an 0–4–2 1927 season.

===Dave Morey (1925–1926)===
In September 1925, [[Dave Morey]] was hired as the head football coach. Morey was the head coach at Auburn for three years (1925–1927), compiling an overall record of 10–10–1 at the school. The highlight of Morey's tenure with Auburn was a 2–0 win over [[Bernie Bierman]]'s Tulane squad in the game that dedicated New Orleans' famous Sugar Bowl. In 1927, the Auburn football team lost its starting quarterback, who was expelled after being caught sneaking into the women's dormitory following a night of drunken reverie. The team opened the 1927 season with an 0–3 record, including embarrassing losses to [[Stetson College]] and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. At a pep rally six days after the loss to Clemson, Morey announced his resignation.

===George Bohler (1928–1929)===
[[George Bohler]] was Auburn's head football coach for two seasons from 1928–1929. He posted a 3–11 record in those two seasons before he was replaced due to the poor record and support.

===Chet Wynne (1930–1933)===
[[Chet A. Wynne]] was Auburn's head football coach for four seasons (1930–1933), posting a 22–15–2 record before departing to take the head football coach position at [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]]. Wynne's 1932 team posted a 9–0–1 record and won the [[Southern Conference]] championship in its final year in the conference before moving to the SEC. [[Jimmy Hitchcock]] was consensus All-American.

===Jack Meagher era (1934–1942)===
[[Jack Meagher]] came to Auburn from [[Rice Owls football|Rice]]. Auburn's first bowl appearance came in 1936 under Coach Meagher after a 7–2–2 season. The Tigers traveled to [[Havana, Cuba]] to play Villanova in the [[Bacardi Bowl]], which ended in a 7–7 tie. Auburn's first bowl win came after the 1937 season against [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] in the [[1938 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. Meagher's final record at Auburn in 48–37–10.

===Voyles and Brown (1944–1950)===
Due to the events surrounding [[World War II]], Auburn did not field a team in 1943, but resumed competition in 1944 under [[Carl Voyles]]. During [[Earl Brown (coach)|Earl Brown's]] tenure, Auburn met Alabama for the first time since 1907, which ended with an Alabama victory. The Tigers quickly responded in 1949, as they stunned the heavily favored Crimson Tide in a 14–13 victory. An 0–10 season in 1950 called for a change, and marked the end of a trying era for Auburn football.

===Ralph "Shug" Jordan era (1951–1975)===
In 1951, Auburn hired [[Ralph "Shug" Jordan]] to become the new head coach of the Tigers. During his first season, Auburn finished with a 5–5 record. He led the Tigers to three consecutive bowl appearances in 1953, 1954, and 1955. Jordan is most recognized for his [[1957 Auburn Tigers football team|1957]] squad, which finished the season with a 10–0 record, and won Auburn's first SEC Championship. The Associated Press named the Auburn Tigers no. 1 in its postseason poll, marking the school's first consensus national championship in the modern era. The 1957 Auburn team was ineligible for Bowl participation due to NCAA Sanctions, having been placed on probation indefinitely. The 1958 team was also named national champions by minor selector Montgomery Ratings, after a 9–0–1 season. Auburn went on to appear in bowl games in 1963 and 1965. Beginning in 1968, the Tigers enjoyed seven consecutive bowl appearances under coach Jordan.

In 1970 James Owens, a full back from [[Fairfield, Alabama]] became Auburn's first [[African American]] football player.<ref name=Al.com>{{cite news|last1=Erickson|first1=Joel|title=James Owens, the school's first black football player, leaves a lasting legacy at Auburn with award named for him |url=http://www.al.com/auburnfootball/index.ssf/2012/09/james_owens_the_schools_first.html|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=Al.com|date=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/m-57|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/m-57|publisher=Encyclopedia of Alabama|accessdate=10 March 2015}}</ref> He played for three seasons. He was followed in 1971 by [[Thom Gossom Jr.|Thom Gossom]].

In 1971, Auburn quarterback [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] led the Tigers to a 9–2 record, and became the school's first [[Heisman Trophy]] winner. Auburn would go on to lose the 1972 [[Sugar Bowl]] to Oklahoma, 40–22. One of Jordan's biggest victories came against Alabama in 1972, when the Tigers shocked the Crimson Tide in a 17–16 upset. The 1972 Iron Bowl became known as the "[[Punt Bama Punt]]" game, due to two blocked Alabama punts in the fourth quarter, which were both returned for Auburn touchdowns. In 1973, Auburn's Cliff–Hare Stadium was renamed [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]], which was the first stadium in the nation to be named for an active coach. After the 1975 season, Jordan retired after a 25-year tenure at Auburn, with a 176–83–7 record and a .675 winning percentage. The 176 career wins remain a record for an Auburn coach.

===Doug Barfield era (1976–1980)===
Following Jordan's retirement, Auburn hired [[Doug Barfield]] to become the new head coach. From 1976 to 1980, Barfield's Tigers compiled a 27–27–1 on-field record, with no bowl appearances. He lost all five games to rival Alabama during his tenure, and was later awarded two victories due to forfeits by Mississippi State in 1976 and 1977, making his record 29–25–1. He was dismissed from his position after a disappointing season in 1980, as the Tigers finished with a 5–6 record. Auburn then hired [[Pat Dye]], a former assistant coach at Alabama under Coach Paul W. Bryant, and head coach at [[Wyoming Cowboys football|Wyoming]] at the time. During his first season in [[1981 Auburn Tigers football team|1981]], Auburn finished with a 5–6 record.

===Pat Dye era (1981–1992)===
In [[1982 Auburn Tigers football team|1982]], Pat Dye led Auburn to a 9–3 record and its first bowl appearance in eight years. The 1982 season would also begin a streak of nine consecutive bowl game appearances. The highlight of the season came against Alabama in the Iron Bowl, when Auburn snapped the Tide's 9-game winning streak. The 1982 Iron Bowl is widely known as the "Bo Over the Top" game, for Auburn running back [[Bo Jackson|Bo Jackson's]] leap over the top of a pile from the one-yard line to secure a 23–22 victory over Alabama. This would be the final Iron Bowl for Alabama's legendary coach, [[Bear Bryant]], who retired after the 1982 season and died on January 26, 1983.

Dye's best season came in [[1983 Auburn Tigers football team|1983]], when the Tigers went 11–1, claiming the conference championship. Auburn went on to defeat [[1983 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] in the [[1984 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] 9–7. Some felt that #3 Auburn should have been crowned the national champions, due to #5 Miami's upset of #1 Nebraska in the Orange Bowl, and #7 Georgia's upset of #2 Texas in the Cotton Bowl. Nonetheless, Miami jumped from No. 5 to No. 1 in both the AP and Coaches polls, while Auburn remained in the No. 3 spot behind #2 Nebraska. The 1983 team is recognized by the NCAA as Auburn's third national championship in school history, citing selectors such as the New York Times and Billingsley Report.

In [[1985 Auburn Tigers football team|1985]], running back [[Bo Jackson]] would become the school's second Heisman Trophy winner. Auburn would go on to win three consecutive SEC championships in [[1987 Auburn Tigers football team|1987]], [[1988 Auburn Tigers football team|1988]], and [[1989 Auburn Tigers football team|1989]]. In 1988, defensive tackle [[Tracy Rocker]] became the school's first [[Lombardi Award]] winner and also won the [[Outland Trophy]]. Pat Dye is credited for organizing the first ever Iron Bowl played in Auburn. On December 2, 1989, [[Bill Curry|Bill Curry's]] #2 Crimson Tide (10–0) traveled to [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]], which had surpassed the [[seating capacity]] of [[Legion Field]], to face the #11 Auburn Tigers, who defeated the Tide, 30–20. The 1989 Iron Bowl would continue a 4-game winning streak over Alabama. Since 1981, Auburn is 18–17 in Iron Bowl games.

Dye's tenure on the plains ended when Auburn was penalized for payments by boosters and assistant coaches to a player, [[Eric Ramsey]]. Tape recordings were released that implicated a booster named "Corky" Frost, and former Troy University head coach [[Larry Blakeney]]. The controversy landed the Auburn program a spot on [[60 Minutes]] and an eventual NCAA investigation. While the investigation did not find Dye personally responsible for rules violations, the NCAA determined that as head coach and athletic director, Dye should have known about and stopped the payments to Ramsey. The fallout from the NCAA probation against the football team pushed Dye out as athletic director in 1991, and as head coach the following year.

Over twelve seasons, Dye achieved a 99–39–4 record, the third highest number of wins in Auburn football history, only behind Mike Donahue and Ralph "Shug" Jordan. In 2005, the playing surface of [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]] was named "Pat Dye Field" in honor of Dye's achievements and contributions he made to Auburn during his tenure.

===Terry Bowden era (1993–1998)===
Following the departure of Pat Dye, Auburn named [[Samford Bulldogs football|Samford]] head coach [[Terry Bowden]], son of legendary coach [[Bobby Bowden]], head coach of the Tigers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-12-18/sports/sp-2241_1_terry-bowden|title=Bowden's Son, Terry, New Auburn Coach|work=latimes}}</ref> In [[1993 Auburn Tigers football team|1993]], while serving a one-year television ban and two-year postseason bowl ban due to [[NCAA probation]], Auburn shocked the nation by completing the season with a perfect 11–0 record. The Tigers were not eligible to play in the SEC Championship Game, nor a bowl game, but are recognized by the NCAA as national champions by National Championship Foundation ratings. The most memorable game of the 1994 season was the "Interception Game" versus LSU. In which the Auburn defense intercepted 7 LSU passes, returning 3 for touchdowns in the 4th quarter (Ken Alvis, Fred Smith and Brian Robinson). During the first two seasons under Bowden, the Tigers amassed a 20–1–1 record. After serving two years of probation, Auburn made three consecutive bowl game appearances from 1995 to 1997. Bowden's [[1997 Auburn Tigers football team|1997]] team won the SEC Western Division title, and played in the [[1997 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]], falling to [[1997 Tennessee Volunteers football team|Tennessee]], 30–29. In [[1998 Auburn Tigers football team|1998]], Bowden faced criticism for recruiting woes, off-the-field issues, and player discipline, which eventually led to his resignation after a 1–5 start on the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/27/sports/sp-36668|title=Bowden Explains Sudden Resignation|work=latimes}}</ref> Interim head coach [[Bill Oliver]] finished out the season, which ended with a 3–8 record. Bowden compiled a 47–17–1 record at Auburn after six seasons as head coach.

===Tommy Tuberville era (1999–2008)===
[[File:TommyTuberville.jpg|thumb|Coach Tuberville]]
Following the 1998 season, [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] head coach [[Tommy Tuberville]] left Oxford to become the new head coach of the Auburn Tigers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-29/sports/9811290168_1_tommy-tuberville-defensive-coordinator-bill-oliver-auburn-job|title=Tuberville Takes Over At Auburn|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune}}</ref> In his first season, the Tigers finished with a 5–6 record, but would return to the [[2000 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]] in [[2000 Auburn Tigers football team|2000]], following a 9–0 victory over Alabama, which was played in Tuscaloosa for the first time in 99 years. The Tigers fell to [[2000 Florida Gators football team|Florida]], 28–6, but would begin a streak of eight consecutive bowl appearances. Auburn would win a share of the SEC Western Division title in [[2001 Auburn Tigers football team|2001]] and [[2002 Auburn Tigers football team|2002]]. The high point of the 2002 season was Auburn's 17–7 upset victory over Alabama, which began a six-year winning streak over the Tide. Tuberville's [[2004 Auburn Tigers football team|2004]] team completed the season with a perfect 13–0 record and an [[2004 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship]]. Auburn was left out of the [[2005 Orange Bowl|BCS National Championship Game]], due to two other undefeated teams ranked higher, #1 [[2004 USC Trojans football team|USC]] (12–0) and #2 [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]] (12–0). The Tigers went on to defeat [[2004 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]], 16–13, in the [[2005 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]], completing Auburn's third perfect season in the modern era of college football. USC defeated Oklahoma, 55–19, to win the national championship; however, they were later stripped of their title due to improper recruiting practices. Auburn finished the season ranked No. 2 in the final AP and Coaches polls. The Tigers were recognized as national champions by various polling organizations, including FansPoll and Golf Digest. Tuberville came under much criticism during the [[2008 Auburn Tigers football team|2008]] season for his lackluster performance and coaching staff, including offensive coordinator [[Tony Franklin (coach)|Tony Franklin]], whom he fired after a shocking 14–13 loss to [[2008 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]] in October. At that time, the team was 4–2. Auburn finished the year with a 5–7 record, after a disappointing 36–0 loss to rival [[2008 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] in the Iron Bowl, marking the Tide's first victory over Auburn in Tuscaloosa and snapping Auburn's six-year winning streak. Tuberville voluntarily resigned the following week, stating that he would take a year off from coaching.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3742934|title=Tommy Tuberville resigns as Auburn Tigers coach after 10 years|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> Over ten seasons, Tuberville compiled an 85–40 record at Auburn, while winning one conference championship, five division championships, and completing Auburn's sixth perfect season in school history.

===Gene Chizik era (2009–2012)===
[[File:Gene Chizik June 2011.png|thumb|left|Coach Chizik]]
On December 13, 2008, Athletic Director [[Jay Jacobs (athletics director)|Jay Jacobs]] announced [[Gene Chizik]], former Auburn defensive coordinator and then [[Iowa State Cyclones football|Iowa State]] head coach, as the new Auburn head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3767115|title=Auburn Tigers hire Gene Chizik|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> He received early criticism for his 5–19 record during his time at Iowa State during 2007 and 2008. He quickly began forming his new coaching staff, including offensive coordinator [[Gus Malzahn]], who had coached the nation's top offense at [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]] for the previous two seasons. During his first season, Auburn finished with a 7–5 record, and defeated [[2009 Northwestern Wildcats football team|Northwestern]] 38–35 in the [[2010 Outback Bowl|Outback Bowl]], its first bowl game since 2007.

Following the 2009 season, Chizik and his staff recruited a top-5 recruiting class, highlighted by junior college transfer quarterback [[Cam Newton]] and running back [[Mike Dyer (American football)|Mike Dyer]]. Auburn's 2010 "A-Day" spring scrimmage drew a crowd of 63,217 fans to Jordan–Hare Stadium, setting a new spring game attendance record. Auburn, led by quarterback [[Cam Newton]], running back [[Michael Dyer]], and defensive tackle [[Nick Fairley]], completed the regular season with a perfect 12–0 record, highlighted by a comeback victory over [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tide led Auburn 24–0 in the first half, only to lose the game in the second half, 28–27. It was the largest lead ever blown by Alabama in Tuscaloosa and the largest ever comeback through the 75-year history of the game. Auburn went on to defeat [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]] 56–17 in the [[2010 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]], which secured a spot in the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship Game]]. This would be the first [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] bowl game appearance for Auburn since 2004, when the Tigers were left out of the national championship picture. [[Cam Newton]] became the third Heisman Trophy winner in school history, while also winning the [[Associated Press College Football Player of the Year Award|AP Player of the Year Award]], the [[Walter Camp Award]], the [[Davey O'Brien Award]], the [[Manning Award]], and the [[Maxwell Award]]. Nick Fairley became the second Auburn player in school history to win the [[Lombardi Award]]. Auburn faced the [[2010 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon Ducks]] on January 10, 2011 in Glendale, Arizona, which ended with a 22–19 Auburn victory, secured by a game-winning field goal kick by senior Wes Byrum, who also kicked the game-winning field goals against [[2010 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] and [[2010 Kentucky Wildcats football team|Kentucky]] during the regular season. Auburn finished the season with a perfect 14–0 record, and its first consensus national championship since 1957. Auburn celebrated their national championship with a special ceremony at Jordan–Hare Stadium two weeks following the championship game in Arizona. The coaches and players were honored, along with players from the 1957, 1993, and 2004 undefeated teams. The event drew over 78,000 fans, covering Jordan–Hare Stadium lower decks, spilling into both upper decks. A special "reverse" Tiger Walk and special rolling of Toomer's Corner also took place. After settling down from the magical 2010 season, Chizik and his staff began preparing to defend their national title.

Auburn opened the 2011 season with dramatic wins against [[2011 Utah State Aggies football team|Utah State]] and [[2011 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]]. Auburn then fell to eventual ACC Champion [[2011 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] on the road in Death Valley, which snapped Auburn's 17-game winning streak, which began on January 1, 2010, vs. Northwestern in Outback Bowl. The Tigers would go on to complete the regular season with a 7–5 record and ranked no. 25 in the final BCS poll, with wins against Florida Atlantic, no. 9 South Carolina, Florida, Ole Miss, and Samford. Auburn fell to Arkansas, LSU (SEC Champions), Georgia (eastern division champion), and arch-rival Alabama (National Champions). The Tigers won their 37th bowl appearance by a score of 43–24 over the [[2011 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia Cavaliers]] in the [[2011 Chick-fil-A Bowl]] on December 31, 2011. This would be Gus Malzahn's final game as offensive coordinator for Auburn before becoming head coach at [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]]. Defensive coordinator Ted Roof would also depart following the 2011 season, leaving for [[Central Florida Golden Knights football|UCF]].

Following a 3–9 (0–8 in conference play) season in 2012, the program's worst season in 60 years, Chizik was terminated as head football coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8674097/gene-chizik-fired-auburn-tigers|title=Gene Chizik fired by Auburn Tigers|work=ESPN.com}}</ref> In addition to the remarkably poor 2012 season, mounting player disciplinary issues and the lack of on-field success delivered from several consecutive highly rated recruiting classes contributed to Chizik's firing. Over his four season tenure as head coach at Auburn, Chizik compiled an overall record of 33–19 (15–17 in conference play), delivering one SEC Championship and a National Championship in 2010 and three consecutive bowl wins from 2009 to 2011 before not qualifying for a bowl in 2012.

===Gus Malzahn era (2013–present)===
After Gene Chizik's termination at the end of the 2012 season, Athletic Director Jay Jacobs formed a search committee headed by former Auburn Heisman Trophy winners [[Bo Jackson]] and [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] along with fellow former player Mac Crawford to find the program's next head coach. The committee unanimously selected [[Arkansas State University|Arkansas State]] head coach and former Auburn offensive coordinator from 2009 to 2011 [[Gus Malzahn]].<ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/stewart_mandel/12/04/gus-malzahn-auburn/ ] {{wayback|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/stewart_mandel/12/04/gus-malzahn-auburn/ |date=20121208052810 }}</ref> On December 4, 2012, it was officially announced that Malzahn would assume the position of head coach at Auburn University.<ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com"/> He is currently{{When|date=March 2016}} in his third season, and his 2013 Tigers went 12–2 and won the SEC Championship versus the [[2013 Missouri Tigers football team|Missouri Tigers]]. The season was highlighted by two of the greatest{{According to whom|date=March 2016}} plays in Auburn football history. After allowing number 25 Georgia to take a 38–37 lead with less than two minutes remaining, quarterback Nick Marshall threw a 73-yard [[Hail Mary]] pass to Ricardo Louis for the game-winning touchdown after being tipped up by two Georgia defenders. The Tigers put the game away in the final 25 seconds and won 43–38 over the Bulldogs. Auburn also defeated number 1 Alabama in dramatic fashion. After lobbying for one second to be restored to the game clock in the fourth quarter, tied 28–28 with the Tigers, Alabama head coach [[Nick Saban]] chose to attempt a 57-yard game-winning field goal. The Tide was 0–3 in field goal attempts on the day with veteran kicker Cade Foster, thus chose to use Adam Griffith for the final attempt. Griffith's kick did not have the distance and the ball landed in the hands of Chris Davis, who returned the ball unofficially 109 yards end zone to end zone for an Auburn touchdown and sealed a victory for the Tigers along with a berth in the SEC Championship Game. Auburn would face number 5 Missouri in the [[2013 SEC Championship Game]], eventually winning 59–42 in an offensive showdown which produced 677 total yards for Auburn, including a 304-yard performance by game MVP Tre Mason. The Tigers faced number 1 Florida State in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]] in Pasadena, California, on January 6, 2014. They lost by a score of 34–31, as Florida State scored the go-ahead touchdown with thirteen seconds remaining in the game, ending the SEC streak of winning BCS national championships at seven. They were only the second SEC team to lose in a BCS championship game, and the only SEC team to do so against non-SEC competition. The Tigers finished number 2 in both the final AP and Coaches polls. Since the end of the 2013 season Malzahn's Auburn Tigers have compiled a record of 27–13 and 13-11 in SEC play. Auburn finished 8–5 in 2014, including a 34–31 loss to Wisconsin in the 2014 Outback Bowl.<ref name="espn.com">{{cite web|author=Final/OT |url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/boxscore?gameId=400610219 |title=Auburn vs. Wisconsin - Box Score - January 1, 2015 - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2015-01-01 |accessdate=2015-12-15}}</ref> Before the 2015 season, Auburn was ranked number six and was supposed to be in the mix for the [[College Football Playoff]] but, after a almost upset by FCS Jacksonville State and an embarrassing loss at thirteen ranked LSU at the beginning of the season, those dreams were gone. Auburn compiled a 6–6 record, 2-6 in the SEC and a trip to the [[2015 Birmingham Bowl (December)|Birmingham Bowl]] to face [[2015 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]]. Auburn defeated Memphis 31–10 in front of a crowd of 59,430, to end its season with a 7–6 record. This season was considered the worst since the 2012 season when Auburn went 3-9 and 0-8 in SEC play. The upcoming 2016 season is a make it or break for Malzahn due to the past two seasons.

===Recent history===
{{main|List of Auburn Tigers football seasons}}
The Auburn Tigers have had uneven success in recent{{When|date=March 2016}} years. Since the expansion of the SEC in 1992, Auburn has the fourth-highest win percentage in SEC West league play (58.7%), behind Alabama, LSU and Texas A&M, respectively.<ref>{{cite web|year=2013|url=http://football.stassen.com/cgi-bin/records/conference.pl?start=1869&end=2012&team=Alabama&team=Arkansas&team=Auburn&team=LouisianaState&team=Mississippi&team=MississippiState&team=TexasAM|title=Conference Record 1992–2012 (SEC West)|publisher=Stassen College Football Information|accessdate=2013-06-25}}</ref> At of the end of the 2012 season, Auburn teams had won 45 of their last 74 conference match-ups, including 20 of the last 36 SEC away games.

====2013 season====
{{main|2013 Auburn Tigers football team}}
Following a 3–9 season in 2012, Auburn was poised to begin a "new day"{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} under the leadership of head coach [[Gus Malzahn]] in 2013. The Tigers were picked{{By whom|date=March 2016}} to finish fifth in the SEC West, and received no votes in any preseason polls. Auburn would go on to complete what has been coined{{By whom|date=March 2016}} as the greatest turnaround in college football history, finishing the regular season with an 11–1 record. The only loss came against number 6 LSU in a night game at Tiger Stadium, where the Tigers suffered a 21–35 defeat. The season is best known{{According to whom|date=March 2016}} for Auburn's finishes against rivals Georgia and Alabama, dubbed [[The Prayer at Jordan-Hare]] and [[Kick Six]] respectively. Auburn would go on to defeat number 5 Missouri 59–42 in the [[2013 SEC Championship Game]] and claim its third conference championship in ten years, the most of any SEC program during that period. Auburn's offense was anchored by a rushing attack under the leadership of running back and Heisman Trophy finalist [[Tre Mason]], who rushed for 1,816 total yards, surpassing Bo Jackson's single-season record of 1,786 yards. Auburn faced number 1 Florida State in the Rose Bowl for the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]], falling to the Seminoles in the final seconds, 31–34. Auburn finished the season ranked number 2 in both the AP and Coaches final polls after completing a 12–2 turnaround season, which marked its second SEC title and BCS Championship appearance in four years.

The 1913 team was coached by [[Mike Donahue]] and was undefeated at 8–0, outscoring opponents 224–13. Auburn, led by senior captain Kirk Newell, finished as SIAA champions for the first time in school history. Newell, also a member of the Upsilon Chapter of [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], went on to be a World War I hero and member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view=company&refno=252&srctype=company_detail|title=Alabama Sports Hall of Fame and Museum – Birmingham, Alabama|work=ashof.org}}</ref> The Tigers were retroactively awarded a national title by The Billingsley Report.

{{main|1957 Auburn Tigers football team}}
The 1957 Auburn Tigers, led by coach Ralph "Shug" Jordan, finished with a perfect 10–0 record, marking the school's first ever SEC championship. Auburn was recognized as national champions by the AP Poll even though they were on probation and did not participate in a bowl game. This was the school's first recognized national championship. The 1957 title is shared with Ohio State, who was named the national champion by the Coaches' Poll. This was the first of only two times in the history of the AP championship that it was awarded to a team on probation not allowed to participate in a bowl game (it would occur again in 1974 with Oklahoma).

====1983 season====
{{main|1983 Auburn Tigers football team}}
The 1983 Auburn Tigers, led by head coach [[Pat Dye]] and running back [[Bo Jackson]], finished 11–1 after playing the nation's toughest schedule. Their only loss came against #3 Texas, who defeated the Tigers, 20–7. Auburn went on to defeat #8 Michigan, 9–7, in the [[1984 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]]. Despite entering the bowl games ranked third in both major polls, and with both teams ranked higher losing their bowl games, the Tigers ended ranked third in the final AP poll. The New York Times ranked Auburn number one at the conclusion of the season, but several other retroactive polling found Auburn at number 1, including the Billingsley Report. The universally recognized national champions for 1983 are the Miami Hurricanes.

====1993 season====
{{main|1993 Auburn Tigers football team}}
Head coach [[Terry Bowden]] led the 1993 team to a perfect season in his first year on the Plains. The Tigers were the only undefeated team in major college football, however were banned from playing on television or post-season games due to NCAA violations. Rival Alabama was sent to the SEC Championship Game as the substitute representative of the Western Division. Auburn finished ranked fourth in the nation by the Associated Press. However, Auburn was on NCAA probation in 1993 and ineligible for post season play.

====2010 season====
{{main|2010 Auburn Tigers football team}}

On October 24, 2010, Auburn was ranked first in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS polls]] for the first time in school history. On January 10, 2011, Auburn defeated Oregon in the BCS National Championship Game in Glendale, Arizona, 22–19, to win their first BCS National Championship, and second claimed national title.

==Traditions==

===Tiger Walk===
Before each Auburn home football game, thousands of Auburn fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they walk from the Auburn Athletic Complex to [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]]. The tradition began in the 1950s when groups of kids would walk up the street to greet the team and get autographs. During the tenure of coach [[Doug Barfield]], the coach urged fans to come out and support the team, and thousands did. Today the team walks down the hill and into the stadium surrounded by fans who pat them on the back and shake their hands as they walk. The largest Tiger Walk occurred on December 2, 1989, before the first ever home football game against rival [[University of Alabama|Alabama]]—the [[Iron Bowl]]. On that day, an estimated 20,000 fans packed the one block section of road leading to the stadium. According to former athletic director [[David E. Housel|David Housel]], Tiger Walk has become "the most copied tradition in all of college football".<ref>{{cite web |year=2003|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/maisel/031120auburn.html|title=The best Walk in America|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=2007-10-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008075442/http://espn.go.com/page2/s/maisel/031120auburn.html|archivedate=8 October 2007 |deadurl=no}}</ref>

==="War Eagle"===
[[File:GoldenEagle-Nova.jpg|thumb|right|Nova, "War Eagle VII"]]
{{main|War Eagle}}
There are many stories surrounding the origins of Auburn's battle cry, "War Eagle". The most popular account involves the first Auburn football game in 1892 between Auburn and the [[University of Georgia]]. According to the story, in the stands that day was an old Civil War soldier with an eagle that he had found injured on a battlefield and kept as a pet. The eagle broke free and began to soar over the field, and Auburn began to march toward the Georgia end-zone. The crowd began to chant, "War Eagle" as the eagle soared. After Auburn won the game, the eagle crashed to the field and died but, according to the legend, his spirit lives on every time an Auburn man or woman yells "War Eagle!" The battle cry of "War Eagle" also functions as a greeting for those associated with the University. For many years, a live [[golden eagle]] has embodied the spirit of this tradition. The eagle was once housed on campus in The A. Elwyn Hamer Jr. Aviary (which was the second largest single-bird enclosure in the country), but the aviary was taken down in 2003 and the eagle moved to a nearby raptor center. The eagle, War Eagle VI (nicknamed "Tiger"), was trained in 2000 to fly free around the stadium before every home game to the delight of fans. The present eagle, War Eagle VII (nicknamed "Nova"), continues the tradition. War Eagle VI is believed to be the inspiration behind the 2005–2006 Auburn Cheerleading squad's chant, "Tigers, Tigers, Gooooooo Tigers!"

===Toomer's Corner===
The intersection of Magnolia and College streets in Auburn, which marks the transition from downtown Auburn to the university campus, is known as Toomer's Corner. It is named after Toomer's Drugs, a small store on the corner that has been an Auburn landmark since 1896. Hanging over the corner were two massive old oak trees, planted in 1937, and whenever there was cause for celebration in the Auburn community, [[toilet paper]] could usually be found hanging from the trees. Also known as "rolling the corner," this tradition was thought to have originated in the 1970s and until the mid-1990s was relegated to only to celebrating athletic wins.

The oak trees were cut down by the university in April, 2013, as a result of them being poisoned by Harvey Updyke Jr., a fan of rival Alabama.

===Wreck Tech Pajama Parade===
The Wreck Tech Pajama Parade originated in the 1930s, when a group of mischievous Auburn [[ROTC]] cadets, determined to show up the more well-known engineers from [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], sneaked out of their dorms the night before the football game between Auburn and Tech and greased the railroad tracks. According to the story, the train carrying the Georgia Tech team slid through town and didn't stop until it was halfway to the neighboring town of [[Loachapoka, Alabama]]. The Georgia Tech team was forced to walk the five miles back to Auburn and, not surprisingly, were rather weary at the end of their journey. This likely contributed to their 45–0 loss. While the railroad long ago ceased to be the way teams traveled to Auburn and students never greased the tracks again, the tradition continues in the form of a parade through downtown Auburn. Students parade through the streets in their pajamas and organizations build floats.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barnhart|first=Tony|title=Southern fried football: the history, passion, and glory of the great Southern game|year=2000|publisher=Triumph|isbn=978-1-60078-093-6 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QR8MAAAAYAAJ&q=Wreck+Tech+Pajama+Parade&dq=Wreck+Tech+Pajama+Parade|page=49}}</ref>

==The Iron Bowl==
The [[Iron Bowl]] is played annually on Thanksgiving weekend between Auburn and Alabama, and is widely reckoned as the most bitter rivalry in college football. The game was first played from 1893 to 1906 but was suspended for 42 years. The game resumed in 1949 and the rivalry has blossomed into one of the biggest games of the year. The winners of the past 5 out of 6 Iron Bowls have gone on to play in the BCS national championship game. While Alabama leads the overall series 43–35–1, Auburn has won nine out of the 14 meetings since it became a home-and-home series in 2000.

==Bowl games==
Auburn football teams have been invited to participate in 40 total bowls and have garnered a record of 23–15–2. Auburn [[list of NCAA football bowl records|ranks]] as one of the best programs in the nation in success in bowl games. Auburn ranks 16th in all-time bowl appearances with 40, 10th in all-time bowl wins with 23, and 5th in all-time bowl win percentage (minimum of 20 games) at .622. Most recently, Auburn beat the [[2015 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis Tigers]] in the [[2015 Birmingham Bowl (December)|Birmingham Bowl]], 31–10, on December 30, 2015. Auburn faced #1 Florida State in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]] in Pasadena, California on January 6, 2014. They lost by a score of 34–31. It was the Tigers' second BCS Championship appearance in four years.
