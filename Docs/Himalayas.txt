The '''Himalayas''' or '''Himalaya''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|ɪ|m|ə|ˈ|l|eɪ|.|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|h|ɪ|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|ə|j|ə}}) is a [[mountain range]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]], which separates the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] from the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. Geopolitically, it covers the [[Himalayan states and regions]]. This range is home to [[list of highest mountains|nine of the ten highest peaks on Earth]], including the highest above sea level, [[Mount Everest]]. The Himalayas have profoundly shaped the cultures of South Asia. Many Himalayan peaks are sacred in [[Dharmic]] religions such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]].

The Himalayas are bordered on the north by the Tibetan Plateau, on the south by the Indo-Gangetic Plain, on the northwest by the [[Karakoram]] and [[Hindu Kush]] ranges and on the east by the Indian states of [[Sikkim]], the [[Darjeeling]] district of [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and [[Manipur]]. The Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalayas together form the "Hindu Kush Himalayan Region" (HKH).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212094714000929 |title=Mapping the vulnerability hotspots over Hindu-Kush Himalaya region to flooding disasters  |access-date=2015-09-06 |doi=10.1016/j.wace.2014.12.001 |volume=8 |pages=46–58 |journal=Weather and Climate Extremes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icimod.org/?q=1137 |title=Regional Information |periodical=icimod.org |access-date=2015-09-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assess-hkh.at/downloads/Poster1_ASSESS_HKH_scientific.pdf |title=Development of an ASSESSment system to evaluate the ecological status of rivers in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region |periodical=assess-hkh.at |access-date=2015-09-06}}</ref> The western anchor of the Himalayas, [[Nanga Parbat]], lies just south of the northernmost bend of the [[Indus River]];  the eastern anchor, [[Namcha Barwa]], is just west of the great bend of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]].

Lifted by the collision of the [[Indian Plate|Indian tectonic plate]] with the [[Eurasian Plate]],<ref name=USGS/> the Himalayan range runs northwest to southeast in a {{Convert|2400|km|mi|adj = on}}-long arc. The range varies in width from {{Convert|400|km|mi}} in the west to {{Convert|150|km|mi}} in the east. Besides the Greater Himalayas, there are several parallel lower ranges. The southernmost, along the northern edge of the Indian plains and reaching 1000 m in altitude, is the [[Sivalik Hills]]. Further north is a higher range, reaching 2000–3000 m, known as the [[Lower Himalayan Range]].

Three of the world's major rivers (the [[Indus River|Indus]], the [[Ganges]] and the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]) arise in the Himalayas. While the Indus and the Brahmaputra rise near [[Mount Kailash]] in [[Tibet]], the Ganges rises in the Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]]. Their combined [[drainage basin]] is home to some 600 million people.

==Etymology==
The name ''Himālaya'' is from [[Sanskrit]]: ''hima'' (snow) + ''ālaya'' (dwelling), and literally means "abode of snow".<ref name=oed>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0378930#m_en_gb0378930|title=Definition of Himalayas|work=Oxford Dictionaries Online|accessdate=9 May 2011}}</ref>

==Ecology==
{{main|Ecology of the Himalaya}}
The flora and fauna of the Himalayas vary with climate, rainfall, altitude, and soils. The climate ranges from tropical at the base of the mountains to permanent ice and snow at the highest elevations. The amount of yearly rainfall increases from west to east along the southern front of the range. This diversity of altitude, rainfall and soil conditions combined with the very high snow line supports a variety of distinct plant and animal communities. The extremes of high altitude (low atmospheric pressure) combined with extreme cold favor [[extremophile]] organisms.<ref>{{cite web|first=C. Michael|last=Hogan|year=2010|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/160977/|title=Extremophile|editor1-first=E.|editor1-last=Monosson |work=Encyclopedia of Earth|publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment|location=Washington DC}}</ref>

The unique floral and faunal wealth of the Himalayas is undergoing structural and compositional changes due to [[climate change]]. The increase in temperature is shifting various species to higher elevations. The oak forest is being invaded by pine forests in the Garhwal Himalayan region. There are reports of early flowering and fruiting in some tree species, especially [[rhododendron]], apple and ''[[Myrica esculenta|box myrtle]]''. The highest known tree species in the Himalayas is ''[[Juniperus tibetica]]'' located at {{convert|4900|m|ft|-1}} in Southeastern Tibet.<ref name>{{cite journal|url=http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|title=Highest Treeline in the Northern Hemisphere Found in Southern Tibet|first1=Georg|last1=Miehe|first2=Sabine|last2=Miehe|first3=Jonas|last3=Vogel|first4=Sonam|last4=Co|first5=La|last5=Duo|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=27|issue=2|date=May 2007|pages=169–173|doi=10.1659/mrd.0792|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606103046/http://www.uni-marburg.de/fb19/personal/professoren/miehe/pdfs/20074.pdf|archivedate=6 June 2013}}</ref>

==Geology==
[[File:Himalaya-formation.gif|thumb|The 6,000 kilometers plus journey of the India landmass (Indian Plate) before its collision with Asia (Eurasian Plate) about 40 to 50 million years ago<ref name=USGS/>]]
{{Main|Geology of the Himalaya}}
The Himalayan range is one of the youngest mountain ranges on the planet and consists mostly of uplifted [[sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]]. According to the modern theory of [[plate tectonics]], its formation is a result of a [[continental collision]] or [[orogeny]] along the [[convergent boundary]] between the [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The [[Arakan Yoma]] highlands in [[Burma|Myanmar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] were also formed as a result of this collision.

During the [[Upper Cretaceous]], about 70 million years ago, the north-moving Indo-Australian plate (which has subsequently broken into the [[Indian Plate]] and the [[Australian plate]]<ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/95/18688.html (1995) Geologists Find: An Earth Plate Is Breaking in Two]</ref>) was moving at about 15&nbsp;cm per year.  About 50 million years ago this fast moving Indo-Australian plate had completely closed the [[Tethys Ocean]], the existence of which has been determined by [[sedimentary rock]]s settled on the ocean floor, and the volcanoes that fringed its edges. Since both plates were composed of low density [[continental crust]], they were [[thrust fault]]ed and [[Fold (geology)|folded]] into mountain ranges rather than subducting into the [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] along an [[oceanic trench]].<ref name=USGS/> An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine [[limestone]] from this ancient ocean.<ref>[http://geology.about.com/library/bl/peaks/bleverest.htm A site which uses this dramatic fact first used in illustration of "deep time" in John McPhee's book '''Basin and Range''']</ref>

Today, the Indian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to continue to move upwards. The Indian plate is still moving at 67&nbsp;mm per year, and over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500&nbsp;km into Asia. About 20&nbsp;mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by [[Thrust fault|thrusting]] along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5&nbsp;mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also makes this region [[seismic]]ally active, leading to earthquakes from time to time.

During the last [[ice age]], there was a connected ice stream of [[glacier]]s between [[Kangchenjunga]] in the east and [[Nanga Parbat]] in the west.<ref name=Kuhle2011/><ref>glacier maps [http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780444534477/ downloadable]</ref> In the west, the glaciers joined with the ice stream network in the [[Karakoram]], and in the north, joined with the former Tibetan inland ice. To the south, outflow glaciers came to an end below an elevation of {{convert|1000|-|2000|m|ft}}.<ref name=Kuhle2011/><ref name=Kuhle1987/> While the current valley glaciers of the Himalaya reach at most {{convert|20|to|32|km|mi}} in length, several of the main valley glaciers were {{convert|60|to|112|km}} long during the ice age.<ref name=Kuhle2011/> The glacier snowline (the altitude where accumulation and [[Ablation#Glaciology|ablation]] of a glacier are balanced) was about {{convert|1400|-|1660|m|ft}} lower than it is today. Thus, the climate was at least {{convert|7.0|to|8.3|C-change|F-change}} colder than it is today.<ref name=Kuhle2005/>

==Hydrology==
[[File:13-10-08 217 CONFLUENCE OF INDUS RIVER N.jpg|thumb|Indus River]]
[[File:yumthangnorth.jpg|thumb|The Himalayan range at Yumesongdong in [[Sikkim]], in the [[Yumthang]] River valley]]
The Himalayas contain the third-largest deposit of ice and snow in the world, after [[Antarctica]] and the [[Arctic]].<ref name=pbs_nature/> The Himalayan range encompasses about 15,000 glaciers, which store about 12,000&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (3,000 cubic miles) of fresh water.<ref name=IPPC2007/> Its glaciers include the [[Gangotri Glacier|Gangotri]] and [[Yamunotri]] ([[Uttarakhand]]) and [[Khumbu Glacier|Khumbu]] glaciers ([[Mount Everest]] region), [[Langtang]] glacier ([[Langtang]] region) and [[Zemu Glacier|Zemu]] ([[Sikkim]]).

Owing to the mountains' latitude near the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the permanent [[snow line]] is among the highest in the world at typically around {{convert|5500|m|ft|-2}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shi|first1=Yafeng|last2=Xie|first2=Zizhu|last3=Zheng|first3=Benxing|last4=Li|first4=Qichun|url=http://itia.ntua.gr/hsj/redbooks/126/iahs_126_0111.pdf|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CwdX03t7|archivedate=2012-12-16|title=Distribution, Feature and Variations of Glaciers in China|journal=World Glacier Inventory|year=1978|publisher=Riederalp Workshop}}</ref> In contrast, equatorial mountains in [[New Guinea]], the [[Rwenzoris]] and [[Colombia]] have a snow line some {{convert|900|m|ft|-1}} lower.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Henderson-Sellers|first1=Ann|last2=McGuffie|first2=Kendal|title=The Future of the World's Climate: A Modelling Perspective|pages=199–201|isbn=9780123869173}}</ref> The higher regions of the Himalayas are snowbound throughout the year, in spite of their proximity to the tropics, and they form the sources of several large [[perennial stream|perennial rivers]], most of which combine into two large river systems:
* The western rivers, of which the [[Indus River|Indus]] is the largest, combine into the ''Indus Basin''. The Indus begins in Tibet at the confluence of Sengge and Gar rivers and flows southwest through India and then through Pakistan to the [[Arabian Sea]]. It is fed by the [[Jhelum River|Jhelum]], the [[Chenab]], the [[Ravi River|Ravi]], the [[Beas River|Beas]], and the [[Sutlej]] rivers, among others.
* Most of the other Himalayan rivers drain the ''Ganges-Brahmaputra Basin''. Its main rivers are the [[Ganges River|Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra]] and the [[Yamuna]], as well as other tributaries. The Brahmaputra originates as the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] in western Tibet, and flows east through Tibet and west through the plains of [[Assam]]. The Ganges and the Brahmaputra meet in [[Bangladesh]], and drain into the [[Bay of Bengal]] through the world's largest [[river delta]], the [[Sunderbans]].<ref name=gits4u/>

The easternmost Himalayan rivers feed the [[Irrawaddy River]], which originates in eastern Tibet and flows south through Myanmar to drain into the [[Andaman Sea]].

The [[Salween]], [[Mekong]], [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Huang He]] (Yellow River) all originate from parts of the Tibetan Plateau that are geologically distinct from the Himalaya mountains, and are therefore not considered true Himalayan rivers. Some geologists refer to all the rivers collectively as the ''circum-Himalayan rivers''.<ref name=circum/>
In recent years, scientists have monitored a notable increase in the rate of [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|glacier retreat]] across the region as a result of global climate change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/42387/story.htm|title=Vanishing Himalayan Glaciers Threaten a Billion|date=5 June 2007|publisher=Planet Ark|accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref> For example, glacial lakes have been forming rapidly on the surface of debris-covered glaciers in the Bhutan Himalaya during the last few decades. Although the effect of this will not be known for many years, it potentially could mean disaster for the hundreds of millions of people who rely on the glaciers to feed the rivers during the dry seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90781/90879/6222327.html|title=Glaciers melting at alarming speed|date=24 July 2007|publisher=People's Daily Online|accessdate=17 April 2009}}</ref>

===Lakes===
[[Image:Tilicho Lake.jpg|thumb|Tilicho lake in [[Manang]], Nepal]]
The Himalayan region is dotted with hundreds of lakes. Most lakes are found at altitudes of less than 5,000 m, with the size of the lakes diminishing with altitude. [[Tilicho Lake]] in Nepal in the Annapurna massif is one of the highest lakes in the world. [[Pangong Tso]], which is spread across the border between India and China, and [[Yamdrok Tso]], located in central Tibet, are amongst the largest with surface areas of 700&nbsp;km², and 638&nbsp;km², respectively. Other notable lakes include [[Phoksundo Lake|She-Phoksundo Lake]] in the [[Shey Phoksundo National Park]] of Nepal, [[Gurudongmar Lake]], in [[North Sikkim]], [[Gokyo Lakes]] in [[Solukhumbu]] district of [[Nepal]] and [[Lake Tsongmo]], near the Indo-China border in Sikkim.

Some of the lakes present a danger of a [[glacial lake outburst flood]]. The [[Tsho Rolpa]] glacier lake in the [[Rolwaling Himal|Rowaling Valley]], in the [[Dolakha District]] of Nepal, is rated as the most dangerous. The lake, which is located at an altitude of {{convert|4580|m|ft}} has grown considerably over the last 50 years due to glacial melting.<ref>[http://rolwaling.tripod.com/glof/ Photograph of Tsho Rolpa]</ref><ref>[[Glacial lake outburst flood#Monitoring|Tsho Rolpa]]</ref>

The mountain lakes are known to geographers as ''[[tarn (lake)|tarns]]'' if they are caused by glacial activity. Tarns are found mostly in the upper reaches of the Himalaya, above 5,500 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highestlake.com/highest-lake-world.html|title=Highest Lake in the World|first=Carl|last=Drews|accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref>

==Impact on climate==
The Himalayas have a profound effect on the climate of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Tibetan Plateau. They prevent frigid, dry winds from blowing south into the subcontinent, which keeps South Asia much warmer than corresponding [[temperate]] regions in the other continents. It also forms a barrier for the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|monsoon]] winds, keeping them from traveling northwards, and causing heavy rainfall in the [[Terai]] region. The Himalayas are also believed to play an important part in the formation of Central Asian deserts, such as the [[Taklamakan]] and [[Gobi]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Devitt|first=Terry|title=Climate shift linked to rise of Himalayas, Tibetan Plateau|newspaper=University of Wisconsin–Madison News|date=3 May 2001|url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/6138|accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>

==Religions of the region==
[[Image:Taktshang.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Paro Taktsang|Taktsang]] Monastery, also known as the "Tiger's Nest"]]
In Hinduism, the Himalayas have been personified as the god [[Himavat]], father of [[Ganges in Hinduism|Ganga]]  and [[Parvati]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend|isbn=0-500-51088-1|first=Anna|last=Dallapiccola|year=2002}}</ref>

Several places in the Himalayas are of religious significance in Buddhism, Hinduism, [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]]. A notable example of a religious site is [[Paro Taktsang]], where [[Padmasambhava]] is said to have founded Buddhism in Bhutan.<ref name="Pommaret">{{cite book|author=Pommaret, Francoise|title=Bhutan Himalayan Mountains Kingdom|edition=5th|publisher=Odyssey Books and Guides|year=2006|pages=136–7|isbn=978-9622178106}}</ref> Padmasambhava is also worshipped as the patron saint of Sikkim.

A number of [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhist]] sites are situated in the Himalayas, in [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]] and in the Indian regions of [[Ladakh]], [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Spiti Valley|Spiti]] and [[Darjeeling]]. There were over 6,000 [[List of Tibetan monasteries|monasteries]] in Tibet, including the residence of the [[Dalai Lama]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7307495.stm|title=Tibetan monks: A controlled life|publisher=BBC News|date=20 March 2008}}</ref> Bhutan, Sikkim and Ladakh are also dotted with numerous monasteries. The [[Tibetan Muslims]] have their own mosques in [[Lhasa]] and [[Shigatse]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200510/27/eng20051027_217176.html|title=Mosques in Lhasa, Tibet|newspaper=People's Daily Online|date=27 October 2005}}</ref>

== Resources ==
The Himalayas are home to a diversity of medicinal resources. Plants from the forests have been used for millennia to treat conditions ranging from simple coughs to snake bites.<ref name = JEE>{{cite web
|url= http://ethnobiomed.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1746-4269-9-1

|access-date=22 January 2016}}</ref>
Different parts of the plants - root, flower, stem, leaves, and bark - are used as remedies for different ailments. For example, a bark extract from an ''abies pindrow'' tree is used to treat coughs and bronchitis. Leaf and stem paste from an ''arachne cordifolia'' is used for wounds and as an antidote for snake bites. The bark of a ''callicarpa arborea'' is used for skin ailments.<ref name=JEE /> Nearly a fifth of the [[gymnosperm]]s, [[Flowering plants|angiosperms]], and [[pteridophyte]]s in the Himalayas are found to have medicinal properties, and more are likely to be discovered.<ref name=JEE/>

Most of the population in some Asian and African countries depend on medicinal plants rather than prescriptions and such (Gupta and Sharma, vii).<ref name=":1">Gupta, Pankaj and Sharma, Vijay Kumar, Author. Healing Traditions of the Northwestern Himalayas. 2014. Print. SpringerBriefs in Environmental Science.</ref> Since so many people use medicinal plants as their only source of healing in the Himalayas, the plants are an important source of income. This contributes to economic and modern industrial development both inside and outside the region (Gupta and Sharma, 5).<ref name=":1" /> The only problem is that locals are rapidly clearing the forests on the Himalayas for wood, often illegally (Earth Island Journal, 2).<ref>"Himalayan Forests Disappearing." Earth Island Journal 21.4 (2006): 7-8. Academic Search Complete. Web. 2 Nov. 2015.</ref> This means that the number of medicinal plants is declining and that some of them might become rarer or, in some cases, go extinct.

Although locals are clearing out portions of the forests in the Himalayas, there is still a large amount of greenery ranging from the tropical forests to the Alpine forests. These forests provide wood for fuel and other raw materials for use by industries. There are also many pastures for animals to graze upon (Mohita, sec. Forest and Wealth).<ref name=":2">Mohita, Negi. "Himalayas: 10 Significance of the Himalaya Mountains to India (Notes)."YourArticleLibrarycom The Next Generation Library. N.p., 21 Nov. 2013. Web. 11 Nov. 2015.</ref> The many varieties of animals that live in these mountains do so based on the elevation. For example, elephants and rhinoceros live in the lower elevations of the Himalayas, also called the Terai region. Also, found in these mountains are the Kashmiri stag, black bears, musk deer, langur, and snow leopards. The Tibetan yak are also found on these mountains and are often used by the people for transportation. However, the populations of many of these animals and still others are declining and are on the verge of going extinct (Admin, sec. Flora and Fauna).<ref name=":3">Admin. "King of Mountains: The Himalayas." Knowledge Of India. N.p., 20 Mar. 2015. Web. 10 Nov. 2015.</ref>

The Himalayas are also a source of many minerals and precious stones. Amongst the tertiary rocks, are vast potentials of mineral oil. There is coal located in Kashmir, and precious stones located in the Himalayas. There is also gold, silver, copper, zinc, and many other such minerals and metals located in at least 100 different places in these mountains (Mohita, sec. Minerals).<ref name=":2" />

== Culture ==
There are many cultural aspects of the Himalayas. For the Hindus, the Himalayas are personified as Himavath, the father of the goddess Parvati (Gupta and Sharma, 4).<ref name=":1" /> The Himalayas is also considered to be the father of the river Ganges. The Mountain Kailash is a sacred peak to the Hindus and is where the Lord Shiva is believed to live (Admin, sec. Centre of Religion).<ref name=":3" /> Two of the most sacred places of pilgrimage for the Hindus is the temple complex in Pashupatinath and Muktinath, also known as Saligrama because of the presence of the sacred black rocks called saligrams (Zurick, Julsun, Basanta, and Birendra, 153).<ref name=JEE/>

The Buddhists also lay a great deal of importance on the mountains of the Himalayas. Paro Taktsang is the holy place where Buddhism started in Bhutan (Admin, sec. Centre of Religion).<ref name=":3" /> The Muktinath is also a place of pilgrimage for the Tibetan Buddhists. They believe that the trees in the poplar grove came from the walking sticks of eighty-four ancient Indian Buddhist magicians or ''mahasiddhas''. They consider the saligrams to be representatives of the Tibetan serpent deity known as Gawo Jagpa (Zurick, Julsun, Basanta, and Birendra, 153).<ref name=":4">Zurick, David, Julsun Pacheco, Basanta Raj. Shrestha, and Birendra Bajracharya. Illustrated Atlas of the Himalaya. Lexington: U of Kentucky, 2006. Google Books. The University Press of Kentucky. Web. 11 Nov. 2015.</ref>

The Himalayan people’s diversity shows in many different ways. It shows through their architecture, their languages and dialects, their beliefs and rituals, as well as their clothing (Zurick, Julsun, Basanta, and Birendra, 78).<ref name=":4" /> The shapes and materials of the people’s homes reflect their practical needs and the beliefs. Another example of the diversity amongst the Himalayan peoples is that handwoven textiles display unique colors and patterns that coincide with their ethnic backgrounds. Finally, some people place a great importance on jewelry. The Rai and Limbu women wear big gold earrings and nose rings to show their wealth through their jewelry (Zurick, Julsun, Basanta, and Birendra, 79).<ref name=":4" />
