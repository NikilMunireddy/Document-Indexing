A '''hardcover''', '''hardback''', or '''hardbound''' [[book]] is one [[bookbinding|bound]] with rigid protective covers (typically of [[Binder's board|cardboard]] covered with [[buckram]] or other [[cloth]], heavy [[paper]], or occasionally [[Calf-binding|leather]]). It has a flexible, sewn spine which allows the book to lie flat on a surface when opened. Following the [[ISBN]] sequence numbers, books of this type may be identified by the abbreviation ''Hbk''.

Hardcover books are often printed on [[acid-free paper]], and are much more durable than [[paperback]]s, which have flexible, easily damaged paper covers.  Hardcover books are marginally more costly to manufacture.  Hardcovers are frequently protected by artistic [[dust jacket]]s, but a "jacketless" alternative is becoming increasingly popular: these "paper-over-board" or "jacketless hardcover" bindings forgo the dust jacket in favor of printing the cover design directly onto the board binding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://publishingperspectives.com/2009/06/in-praise-of-paper-over-board/ |title=In Praise of Paper-Over-Board |publisher=Publishing Perspectives |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Neyfakh |first=Leon |url=http://www.observer.com/2009/08/the-new-thing-books-without-jackets/ |title=The New Thing: Books Without Jackets |publisher=Observer |date= |accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref>

==Marketing==
If brisk sales are anticipated, a hardcover edition of a book is typically released first, followed by a "trade" [[paperback]] edition (same format as hardcover) the next year. Some publishers publish paperback originals if slow hardback sales are anticipated. For very popular books these sales cycles may be extended, and followed by a [[mass market paperback]] edition [[typeset]] in a more compact size and printed on shallower,{{clarify|date=March 2015}} less hardy paper. This is intended to, in part, prolong the life of the immediate buying boom that occurs for some best sellers: After the attention to the book has subsided, a lower-cost version in the paperback, is released to sell further copies. In the past the release of a paperback edition  was one year after the hardback, but by the early twenty-first century paperbacks were released six months after the hardback by some publishers.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/books/e-books-accelerate-paperback-publishers-release-dates.html?_r=0</ref> It is very unusual for a book that was first published in paperback to be followed by a hardback. An example is the novel ''The Judgment of Paris'' by [[Gore Vidal]], which had its revised edition of 1961 first published in [[paperback]], and later in hardcover.<ref>http://www.pitt.edu/~kloman/early.html</ref>

==Prices==
Hardcover books are usually sold at higher prices than comparable paperbacks. Books for the general public are usually printed in hardback only for authors who are expected to be successful, or as a precursor to the paperback to predict sale levels; however, many academic books are often only published in hardcover editions.

==Typical structure==

Hardcovers typically consist of a page block, two boards, and a cloth or heavy paper covering. The pages are sewn together and glued onto a flexible spine between the boards, and it too is covered by the cloth. A paper wrapper, or dust jacket, is usually put over the binding, folding over each horizontal end of the boards. On the folded part, or flap, over the front cover is generally a [[blurb]], or a summary of the book. The back flap is where the [[biography]] of the author can be found. Reviews are often placed on the back of the jacket.
