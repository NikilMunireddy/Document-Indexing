'''County Meath''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|iː|ð}} {{respell|MEEDH|'}}; {{lang-gle|Contae na Mí}} or simply {{lang|ga|''an Mhí''}}) is a [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Leinster]] and is part of the [[Mid-East Region, Ireland|Mid-East Region]]. It is named after the historic [[Kingdom of Meath]] (from ''{{lang|ga|Midhe}}'' meaning "middle").  [[Meath County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county. The population of the county is 184,135 according to the 2011 census.<ref>[http://census.cso.ie/sapmap2011/Results.aspx?Geog_Type=CTY&Geog_Code=11&CTY=11 Census 2011 - County Meath Overview]</ref>

==Geography and political subdivisions==
The county is drained by the [[River Boyne]].

Meath is the 14th largest of Ireland’s 32 counties in area and 9th largest in terms of population.<ref>{{cite book| first=Eoghan| last=Corry| title=The GAA Book of Lists| publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland| year=2005| id= | pages=186–191| isbn=0-340-89695-7}}</ref> It is the second largest of Leinster’s 12 counties in size and third largest in terms of population. The [[county town]] is [[Navan]], where the county hall and government are located, although [[Trim, County Meath|Trim]], the former county town, has historical significance and remains a sitting place of the [[courts of the Republic of Ireland|circuit court]]. County Meath also has the only two [[Gaeltacht]] areas in the province of Leinster, at [[Ráth Cairn]] and Baile Ghib.

===Baronies===
There are eighteen historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in the county.<ref>[http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Slane+Upper&streets=no Placenames Database of Ireland] - Baronies.</ref> They include the baronies of [[Morgallion]] and [[Ratoath (barony)|Ratoath]]. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed under "Administrative units".

===Local government and politics===
{{main|Meath County Council}}

There are 40 elected members in Meath County Council. [[Fine Gael]] hold 13 seats, [[Fianna Fáil]] hold 10, [[Sinn Féin]] hold 8, and there are 9 independents. There are 2 Dáil constituencies, [[Meath West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Meath West]] and [[Meath East (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Meath East]]. Before, there was only one constituency. [[Fianna Fáil]] has held three seats out of five in the [[Meath (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Meath constituency]] since 1987, [[Fine Gael]] has won the other two seats at each in four of the five general elections in that period, with the exception of 1992, when it lost a seat to the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] party (which was regained in 1997). The two current constituencies are within the borders of the county. The constituencies also include part of the neighbouring county of [[County Westmeath|Westmeath]]. Together they return 6 deputies to [[Dáil Éireann]]. Part of the county along the [[Irish Sea]] coast, known as [[East Meath]] which includes [[Julianstown]] and [[Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington]] are part of the [[Louth (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Louth]] constituency for general elections. [[Fianna Fáil]] currently hold no seats, [[Fine Gael]] have 2 in each constituency, [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] has 1 in the East constituency and [[Sinn Féin]] have 1 in the West constituency.

==History==
The county is colloquially known by the nickname "The Royal County" due to its history as the seat of the [[High King of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Meath - a rich and royal land | url = http://www.meath.ie/Tourism/Heritage/ | accessdate = 21 May 2010 | author = Meath County Council }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = County Meath - Newgrange, Slane Castle and the Book of Kells | url = http://www.countymeath.com/ | accessdate = 21 May 2010 | author = countymeath.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1= Rowan Kelleher |first1= Suzanne |title= Frommer's Ireland from $80 a Day |accessdate= 21 May 2010 | edition = 20th |year= 2004 |publisher= Wiley Publishing, Inc |location= Hoboken, New Jersey, USA |isbn= 0-7645-4217-6 |page= 204 }}</ref> It formed from the eastern part of the former [[Kingdom of Mide]] (see [[Kings of Mide]]) but now forms part of the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Leinster]]. Historically, the kingdom and its successor territory the [[Lordship of Meath]], included all of counties Meath, [[Fingal]] and [[County Westmeath|Westmeath]] as well as parts of counties [[County Cavan|Cavan]], [[County Longford|Longford]], [[County Louth|Louth]], [[County Offaly|Offaly]] and [[County Kildare|Kildare]]. The seat of the High King of Ireland was at [[Hill of Tara|Tara]]. The archaeological complex of ''[[Brú na Bóinne]]'' is 5,000 years old and includes the burial sites of [[Newgrange]], [[Knowth]] and [[Dowth]], in the north-east of the county. It is a [[UNESCO]] designated [[World Heritage Site]].

==Demographics==
[[File:Population of County Meath (graph).PNG|thumb|right|Graph showing the population change in Co. Meath.]]
The population in Co. Meath has been characterised since 1861 as being in a period of significant decline. Between 1861 and 1901 the population  almost halved (110,373 to 67,497); the population stabilised from 1901 to 1971 (67,497 to 71,729) and there was a substantial increase between 1971 and 1981 to 95,419. This increase was mainly due to a baby boom locally. The population continued to increase at a constant rate, before increasing at an explosive rate between 1996 and 2002, from 109,732 to 134,005. This is due primarily to economic factors, with the return of residents to live in the county, and also an echo effect of the 70s baby boom. The census of 2011 gives a statistic of 184,135 to include a dramatic increase in inward migration in the county, much of it from neighbouring [[Dublin]], and [[Drogheda]].

This population growth has seen divergent trends emerge in recent years, with mild depopulation in the north and west of the county being more than offset by large increases in the population of the eastern and south eastern part of the county, principally due to inward migration to districts that have good proximity via road to the business parks on the Western outskirts of [[Dublin]]. The accession of [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] to the [[European Union]] in 2004 resulted in a significant influx of workers from these countries to work in low wage sectors, including agriculture, quarrying, construction and catering.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Economy==
[[File:Newgrange ireland 750px.jpg|220px|thumbnail|[[Newgrange]]]]
* Good land, with a strong farming tradition has been prominent historically for [[cattle]], [[dairy farming|dairying]], [[potato]]es and [[cereal|grain]]. Recently production volumes have decreased due to competition for labour from other sectors of the economy. Migrant labour from Eastern Europe has helped however. Meath is Ireland's leading county producer of potatoes, and a significant producer of beef, barley, milk, wheat, and root vegetables.
* Quarrying and Mining.  Europe's largest underground lead-zinc mine, Tara Mines, has operated since 1977, at a location to the west of Navan. Current ore production from the mine is 2,600,000 tonnes of ore per year, containing over 200,000 tonnes of zinc metal.  Glacial deposits of gravel exist in a band stretching from the Offaly border at Edenderry, to the sea at Laytown. This is the basis of a long running quarrying tradition. A large cement plant near [[Duleek]] is situated in this territory.
* An increasing proportion of Meath residents commute into [[Dublin]], with a resulting shift to a [[service economy|services based economy]] in the developing [[Commuter town|dormitory town]]s.
* Meat processing in Clonee, and Navan.
* Historically Navan was a manufacturing town, involved in the household goods sector. Navan was the centre of the Irish Furniture industry. Gradually this has declined as a source of employment, though it has acted as a source of inspiration for other ventures producing finished products for the construction industry.
* Navan was the centre of the Irish Carpet making industry, before this was lost to overseas competition.
* Horse breeding and training.
* Localized tourism in Trim, Kells, Tara and the Boyne Valley.
* In common with other counties with thriving agricultural and traditional local industrial sectors like Westmeath, Wexford, Kilkenny and Monaghan. Meath has few multinational investment facilities. Drogheda, Blanchardstown, Swords, and Leixlip are neighbouring towns that provide employment to multinational investment facilities.

==Transport==

* [[Laytown railway station|Laytown]] has a frequent commuter service. The station is located on Dublin's '[[Dublin Suburban Rail#Northern Commuter|Northern Commuter Line]]'
* There is a commuter train service ([[Dublin Suburban Rail#Western Commuter|Western Commuter Line]]) from [[Enfield (County Meath) railway station|Enfield]]. Although the service is very infrequent (only 8 trains a day to Dublin with no direct trains 4 pm - 9 pm), not many villages like Enfield have a commuter service at all.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* [[Navan railway station|Navan]] is currently served by a freight only spur railway line from [[Drogheda railway station|Drogheda]] the on the [[Belfast-Dublin railway line|Dublin-Belfast main line]], for freight traffic (zinc and lead concentrates from Tara Mines in Navan to Dublin Port) connecting at [[Drogheda]]. The [[Dublin–Navan railway line|direct rail line]] remains abandoned, though its path is reasonably intact, and plans are drawn up to reopen it in line with current government transport policy. However, this plan has now been put on hold due to the economic downturn.
