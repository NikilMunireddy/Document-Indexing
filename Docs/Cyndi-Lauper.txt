==Life and career==

===1953–1979: Early life===

Lauper was born at Boulevard Hospital in [[Astoria, Queens]], [[New York City]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Hoffman, Jan| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E06E2D7113EF932A05751C1A9659C8B63 |title=PUBLIC LIVES; She Just Wanted to Have Fun.

In the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various [[cover band]]s. One was called Flyer in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including [[Bad Company]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. Although Lauper was performing on stage, she was not happy singing [[cover version|cover]]s.<ref>{{Cite web

===1980–1982: ''Blue Angel''===

In 1978, Lauper met saxophone player [[John Turi]] through her manager Ted Rosenblatt. Turi and Lauper formed a band named ''Blue Angel'' and recorded a demo tape of original music.

Lauper received recording offers as a solo artist, but held out, wanting the band to be included in any deal she made. Blue Angel was eventually signed by [[Polydor Records]] and released a self-titled album on the label in 1980. Lauper hated the album cover, saying that it made her look like [[Big Bird]], but ''Rolling Stone'' magazine later included it as one of the 100 best [[New wave music|new wave]] album covers (2003). Despite critical acclaim, the album sold poorly (or "It went lead", as Lauper later joked.) and the band broke up. The members of Blue Angel had a falling out with Massarsky and fired him as their manager. He later filed an $80,000 suit against them, which forced Lauper into bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/lauper_cyndi/artist.jhtml|title=Cyndi Lauper|publisher=MTV|accessdate=March 1, 2010}}</ref> After this Lauper temporarily lost her voice due to an inverted cyst in her vocal cord.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news|first=David|last=Chiu |url=http://time.com/65952/cyndi-lauper-shes-so-unusual/ |title=Cyndi Lauper's She's So Unusual Is 30: New Tour With Cher, Kinky Boots |work=TIME |date= |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

After Blue Angel broke up and due to her financial problems, Lauper spent time working in retail stores, waitressing at [[IHOP]] (which she quit after being demoted to hostess when the manager made a pass at her),<ref name="WETV"/> and singing in local clubs. Her most frequent gigs were at El Sombrero.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> Music critics who saw Lauper perform with Blue Angel believed she had star potential due to her four-octave singing range,<ref>Jerome, Jim.

===1983–1985: ''She's So Unusual''===
{{Main|She's So Unusual}}
On October 14, 1983, Lauper released her first solo album, ''[[She's So Unusual]]''. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;4 in the US, and became a worldwide hit. The primary studio musicians were [[Eric Bazilian]] and [[Rob Hyman]] (of [[The Hooters]]), [[Rick Chertoff]], [[Richard Termini]] and Peter Wood. Lauper became popular with teenagers and critics, in part due to her hybrid punk image which was crafted by stylist Patrick Lucas.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-02-08/news/vw-4846_1_freckles-show |title=Capturing Head-to-Toe Look of the '80s |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=February 8, 1985 |accessdate=October 15, 2011 |first=Mary |last=Rourke}}</ref>

Lauper was interested in writing her own songs, but the record company provided her with songs to record that were written by other writers. Lauper sometimes changed the lyrics in the material she was given by the record company; such is the case with "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]". Lauper found the original lyrics to be misogynistic, so she rewrote the song as an anthem for young women.<ref>{{cite news|first=Priya|last=Elan |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/sep/27/popandrock |title=Music: Priya Elan pays tribute to the man who wrote Girls Just Want To Have Fun |newspaper=The Guardian |date=September 27, 2008 |accessdate=October 15, 2011 |location=London}}</ref>

The album's second single "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]" was co-written by Lauper and Rob Hyman. "Time After Time" hit No.&nbsp;1 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and Adult Contemporary charts. The song would earn Lauper an [[Gold record|RIAA Gold certification]] for record sales that reached 500,000 copies.

The other [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles on ''She's So Unusual'' were "[[She Bop]]" (No.&nbsp;3), "[[All Through the Night (Cyndi Lauper song)|All Through the Night]]" (No.&nbsp;5), written by [[Jules Shear]] and "[[Money Changes Everything]]" (No.27).<ref>http://www.billboard.com, chart history, September 8, 1984, December 8, 1984, February 9, 1985</ref>

The album also includes two cover songs, [[The Brains]]' new wave track "[[Money Changes Everything]]" (No.27 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100) and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[When You Were Mine (Prince song)|When You Were Mine]]". The album made Lauper the first female to have four consecutive ''Billboard'' Hot 100 top five hits from one album. The LP stayed in the Top 200 charts for more than 65 weeks, and since has sold 22 million copies worldwide.<ref name="SSU Sales">{{cite web|first=Nick|last=Duerden |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/cyndi-lauper-interview-shes-still-having-fun-9235643.html |title=Cyndi Lauper interview: She's still having fun – Features – Music |newspaper=The Independent |date=April 4, 2014 |accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

''True Colors'' was not as commercially successful as ''She's So Unusual'', but it did contain three high-charting singles, including the title track, "[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|True Colors]]", which became Lauper's second song to hit No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100; "[[Change of Heart (Cyndi Lauper song)|Change of Heart]]" (No.&nbsp;3); and a cover of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s "[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]" (No.&nbsp;12).

==Activism==
[[File:Cyndi Lauper at Gay Games VII.jpg|thumb|200px|Lauper performing at the Gay Games VII, Wrigley Field, July 22, 2006]]
Lauper has been an LGBT rights supporter throughout her career, campaigning for equality through various charities and [[gay pride]] events around the world. Lauper stated that she became involved in gay rights advocacy because her sister Ellen is a lesbian and because Lauper herself was passionate about equality. Lauper cites her sister Ellen as a role model.<ref name=voice>{{cite web|url=http://thegavoice.com/cyndi-laupers-true-colors/|title=Cyndi Lauper’s ‘True Colors’|publisher=GA Voice|accessdate=January 23, 2016|date=July 23, 2010}}</ref>

Her song "Above the Clouds" celebrates the memory of [[Matthew Shepard]], a young man beaten to death in Wyoming because he was gay. As a member of the [[Matthew Shepard Foundation]] Board, Lauper devoted a [[concert tour]] in 2005 to promoting the Foundation's message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/entertainment-news/2005/12/14/cyndi-lauper-joins-honorary-board-matthew-shepard|title=Cyndi Lauper joins honorary board of Matthew Shepard Foundation|publisher=The Advocate|accessdate=January 23, 2016|date=December 14, 2005}}</ref>

She set up the ''True Colors Residence'' in New York City for LGBT homeless youths. The 30-bed facility offers temporary shelter and job placement help.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/cyndi-lauper-opens-shelter-for-homeless-lgbt-youth-20110825|title=Cyndi Lauper Opens Shelter for Homeless LGBT Youth |publisher=rollingstone.com |date=August 25, 2011 |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |first=Inae |last=Oh}}</ref>
