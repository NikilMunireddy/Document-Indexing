==History==
{{Main|History of Arizona State University}}
[[File:Pres. Theodore Roosevelt at Old Main of Arizona State University.jpg|thumb|left|President Theodore Roosevelt addresses a crowd of students on the steps of the Old Main at Tempe Normal School (future Arizona State University), March 20, 1911.]]

===1885–1929===
[[File:Arizona State University Old Main circa 1890.jpg|thumb|Old Main on the Tempe Normal School (future Arizona State University) campus, circa 1890]]

Arizona State University was established as the '''Territorial Normal School''' at Tempe on March 12, 1885, when the [[13th Arizona Territorial Legislature]] passed an act to create a [[normal school]] to train teachers for the [[Arizona Territory]]. The campus consisted of a single, four-room schoolhouse on a 20-acre plot largely donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson. Classes began with 33 students on February 8, 1886. The curriculum evolved over the years and the name was changed several times; the institution was also known as '''Arizona Territorial Normal School''' (1889–1896), '''Arizona Normal School ''' (1896–1899), '''Normal School of Arizona''' (1899–1901), and '''Tempe Normal School''' (1901–1925). The school accepted both high school students and graduates, and awarded high school diplomas and teaching certificates to those who completed the requirements.<ref name=TNS>{{cite web |url= http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/asu/tnsrec.xml |title= Tempe Normal School Records, 1885-1930 MSS-149 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year= 2014 |publisher= Arizona Archives Online |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Academicprograms">{{cite web |url= http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/acpro.htm |title= The New ASU Story: Academic Programs |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year= 2001 |publisher= Arizona State University |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Academicprograms"/><ref>[http://www.asu.edu/about/history/more.html History of ASU] Arizona State University</ref>

In 1923 the school stopped offering high school courses and added a high school diploma to the admissions requirements. In 1925 the school became the '''Tempe State Teachers College''' and offered four-year Bachelor of Education degrees as well as two-year teaching certificates. In 1929, the legislature authorized Bachelor of Arts in Education degrees as well, and the school was renamed the '''Arizona State Teachers College'''.<ref name=TNS/><ref name=Academicprograms/> Under the 30-year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still currently in use. Matthews envisioned an "evergreen campus," with many shrubs brought to the campus, and implemented the planting of [[Palm Walk]], now a landmark of the Tempe campus. His legacy is being continued to this day with the main campus having been declared a nationally recognized arboretum.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/fm/arboretum.htm The Arboretum at Arizona State University] ASU</ref>

During the [[Great Depression]], Ralph W. Swetman was hired as president for a three-year term.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/preslist.htm Archives & Special Collections, Principals and Presidents of Arizona State University] ASU</ref> Although enrollment increased by almost 100 percent during his tenure due to the depression, many faculty were terminated and faculty salaries were cut.<ref>"[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/11lead.htm Eighth President Ralph Waldo Swetman 1930–1933]" ASU</ref>

===1930–1989===
[[File:FLW Gammage Auditorium ASU PHX AZ 20186.JPG|thumb|ASU's [[Gammage Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]]]

In 1933, [[Grady Gammage]], then president of [[Northern Arizona University|Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff]], became president of ASU, a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years. Like his predecessor, Gammage oversaw construction of a number of buildings on the Tempe campus. He also oversaw the development of the university, graduate programs. The school's name was changed to '''Arizona State College''' in 1945, and finally to '''Arizona State University''' in 1958. At the time, two other names considered were '''Tempe University''' and '''State University at Tempe'''.<ref name="ASU50th">{{cite web|title=ASU's 50th Anniversary|url=https://asunow.asu.edu/content/asus-50th-anniversary|publisher=Arizona State University|accessdate=28 March 2016}}</ref>

By the 1960s, with the presidency of [[G. Homer Durham]], the University began to expand its academic curriculum by establishing several new colleges and beginning to award Doctor of Philosophy and other doctoral degrees.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/16lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership] ASU</ref>

The next three presidents—Harry K. Newburn, 1969–71, John W. Schwada, 1971–81, and J. Russell Nelson, 1981–89—and Interim President Richard Peck, 1989, led the university to increased academic stature, creation of the [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West campus]], and rising enrollment.

===1990–present===
Under the leadership of [[Lattie F. Coor]], president from 1990 to 2002, ASU grew through the creation of the [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic campus]] and extended education sites. Increased commitment to diversity, quality in [[undergraduate education]], research, and economic development occurred over his 12-year tenure. Part of Coor's legacy to the university was a successful fundraising campaign: through private donations, more than $500 million was invested in areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of [[Barrett, The Honors College]], and the [[Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts]]; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.<ref>[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/21lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership] ASU</ref>
[[File:Asubiodesign.jpg|thumb|ASU's [[Biodesign Institute]] on Tempe campus]]

In 2002, [[Michael M. Crow]] became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, he outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a "New American University"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newamericanuniversity.asu.edu/ |title=newamericanuniversity.asu.edu |publisher=newamericanuniversity.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> — one that would be open and inclusive, and set a goal for the university to meet [[Association of American Universities]] criteria and to become a member.<ref name="president.asu.edu"/> Crow initiated the idea of transforming ASU into "One university in many places" — a single institution comprising several campuses, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation. Subsequent reorganizations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asunews.asu.edu/20090121_reorg |title=Academic Reorganization |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced staff and administration as the university expanded its [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West]] and [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic]] campuses. ASU's [[Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus|Downtown Phoenix campus]] was also expanded, with several colleges and schools relocating there. The university established learning centers throughout the state, including the [[Colleges@ASU|ASU Colleges at Lake Havasu City]] and programs in Thatcher, Yuma, and Tucson. Students at these centers can choose from several ASU degree and certificate programs.

During Crow’s tenure, and aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU began a years-long research facility capital building effort, resulting in the establishment of the [[Biodesign Institute]] at Arizona State University, the [[ASU School of Sustainability|Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability]], and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of three [[Nobel Laureates]].<ref>[http://asunews.asu.edu/20091012_ostrom_nobel Nobel Prize Winners] ASU News</ref> Since 2002 the university's research expenditures have tripled and more than 1.5 million square feet of space has been added to the university's research facilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20121115_naustory |title=ASU's 'golden decade' and the rise of a New American University &#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=2012-11-16 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref>

The [[Great Recession|economic downturn]] that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget. In response to these cuts, ASU capped enrollment, closed down about four dozen academic programs, combined academic departments, consolidated colleges and schools, and reduced university faculty, staff and administrators;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asu.edu/budgetcuts |title=Fiscal Year 2009 state budget cuts force ASU to cap enrollment, freshman applications close March 1, five months early|publisher=Arizona State University Office of Public Affairs |accessdate=October 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2010/07/19/focus3.html |title=Examining how Arizona schools have coped with state budget cuts |publisher=Phoenix Business Journal |date=July 18, 2010}}</ref> however, with an economic recovery underway in 2011, the university continued its campaign to expand the West and Polytechnic Campuses,<ref>{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Lesley |url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2011/06/19/20110619asu-academic-villages.html |title=ASU Building Academic Villages |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2011-06-19 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> and establishing a set of low-cost, teaching-focused extension campuses in [[Lake Havasu City]] and [[Payson, Arizona]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url = http://havasu.asu.edu|title = Colleges at Lake Havasu|publisher = Arizona State University|accessdate = 2014-07-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20100928_payson |title=ASU, Town of Payson to assess higher ed possibilities |publisher=Arizona State University |date=September 28, 2010 }}</ref>

In 2015, the existing [[Thunderbird School of Global Management]] became the fifth ASU campus, as the Thunderbird School of Global Management at ASU. Partnerships for education and research with [[Mayo Clinic]] established collaborative degree programs in health care and law, and shared administrator positions, laboratories and classes at the Mayo Clinic Arizona campus.

The Arizona Center for Law and Society, the new home of ASU’s [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]], will open in fall 2016 on the Downtown Phoenix campus, relocating faculty and students from the Tempe campus to the state capital.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scott |first=Eugene |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/20121108asu-eyes-2016-phoenix-move-law-school.html#protected |title=ASU eyes 2016 Phoenix move for law school |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2012-11-08 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref>

{{Main|Arizona Board of Regents}}

The Arizona Board of Regents governs Arizona State University as well as the state's other public universities; [[University of Arizona]] and [[Northern Arizona University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azregents.edu/universities/arizonastateuniversity/default.aspx |title=Arizona State University |publisher=Azregents.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The Board of Regents is composed of twelve members including eleven voting, and one non-voting member. Members of the board include the Governor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction acting as ex-officio members, eight volunteer Regent members with eight years term that are appointed by the Governor, and two Student Regents with two years term, serving a one-year term as non-voting apprentices. [[Arizona Board of Regents|ABOR]] provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona. ASU has five campuses in metropolitan [[Phoenix, Arizona]] including the Tempe campus in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]; the West campus and the Thunderbird School of Global Management in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]]; the Downtown Phoenix campus; and the Polytechnic campus in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]]. ASU also offers courses and degrees through ASU Online and at the ASU Colleges at [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona|Lake Havasu City]] in western Arizona, and offers regional learning programs in Thatcher, Yuma and Tucson.

The Arizona Board of Regents appoints and elects the president of the university, who is considered the chief executive officer and the chief budget officer of the institution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd102.html |title=Arizona State University |publisher=Asu.edu |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The president is responsible for the execution of measures enacted by the Board of Regents, controls the property of the university, and acts as the official representative of the university to the Board of Regents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azregents.edu/policymanual/default.aspx |title=Policy Manual |publisher=Azregents.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The chief executive officer is assisted through the administration of the institution by the provost, vice presidents, deans, faculty, directors, department chairs, and other officers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/admin/ |title=ASU Leadership |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The president also selects and appoints administrative officers and general counsels.

==Campuses and locations==
ASU's academic programs are spread across campuses in the [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area]]; however, unlike most multi-campus institutions, ASU describes itself as "one university in many places," inferring that there is "not a system with separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses."<ref>[http://campus.asu.edu One University in Many Places] Arizona State University</ref> The university considers each campus "distinctive" and academically focused on certain aspects of the overall university mission. The Tempe Campus is the university's research and graduate school center. Undergraduate studies on the Tempe campus are research-based programs designed to prepare students for graduate school, professional school, or employment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Virtual TourParkingCampus Map |url=http://campus.asu.edu/tempe |title=Arizona State University |publisher=Campus.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The Polytechnic campus is designed with an emphasis on professional and technological programs for direct workforce preparation.

Inter-campus shuttles and [[light rail]] allow students and faculty to easily travel between the campuses. In addition to the physical campuses, ASU's "virtual campus", housed at the university's [[Skysong, the ASU Scottsdale Innovation Center|SkySong Innovation Center]], provides [[online education|online]] and extended education.

{{Main|Arizona State University Tempe campus}}

The university's mascot is not to be confused with the university’s new emblem and logo, The [[Trident]], colloquially referred to as the ''fork'' or the ''pitchfork,'' which is a hand gesture used by those associated with the university. The new logo and emblem are used on various university property, sport facilities, uniforms and documents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arizona.sbnation.com/arizona-st-sun-devils/2011/4/12/2106994/arizona-state-university-asu-sun-devils-to-unveil-new-uniforms-colors-logo-etc |title=ASU's Uniforms And Logos Set To Make Debut: Consider The Fork, Feared - SB Nation Arizona |publisher=Arizona.sbnation.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> Arizona State Teacher’s College had a different mascot and the sports teams were known as the Owls and later, the Bulldogs. When the school was first established, the Tempe Normal School’s teams were simply known as the Normals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.territorialcupseries.com/genrel/history.html |title=State Farm Territorial Cup Series |publisher=Territorialcupseries.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> Sparky is visible on the sidelines of every home game played in [[Sun Devil Stadium]] or other ASU athletic facilities. His routine at football games includes pushups after every touchdown scored by the Sun Devils. He is aided by Sparky's Crew, male yell leaders that must meet physical requirements in order to participate as members. The female members are known as the Spirit Squad and are categorized into a dance line and spirit line. They are the official squad that represents ASU. The spirit squad competes every year at the ESPN Universal Dance Association (UDA) College Nationals in the Jazz and Hip-Hop categories. They were chosen by the UDA to represent the USA at the World Dance Championship 2013 in the Jazz category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundevils.com/genrel/asu-cheer-intro.html |title=Arizona State University Official Athletic Site - Athletics News - Arizona State Sun Devils |publisher=Thesundevils.com |date=2014-04-03 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> Currently, ASU's varsity intercollegiate [[cheerleading]] team is not allowed to participate at athletic events (e.g. football and basketball games) due to dismissal regarding prior misconduct.<ref>[http://sundevilcheerleaders.webs.com/ourpurpose.htm ] {{wayback|url=http://sundevilcheerleaders.webs.com/ourpurpose.htm |date=20121120000617 }}</ref> ASU Cheerleading has since become a club sport, through the Student Recreation Center, competing locally and nationally as a Collegiate Co-Ed Division IA-Level VI team.

==="A" Mountain===
{{Main|Tempe Butte}}
A letter has existed on the slope of the mountain since 1918. A "T" followed by an "N" were the first letters to grace the landmark. [[Tempe Butte]], home to "A" Mountain, has had the "A" installed on the slope of its south face since 1938 and is visible from campus just to the south. The original "A" was destroyed by vandals in 1952 with pipe bombs and a new "A", constructed of reinforced concrete, was built in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/tour/tempe/amtn.html |title=ASU Tempe Campus Tour: "A" Mountain |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The vandals were never identified but many speculate that the conspirators were students from the rival in-state university (University of Arizona). Many ancient [[Hohokam]] [[petroglyph]]s were destroyed by the bomb; nevertheless, many of these archeological sites around the mountain remain. There are many traditions surrounding "A" Mountain, including a revived "guarding of the 'A'" in which students camp on the mountainside before games with rival schools.<ref name="abc15">{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_southeast_valley/tempe/asu-students-guarding-'a'-mountain-from-wildcat-faithful|title=ASU students guarding 'A' mountain from Wildcat faithful|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}</ref> "Whitewashing" of the "A" is a tradition in which incoming freshmen paint the letter white during orientation week and is repainted gold before the first football game of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.asu.edu/groups/students/saa/events/whitewash |title=Whitewash the "A" &#124; ASU Alumni Association |publisher=Alumni.asu.edu |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> Whitewashing dates back to the 1930s and it grows in popularity every year, with thousands of students going up to paint the "A" every year.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Carelessness, painting of the 'A', vandalism take a toll on mountain|url = http://www.azcentral.com/community/tempe/articles/20110820tempe-hayden-butte-a-mountain-toll.html|website = azcentral.com|access-date = 2016-02-02}}</ref>

[[File:Lantern Walk.jpg|thumb|Old newspaper clipping describing the Lantern Walk tradition at ASU, May 30, 1929]]

===Lantern Walk and Homecoming===
The Lantern Walk is one of the oldest traditions at ASU and dates back to 1917.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.asu.edu/groups/students/saa/events/lantern-walk |title=Lantern Walk &#124; ASU Alumni Association |publisher=Alumni.asu.edu |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> It is considered one of ASU’s "most cherished" traditions and is an occasion used to mark the work of those associated with ASU throughout history. Anyone associated with ASU is free to participate in the event, including students, alumni, faculty, employees, and friends. This differs slightly from the original tradition in which the seniors would carry lanterns up "A" Mountain followed by the freshman. The senior class president would describe ASU's traditions and the freshman would repeat an oath of allegiance to the university. It was described as a tradition of "good will between the classes" and a way of ensuring new students would continue the university's traditions with honor. In modern times, the participants walk through campus and follow a path up to "A" Mountain in order to "light up" Tempe. Keynote speakers, performances, and other events are used to mark the occasion. The night is culminated with a fireworks display. The Lantern Walk was held after the Spring Semester (June) but is now held the week before [[Homecoming]], a tradition that dates back to 1924 at ASU. It is held in the fall and in conjunction with a football game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homecoming.asu.edu/ |title=ASU homecoming &#124; ASU Homecoming |publisher=Homecoming.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref>

===Victory Bell===
Arizona State University reintroduced the tradition of ringing a bell after each win for the football team in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20121119_victorybell |title=Sun Devil Athletics brings back Victory Bell in return to tradition &#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=2012-11-19 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The ROTC cadets associated with the university are responsible for the transportation of the bell to various events and for ringing the bell after games are won by the Sun Devils. The first Victory Bell, in various forms, was used in the 1930s but the tradition faded in the 1970s when the bell in use was removed from Memorial Union for renovations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/30casc.htm |title=ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Campus Lives - Campus Scenes |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The bell cracked and was no longer capable of ringing. That bell is located on the southeast corner of Sun Devil Stadium near the entrance to the student section. That bell, given to the university in the late 1960s, is painted gold and is a campus landmark today.

===Sun Devil Marching Band, Devil Walk and Songs of the University===
{{Main|Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band}}
[[Sun devil marching band|The Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band]], created in 1915 and known as the ''Pride of the Southwest'', was the first of only two [[marching band]]s in the Pac-12 to be awarded the prestigious [[Sudler trophy#The Sudler Trophy|Sudler Trophy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sousafoundation.net/Default.aspx?ID=39 |title=The John Philip Sousa Foundation |publisher=Sousafoundation.net |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The John Philip Sousa Foundation awarded the band the trophy in 1991. The Sun Devil Marching Band remains one of only 28 bands in the nation to have earned the designation. The band performs at every football game played in Sun Devil Stadium. In addition, the Sun Devil Marching Band has made appearances in the Fiesta Bowl, the Rose Bowl, the Holiday Bowl, and the Super Bowl XLII, in addition to many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sundevilband.asu.edu/history|title=Athletic Bands: History|publisher=Arizona State University|accessdate=2016-02-12}}</ref> Smaller ensembles of band members perform at other sport venues including basketball games at Wells Fargo Arena and baseball games. The Devil Walk is held in Wells Fargo Arena by the football team and involves a more formal introduction of the players to the community; a new approach to the tradition added in 2012 with the arrival of [[head coach]] Todd Graham.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arizonasports.com/44/1571028/ASUs-Newest-Tradtion-The-Devil-Walk |title=ASU's Newest Tradition: The Devil Walk |publisher=Arizonasports.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> It begins 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the game and allows the players to establish rapport with the fans. The walk ends as the team passes the band and fans lined along the path to Sun Devil Stadium. The most recognizable songs played by the band are ''Alma Mater'' and ASU’s [[fight songs]] titled ''[[Maroon and gold|Maroon and Gold]]'' and the ''Al Davis Fight Song''. ''Alma Mater'' was composed by former Music Professor and Director of Sun Devil Marching Band (then known as Bulldog Marching Band), Miles A. Dresskell, in 1937.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alumni.asu.edu/remember/traditions-arizona-state-university/songs |title=Songs &#124; ASU Alumni Association |publisher=Alumni.asu.edu |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> ''Maroon and Gold'' was authored by former Director of Sun Devil Marching Band, Felix E. McKernan, in 1948. The ''Al Davis Fight Song'' (also known as ''Go, Go Sun Devils'' and ''Arizona State University Fight Song'') was composed by ASU alumnus Albert Oliver Davis in the 1940s without any lyrics. Recently lyrics were added to the song.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/history/tradition.php |title=Tradition &#124; Sun Devil Athletic Bands &#124; School of Music &#124; ASU Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts |publisher=Music.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref>

Arizona State University has an active [[extracurricular]] involvement program (Sun Devil Involvement Center).<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/mu/clubs/|title = Memorial Union – Student Organizations|publisher = Asu.edu|date = |accessdate = 2014-07-08}}</ref> Located on the 3rd floor of the Memorial Union,<ref name="asu13">{{cite web |url=http://more.engineering.asu.edu/grad/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/memorial-union.png|title=grad/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/memorial-union |publisher=more.engineering.asu.edu|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}</ref> the Sun Devil Involvement Center (SDIC) provides opportunities for student involvement through clubs, [[sororities]], [[fraternities]], [[community service]], leadership, [[student government]], and [[Co-curricular activity|co-curricular]] programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/tour/tempe/mu.html |title=ASU Tempe Campus Tour: Memorial Union |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref>

Changemaker Central is student-run centralized resource hub for student involvement in [[social entrepreneurship]], [[civic engagement]], [[service learning]] and [[community service]] that catalyzes student-driven social change. Changemaker Central locations have opened on all campuses in fall 2011, providing flexible, creative workspaces for everyone in the ASU community. The project is entirely student run and advances ASU’s institutional commitments to social embeddedness and entrepreneurship. The space allows students to meet, work and join new networks and collaborative enterprises while taking advantage of ASU’s many resources and opportunities for engagement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://changemaker.asu.edu/ |title=Changemaker @ ASU |publisher=Changemaker.asu.edu |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> Changemaker Central has signature programs, including Innovation Challenge and 10,000 Solutions, that support students in their journey to become changemakers by creating communities of support around new solutions/ideas and increasing access to early stage seed funding.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://changemaker.asu.edu/about.php#2 |title=Changemaker @ ASU |publisher=Changemaker.asu.edu |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref> The Innovation Challenge seeks undergraduate and graduate students from across the university who are dedicated to making a difference in our local and global communities through innovation.

In addition to Changemaker Central, the Freshman Year Residential Experience (FYRE) and the [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek]] community (Greek Life) at Arizona State University have been important in binding students to the university, and providing social outlets. The Freshman Year Residential Experience at Arizona State University was developed to improve the freshman experience at Arizona State University and increase student retention figures. FYRE provides advising, computer labs, free walk-in tutoring, workshops, and classes for students. ASU is also home to one of the nation's first and fastest growing gay fraternities, [[Sigma Phi Beta]], founded in 2003;<ref name="statepress">{{cite web|url=http://www.statepress.com/2010/11/15/asu-gay-fraternity-expands-to-indiana-university/|title=ASU gay fraternity expands to Indiana University &#124; ASU News &#124; The State Press &#124; Arizona State University|publisher=statepress.com|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}</ref> considered a sign of the growing university's commitment to supporting diversity and inclusion.

The second Eta chapter of [[Phrateres]], a non-exclusive, non-profit social-service club, was installed here in 1958.

There are multiple councils for Greek Life, including the Interfraternity Council (IFC), Multicultural Greek Organization (MCG), National Association of Latino and Fraternal Organizations (NALFO), National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC), Panhellenic Association (PHA), and the Professional Fraternity Council (PFC).

===Student media===
''The [[State Press]]'' is the university's independent, student-operated news publication. The State Press covers news and events on all four ASU campuses. Student editors and managers are solely responsible for the content of the State Press website. These publications are overseen by an independent board and guided by a professional adviser employed by the University.

''The Downtown Devil'' is a student-run news publication website for the Downtown Phoenix Campus, produced by students at the [[Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://downtowndevil.com/ |title=Downtown Phoenix News |publisher=Downtown Devil |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}</ref>

ASU has two radio stations. [[KASC (AM)|KASC]] The Blaze 1330&nbsp;AM, is a broadcast station that is owned and funded by the Cronkite School of Journalism, and is completely student-run save for a faculty and professional adviser. The Blaze broadcasts local, alternative and independent music 24 hours a day, and also features news and sports updates at the top and bottom of every hour.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.blazeradioonline.com/|title = kasc – the blaze 1330 am – asu's original alternative|publisher = Blazeradioonline.com|date = |accessdate = 2014-07-08}}</ref> W7ASU is an [[amateur radio]] station that was first organized in 1935.

===Student government===
Associated Students of Arizona State University (ASASU) is the [[student government]] at Arizona State University.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://eoss.asu.edu/studentgov|title = Student Government|publisher = |accessdate = 27 January 2016}}</ref> It is composed of the Undergraduate Student Government and the Graduate & Professional Student Association (GPSA). Members and officers of ASASU are elected annually by the student body.

The [[Residence Hall Association]] (RHA) of Arizona State University is the student government for every ASU student living on-campus. Each ASU campus has an RHA that operates independently of each other. The purpose of RHA is to enhance the quality of residence hall life and provide a cohesive voice for the residents by addressing the concerns of the on-campus populations to university administrators and other campus organizations; providing cultural, diversity, educational, and social programming; establishing and working with individual community councils.

===On-campus living===
Arizona State University offers on-campus living arrangements on all three campuses. On the main [[Arizona State University Tempe campus|Tempe campus]] it includes dorms such as Palo Verde East, Palo Verde West, Palo Verde Main (under construction), University Towers, Arcadia, Manzanita, Hassayampa Academic Village, San Pablo (otherwise known as "CLAS Academy"),<ref>{{Cite web|title = University Housing|url =http://housing.asu.edu/residence/san-pablo|website=housing,asu.edu|access-date = 2016-01-31}}</ref>  the Sonora Center, and multiple [[Barrett, The Honors College|Barrett]] dorms.<ref>{{Cite web|title = University Housing|url = https://housing.asu.edu/residential-colleges|website = housing.asu.edu|access-date = 2016-01-26}}</ref> Recently, ASU has added Vista Del Sol on Apache road to the on campus living for upper class honors college students. Coming Fall 2017, the new Palo Verde Main will be completed. Each dormitory is identified with a specific college, institute, major, or sport, and are relatively close to all the classes the student would be taking according to their major (excluding the Sonora Center which is meant to house 'overflow' students that do not fit in the other dormatory complexes, as well as students who have declared their major as 'exploratory'). For example, University Towers is strictly all Engineering students. Aside from the on-campus dorms, Arizona State also offers residential halls for upper-division housing and Greek life housing.Greek Life housing is only available for sororities that are current members of ASU Panhellenic. There are currently 12 sororities residing in Greek life housing. Sororities are housed in a gated complex called Adelphi Commons and it is only accessible to members of the sororities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Adelphi Commons I  {{!}} University Housing|url = https://housing.asu.edu/residence/adelphi-commons-i|website = housing.asu.edu|access-date = 2016-02-01}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Sexual assault investigation===
On May 1, 2014, ASU was listed as one of [[U.S. Department of Education Releases List of Higher Education Institutions with Open Title IX Sexual Violence Investigations|fifty five higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights]] "for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints" by Barack Obama's White House Task Force To Protect Students from Sexual Assault.<ref>{{cite news|title=ASU among schools in US federal sex assault probe|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/may/1/asu-among-schools-in-us-federal-sex-assault-probe/|accessdate=18 September 2014|work=The Washington Times|agency=Associated Press|date=1 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=EDAnnounce>{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Education Releases List of Higher Education Institutions with Open Title IX Sexual Violence Investigations|url=http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-releases-list-higher-education-institutions-open-title-i|website=U.S. Department of Education|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> The publicly announced investigation followed two Title IX suits.<ref name="two previous suits">{{cite web|last1=Ryman|first1=Anne|title=ASU settled at least two previous sexual-violence suits |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2014/05/01/arizona-state-universities-sex-assault-inquiry/8565811/|website=Arizona Central|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref> In July 2014, a group of at least nine current and former students who alleged that they were harassed or assaulted asked that the federal investigation be expanded.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ryman|first1=Anne|title=Feds: ASU sex-assault probe ongoing|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2014/07/10/asu-students-ask-feds-broaden-sexual-assault-probe/12491247/ |accessdate=18 September 2014|work=The Arizona Republic|publisher=Gannett|date=10 July 2014}}</ref>
In August 2014 ASU President Michael Crow appointed a task force<ref>{{cite web|title=ASU wants campus 'free from threat of sexual violence' |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2014/08/22/asu-wants-campus-free-threat-sexual-violence/14445703|website=azcentral.com|publisher=Gannett|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref> comprising faculty and staff, students, and members of the university police force to review the university’s efforts to address sexual violence.

===Faculty Plagiarism===
In 2011, Professor Matthew Whitaker was accused of plagiarizing material in six books he had written, as well as in a speech he made to local high school students.  After watching a video of the speech, a plagiarism analyst said he could pretty much read along from a newspaper article as Whitaker spoke.  To the intense consternation of ASU faculty members (the chairman of the tenure committee resigned in protest) an investigating committee concluded there was no pattern of deceit and that the copying had been inadvertent.  It all popped up again in 2014 with another Whitaker book, “Peace Be Still: Modern Black America From World War II to Barack Obama.”  A blogger writing under an apparent pseudonym set out side-by-side excerpts from Whitaker’s book and material available on the Web at sites like infoplease.com and the Archive of American Television.  They are more than just similar in tone.  Whitaker has also been accused of appropriating training materials produced by the Chicago Police Department which he used as the basis for a lucrative contract with the Phoenix Police Department.  Whitaker was to receive $268,800 to provide “cultural-consciousness training” to Phoenix police.  The Phoenix Police Department wants back the $21,900 it has paid thus far. He was placed on administrative leave on September 17, 2015, while the university investigated allegations that "his behavior has fallen short of expectations as a faculty member and a scholar."<ref name=PlacedonLeave>{{cite news|last1=Ryman|first1=Anne|title=Controversial ASU professor Whitaker placed on leave|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/tempe/2015/09/17/asu-professor-whitaker-placed-leave/32541923/|accessdate=30 September 2015|publisher=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=18 September 2015}}</ref>
