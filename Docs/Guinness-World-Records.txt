'''''Guinness World Records''''', known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as '''''The Guinness Book of Records''''' and in previous [[United States|U.S.]] editions as '''''The Guinness Book of World Records''''', is a [[reference book]] published annually, listing [[world record]]s and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-copyright-book/|title=Best-selling annual publication|website=Guinness World Records|access-date=2016-06-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Bruce|date=August 2005|title=World's Unlikeliest Bestseller|journal=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|pages=76–81}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=|date=January 2016}} As of the 2016 edition, it is now in its 62nd year of publication.
The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in ''Guinness World Records'' becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organization employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records.<ref name=faq>{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/faq.aspx |publisher=Guinness World Records |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=10 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20120124172127/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com:80/faq.aspx |archivedate=24 January 2012 }}</ref>

==History==
On 10 November 1951, Sir [[Hugh Beaver]], then the managing director of the [[Guinness]] Breweries,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://guinness.book-of-records.info/history.html |title=The History of the Book |work=Guinness Record Book Collecting |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> went on a shooting party in the [[North Slob]], by the [[River Slaney]] in [[County Wexford]], Ireland. After missing a shot at a [[Eurasian Golden Plover|golden plover]], he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest [[Game (food)|game bird]] in Europe, the [[Eurasian Golden Plover|golden plover]] or the [[red grouse]]. (It is the plover.<ref>{{cite book|author=Fionn Davenport|title=Ireland|year= 2010|page=193|isbn=9781742203508|publisher=Lonely Planet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfL3QnPMi9oC&pg=PA193}}</ref>) That evening at [[Castlebridge]] House, he realised that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freespace.virgin.net/james.robertson/history2.htm |title=Early history of Guinness World Records |page=2 |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070701200438/http://freespace.virgin.net:80/james.robertson/history2.htm |archivedate=1 July 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Publication of the Guinness Book of Records: 27 August 1955|first=Richard|last=Cavendish|journal=[[History Today]]|volume=55|date=August 2005}}</ref> Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland and abroad, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realised then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful.<ref>{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2005|year=2004|page=6|isbn=1892051222|publisher=Guinness; 50th Anniversary edition}}</ref>

Beaver's idea became reality when Guinness employee [[Christopher Chataway]] recommended University friends [[Norris McWhirter|Norris]] and [[Ross McWhirter]], who had been running a fact-finding agency in London. The brothers were commissioned to compile what became ''The Guinness Book of Records'' in August 1954. A thousand copies were printed and given away.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spyhunter007.com/spy_guinness_book_history.htm|title=Guinness Book History 1950 - Present|work=spyhunter007.com}}</ref>

After the founding of ''The Guinness Book of Records'' at 107 [[Fleet Street]], the first 198-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British best seller lists by Christmas. Beaver said: "It was a marketing give away – it wasn't supposed to be a money maker".{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The following year, it launched in the US, and sold 70,000 copies. Since then, ''Guinness World Records'' has become a household name and the global leader in world records. The book has gone on to become a record breaker in its own right; with sales of more than 100 million copies in 100 different countries and 37 languages, ''Guinness World Records'' is the world's best selling copyright book ever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/index.aspx|title=Guinness World Records Corporate - Home|work=guinnessworldrecords.com}}</ref>

Because the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas. The McWhirters continued to compile it for many years. Both brothers had an encyclopedic memory; on the TV series ''[[Record Breakers]]'', based upon the book, they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer. [[Ross McWhirter#Murder|Ross McWhirter was assassinated]] by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] in 1975.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3643039.stm |title=Record Breakers' McWhirter dies|date=20 April 2004 |accessdate=9 June 2014 |newspaper=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> Following Ross' assassination, the feature in the show where questions about records posed by children were answered was called ''Norris on the Spot''.

Guinness Superlatives (later Guinness World Records) Limited was formed in 1954 to publish the first book. [[Sterling Publishing]] owned the rights to the ''Guinness'' book in the US for decades, and, under their management, the book became a household name. The group was owned by Guinness PLC and subsequently [[Diageo]] until 2001, when it was purchased by [[Gullane Entertainment]]. Gullane was itself purchased by [[HIT Entertainment]] in 2002. In 2006, [[Apax Partners]] purchased HiT and subsequently sold Guinness World Records in early 2008 to the [[Jim Pattison Group]], the parent company of [[Ripley Entertainment]], which is licensed to operate [[Guinness World Records' Attractions]]. With offices in New York City and Tokyo, Guinness World Records' global headquarters remain in London, while its museum attractions are based at Ripley headquarters in [[Orlando, Florida]], US.

==Evolution==
[[File:Lucky Diamond Rich face.jpg|left|210px|thumb|[[Lucky Diamond Rich]] is "the world's most tattooed person", and has tattoos covering his entire body. He holds the Guinness world record {{As of|2006|lc=y}}, being 100 percent tattooed.]]
Recent editions have focused on record feats by person competitors. Competitions range from obvious ones such as [[Olympic weightlifting]] to the longest [[egg tossing]] distances, or for longest time spent playing ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' or the number of hot dogs  that can be consumed in ten minutes, although eating and alcohol consumption entries are no longer accepted, possibly for fear of litigation. Besides records about competitions, it contains such facts as the heaviest tumour, the most poisonous plant, the shortest river ([[Roe River]]), the two longest-running dramas (''[[General Hospital]]'' and ''[[Guiding Light]]'') in the US, and the world's most successful salesman ([[Joe Girard]]), among others. Many records also relate to the youngest person who achieved something, such as the youngest person to visit all nations of the world, being [[Maurizio Giuliano]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records|year=2006|page=126|edition=UK}}</ref>

Each edition contains a selection of the large set of records in the Guinness database; the criteria for inclusion changed over the years. New records are added.

The ousting of Norris McWhirter from his consulting role in 1995 and the subsequent decision by Diageo Plc to sell the Guinness World Records brand have shifted it from a text-oriented to an illustrated reference book ("style over substance"). The majority of world records are no longer listed in the book or on the website, and can only be determined by a written application to Guinness to 'break' the record. For those unable to wait the 4–6 weeks for a reply, Guinness will process a 'fast-track' application for £300 (US$450).

The ''Guinness Book of Records'' is the world's most sold copyrighted book, earning it an entry within its own pages. A number of spin-off books and television series have also been produced.

''Guinness World Records'' bestowed the record of "Person with the most records" on [[Ashrita Furman]] of Queens, NY in April 2009. At that time, he held 100 records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Guinness-World-Records-honors-one-mans-historic-milestone-100-Records-Broken/blog/241933/7691.html |title=Guinness World Records honors one man's historic milestone – 100 Records Broken! – Guinness World Records Blog post |publisher=community.guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=29 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090612221225/http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com:80/_Guinness-World-Records-honors-one-mans-historic-milestone-100-Records-Broken/blog/241933/7691.html? |archivedate=12 June 2009 }}</ref>

For many records, Guinness World Records is the effective authority on the exact requirements for them and with whom records reside, the company providing adjudicators to events to determine the veracity of record attempts. The list of records which the Guinness World Records covers is not fixed; records may be added and also removed for various reasons. The public are invited to submit applications for records, which can be either the bettering of existing records or substantial achievements which could constitute a new record.<ref name=faq/> The company also provides corporate services for companies to "harness the power of record-breaking to deliver tangible success for their businesses."<ref name="corporate">{{cite web |url=http://corporate.guinnessworldrecords.com/ |title=Guinness World Records Corportate |publisher=Guinness World Records |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref>

===Ethical issues and safety concerns===
[[File:Guinness Beer Record 1977.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Steven Petrosino drinking 1 liter of beer in 1.3 seconds in June 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerrecord.com|title=Guinness World Beer Record|date=11 June 2004|accessdate=10 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbX33Zkl9Nw|title=Video clip|accessdate=29 April 2007}}</ref> Petrosino set record times for 250 ml, 500 ml and 1.5 liters as well, but Guinness accepted only the record for one liter. They later dropped all beer and alcohol records from their compendium in 1991, and reinstated the records in 2008.]]
Guinness World Records states several types of records it will not accept for ethical reasons, such as those related to the killing or harming of animals.<ref name="isitarecord">{{cite web |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/is-it-a-record/ |title=IS YOUR PROPOSAL A POTENTIAL GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS™ ACHIEVEMENT? |publisher="Guinness World Records" |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref>

Several world records that were once included in the book have been removed for ethical reasons, including concerns for the wellbeing of potential record breakers. For example, following publication of a "heaviest fish" record, many fish owners overfed their pets beyond the bounds of what was healthy, and therefore such entries were removed.<ref>[http://www.fish-world.com.au/FishRecords.htm Fish World Records]{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}. Fish-World. Retrieved on 19 October 2010.</ref> The Guinness Book also dropped records within their "eating and drinking records" section of Human Achievements in 1991 over concerns that potential competitors could harm themselves and expose the publisher to potential [[lawsuit|litigation]].<ref name="discontinue"/> These changes included the removal of all [[liquor]], wine, and beer drinking records, along with other unusual records for consuming such unlikely things as bicycles and trees.<ref name="discontinue">{{cite book|title=Guinness Book of World Records|year=1990|page=464}}</ref> Other records, such as [[sword swallowing]] and rally driving (on public roads), were closed from further entry as the current holders had performed beyond what are considered safe human tolerance levels.

There have been instances of closed records being reopened. For example, the sword swallowing record was listed as closed in the 1990 Guinness Book of World Records, but the ''[[Guinness World Records Primetime]]'' TV show, which started in 1998, accepted three sword swallowing challenges (and so did the 2007 edition of the ''Guinness World Records'' onwards). Similarly, the speed beer drinking records which were dropped from the book in 1991, reappeared 17 years later in the 2008 edition, but were moved from the "Human Achievements" section of the older book<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beerrecord.com/guinnessbook.htm |title=Guinness World Record Book Entry |work=Guinness World Beer Record |date=11 June 2004 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref> to the "Modern Society" section of the newer edition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guinness World Record Book Entry 2008|url=http://www.beerrecord.com/guinnessbook_2008.htm|work=Guinness World Beer Record|date=11 June 2004|accessdate=10 February 2012}}</ref>

{{As of|2011}}, it is required in the guidelines of all "large food" type records that the item be fully edible, and distributed to the public for consumption, to prevent food wastage.<ref name=faq/>{{dead link|date=October 2015}}

[[Chain letter]]s are also not allowed: "Guinness World Records does not accept any records relating to chain letters, sent by post or e-mail. If you receive a letter or an e-mail, which may promise to publish the names of all those who send it on, please destroy it, it is a hoax. No matter if it says that Guinness World Records and the postal service are involved, they are not."<ref name=faq/>

===Difficulty in defining records===
For some potential categories, ''Guinness World Records'' has declined to list some records that are too difficult or impossible to determine. For example, its website states: "We do not accept any claims for beauty as it is not objectively measurable."<ref name=isitarecord/>

On 10 December 2010, ''Guinness World Records'' stopped its new "[[dreadlock]]" category after investigation of its first and only female title holder, Asha Mandela, determining it was impossible to judge this record accurately.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.guinnessworldrecords.com/_Longest-Dreadlock-Record-Rested/BLOG/3083932/7691.html |title=Longest Dreadlock Recor&nbsp;– Rested&nbsp;– Guinness World Records Blog post&nbsp;– Home of the Longest, Shortest, Fastest, Tallest facts and feats |publisher=Community.guinnessworldrecords.com |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>

==Museums==
[[File:6764 Guinness.JPG|thumb|Guinness Museum in [[Hollywood]]]]
In 1976, a ''Guinness Book of World Records'' museum opened in the [[Empire State Building]]. Speed shooter [[Bob Munden]] then went on tour promoting ''The Guinness Book of World Records'' by performing his record fast draws with a standard weight single-action revolver from a western movie type holster. His fastest time for a draw was .02 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bobmunden.com|title=Bob Munden • Six-Gun Magic Custom Gunsmithing - Bob & Becky Munden - Six-Gun Magic Gunwork|work=bobmunden.com}}</ref> Among exhibits were life-size statues of the world's tallest man ([[Robert Wadlow]]) and world's largest earth worm, an X-ray photo of a sword swallower, repeated lightning strike victim [[Roy Sullivan]]'s hat complete with lightning holes and a pair of gem-studded golf shoes on sale for $6500.<ref>''In Praise of Facts'', by John Leonard, the introduction to the New York Times Desk Reference</ref> The museum closed in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951231&slug=2160261|title=Travel & Outdoors - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly: A 1995 Travel Retrospective - Seattle Times Newspaper|work=nwsource.com}}</ref>

In more recent years the Guinness company has permitted the [[franchising]] of small museums with displays based on the book, all currently ({{As of|2010|lc=y}}) located in towns popular with tourists: [[Tokyo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[San Antonio]].
There were once Guinness World Records museums and exhibitions at the [[Trocadero (London)|Trocadero]] in London, [[Bangalore]], [[San Francisco]], [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]],<ref name="museum-orlando-lostparks">{{cite web| url=http://www.lostparks.com/guinness.html|title=The Guinness World Records Experience: one of Florida's Lost Tourist Attractions|accessdate=1 February 2009|last=Brown|first=Robert H.}}</ref> [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], New Jersey,<ref name="museum-locations">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessattractions.com/locations.aspx |title=Guinness World Records Experience locations |accessdate=1 February 2009 |author=Ripley Entertainment, Inc |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090120225858/http://guinnessattractions.com:80/locations.aspx |archivedate=20 January 2009 }}</ref> and [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].<ref name="museum-locations-archive"/> The Orlando museum, which closed in 2002, was branded ''The Guinness Records Experience'';<ref name="museum-orlando-lostparks" /> the Hollywood, [[Niagara Falls]], Copenhagen, and [[Gatlinburg, Tennessee|Gatlinburg]], Tennessee museums also previously featured this branding.<ref name="museum-locations-archive">{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessattractions.com/|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20021120040920/http://www.guinnessattractions.com/|archivedate=20 November 2002|title=Guinness World Records Experience locations|work=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|date=20 November 2002|accessdate=1 February 2009|author=Ripley Entertainment, Inc.}}</ref>

* ''Guinness World Records: 50 Years, 50 Records'' - on ITV (UK)

With the popularity of reality television, Guinness World Records began to market itself as the originator of the television genre, with slogans such as ''we wrote the book on Reality TV''.
[[File:Ironing guinness 0357.JPG|right|250px|thumb|[[Suresh Joachim|Suresh Joachim Arulanantham]] is a Tamil Canadian film actor and producer and multiple-Guinness World Record holder who has broken over 50 world records set in several countries in attempts to benefit the underprivileged children around the world. Some world record attempts are more unusual than others: he is pictured here minutes away from breaking the [[ironing]] world record at 55 hours and 5 minutes, at [[Shoppers World, Brampton]].]]

==Gamer's edition==
{{Main|Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition}}
In 2008, Guinness World Records released its gamer's edition in association with [[Twin Galaxies]]. The Gamer's Edition contains 258 pages, over 1236 video game related world records and four interviews including one with Twin Galaxies founder [[Walter Day]]. The most recent edition is the ''Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition, 2016,'' which was released September 2015.

==British pop music volume==
{{Main|British Hit Singles & Albums}}
The ''[[Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums]]'' was published from 2004 to 2008, based on two earlier, separate HiT publications, ''British Hit Singles'' and ''British Hit Albums'', which began in 1977. It was effectively replaced (in singles part) by the ''Virgin Book of British Hit Singles'' from 2008 onward.

==Other media==

===Video games===
A [[video game]], ''[[Guinness World Records: The Video Game]]'', was developed by [[TT Fusion]] and released for [[Nintendo DS]], [[Wii]] and [[iOS]] in November 2008.

===Film===
In 2012, [[Warner Bros.]] announced the development of a live-action film version of Guinness World Records with [[Daniel Chun]] as scriptwriter. The film version will apparently use the heroic achievements of record holders as the basis for a narrative that should have global appeal.<ref name="GuinessFilm">{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/08/guinness-book-world-records-film | title=Guinness Book of World Records could be next big brand name to hit cinemas | publisher=Guardian | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref>

=== Music ===
In 2006, [[Michael Jackson]] visited the office of Guinness World Records in London to collect 8 certificates of official records related to his successful career as a singer, dancer and composer of songs.
