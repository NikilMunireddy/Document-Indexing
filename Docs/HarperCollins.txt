'''HarperCollins Publishers LLC''' is one of the world's largest publishing companies and is part of the "[[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group#See also|Big Five]]" English-language publishing companies, alongside [[Hachette (publisher)|Hachette]], [[Holtzbrinck]]/[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]], [[Penguin Random House]], and [[Simon & Schuster]]. The company is headquartered in New York City and is a subsidiary of [[News Corp]]. The company name is a combination of several publishing firm names: [[Harper & Row]], an American publishing company acquired in 1987, whose own name was the result of an earlier merger of [[Harper & Brothers]] (founded 1817) and Row, Peterson & Company; together with UK publishing company [[William Collins, Sons]] (founded 1819), acquired in 1990.

The worldwide CEO of HarperCollins is Brian Murray.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.observer.com/2008/its-official-jane-friedman-out-harpercollins-her-deputy-effective-immediately|title=It's Official: Jane Friedman Out at HarperCollins, Her Deputy Up 'Effective Immediately'|last=Neyfakh|first=Leon|date=June 4, 2008|work=[[The New York Observer]]|accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref> HarperCollins has publishing groups in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India. The company publishes many different [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]]s, both former independent publishing houses and new imprints.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
In 1989, Collins was bought by [[Rupert Murdoch]]'s [[News Corporation]], and the publisher was combined with Harper & Row, which NewsCorp had acquired two years earlier. In addition to the simplified and merged name, the logo for HarperCollins was derived from the torch logo for Harper and Row, and the fountain logo for Collins, which were combined into a stylized set of flames atop waves.

In 1999, News Corporation purchased the Hearst Book Group, consisting of [[William Morrow & Company]] and [[Avon Books]]. These imprints are now published under the rubric of HarperCollins.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.newscorp.com/news/news_077.html|title=News Corporation Announces Plans To Acquire William Morrow & Company And Avon Books From The Hearst Corporation|date=June 17, 1999|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=August 6, 2012|location=New York|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209220010/http://www.newscorp.com/news/news_077.html|archivedate=Dec 9, 2006}}</ref>

HarperCollins bought educational publisher [[Letts and Lonsdale]] in March 2010.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 2011, HarperCollins announced they had agreed to acquire the publisher [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= October 31, 2011 |title=HarperCollins to Acquire Thomas Nelson  |journal=''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/industry-deals/article/49334-harpercollins-to-acquire-thomas-nelson.html |accessdate= }}</ref> The purchase was completed on July 11, 2012, with an announcement that Thomas Nelson would operate independently given the position it has in Christian book publishing.<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.thomasnelsoncorporate.com/2012/07/harpercollins-finalizes-acquisition-of-thomas-nelson/ |title=HarperCollins Finalizes Acquisition of Thomas Nelson |first=Casey|last=Francis |publisher=Thomas Nelson, Inc. |date=July 11, 2012 |accessdate=August 6, 2012}}</ref> Both Thomas Nelson and [[Zondervan]] were then organized as imprints, or "keystone publishing programs," under a new division, HarperCollins Christian Publishing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harpercollinschristian.com/info/|title=Company Information {{!}} HarperCollins Christian Publishing|website=HarperCollins Company Information|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.harpercollins.com/us/harpercollins-imprints/christian-publishing|title=Christian Publishing|website=HarperCollins Corporate|publisher=HarperCollins|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref> Key roles in the reorganization were awarded to former Thomas Nelson executives.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Greenfield|first1=Jeremy|title=Reorganization at HarperCollins Christian Publishing Leaves Mix of Zondervan and Thomas Nelson Execs in Charge|url=http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2012/reorganization-at-harpercollins-christian-publishing-leaves-mix-of-zondervan-and-thomas-nelson-execs-in-charge/|accessdate=24 September 2015|work=Digital Book World|publisher=F+W Media|date=5 September 2012|quote=While the senior executive appointments announced today by HarperCollins in a statement come from both houses, the most important roles seem to have been reserved for former Thomas Nelson executives: the new chief financial officer, head of e-media, head of sales and head of communications, for instance, are all former Thomas Nelson executives.}}</ref>

===Management history===

Notable management figures include [[Lisa Sharkey]], current senior vice president and director of creative development and Barry Winkleman from 1989 to 1994.

===United States v. Apple Inc.===
In April 2012, the United States Department of Justice filed ''[[United States v. Apple Inc.]]'', naming [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], HarperCollins, and four other major publishers as defendants.  The suit alleged that they conspired to fix prices for [[e-books]], and weaken [[Amazon.com]]'s position in the market, in violation of [[United States antitrust law|antitrust law]].<ref name="washington post DOJ sues">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/justice-department-files-suit-against-apple-publishers-report-says/2012/04/11/gIQAzyXSAT_story.html | title=Justice Department sues Apple, publishers over e-book prices | work=The Washington Post | date=April 11, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2014 | author=Mui, Ylan Q. and Hayley Tsukayama}}</ref>

In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which HarperCollins and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.<ref name="usatoday settlements rolling out">{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/03/25/amazon-settlements-ebooks/6869033/ | title=E-book price fixing settlements rolling out | work=USA Today | date=March 25, 2014 | accessdate=June 1, 2014 | author=Molina, Brett}}</ref>

===U.S. warehouse closings===
It was announced to employees privately and then later in the day on November 5, 2012, that HarperCollins was closing its remaining two U.S. warehouses, in order to merge shipping and warehousing operations with [[RR Donnelley|R. R. Donnelley]] in Indiana. The Scranton, PA warehouse closed in September 2013 and a Nashville, TN warehouse, under the name (D.B.A.) Thomas Nelson (which distributes the religious arm of HarperCollins/Zondervan Books), in the winter of 2013. Several office positions and departments continued to work for HarperCollins in Scranton, but in a new location.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2012/11/06/harpercollins-to-close-warehouses-in.html | title=HarperCollins to close warehouses in deal with R.R.

The Scranton warehouse closing eliminated approximately 200 jobs, and the Nashville warehouse closing eliminated up to 500 jobs (exact number of distribution employees is unknown)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20130814/BUSINESS02/308140115/2095/BUSINESS02 |title= HarperCollins Publishers to sell Nashville distribution center |publisher=The Tennesseean |first=Getahn|last=Ward |date=August 14, 2003}}</ref>

HarperCollins previously closed 2 U.S. warehouses, one in Williamsport, PA in 2011 and another in Grand Rapids, MI in 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/manufacturing/article/47183-harper-donnelley-in-wide-ranging-supply-chain-deal.html |title=Harper, Donnelley in Wide Ranging Supply Chain Deal |publisher=''Publishers Weekly'' |first= Jim|last= Milliot |date=May 12, 2011}}</ref> “We have taken a long-term, global view of our print distribution and are committed to offering the broadest possible reach for our authors," said HarperCollins Chief Executive Brian Murray, according to Publishers Weekly."We are retooling the traditional distribution model to ensure we can competitively offer the entire HarperCollins catalog to customers regardless of location.” Company officials attribute the closings and mergers to the rapidly growing demand for e-book formats and the decline in print purchasing.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Business strategy==
[[File:ASA conference 2008 - 31.JPG|thumb|2008 conference booth]]

===Web approach===
In order to both boost book sales and reach the online market, HarperCollins has created a browsing feature on its website, whereby customers can read selected excerpts from books before purchasing.<ref>[http://mashable.com/2008/02/10/harpercollins-free-previews/ HarperCollins (Finally) Offers Free Books Online<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref><ref>Pace, Andrew K. “Technically Speaking.” American Libraries 2006 April: 80.</ref> There are some concerns among publishers with this approach because they feel that the online books could be exploited by file-sharing.<ref>Lowry, Tom. “Getting Out Of a Bind.” Business Week2006 April 10; 79.</ref> In addition, excerpts of books are also available to mobile phone users.<ref>[http://mashable.com/2007/08/15/harpercollins-iphone/ HarperCollins Offers Books on the iPhone<!-- Bot generated title -->].</ref> HarperCollins were first to market with an innovative approach to [[slushpile]] management with the introduction of the [[authonomy]] website. From 2009 to 2010, they operated [[Bookarmy]], a social networking site.

At the beginning of October 2013, the company announced a partnership with online digital library [[Scribd]]. The official statement revealed that the "majority" of the HarperCollins US and HarperCollins Christian catalogs will be available in Scribd's subscription service. Chantal Restivo-Alessi, chief digital officer at HarperCollins, explained to the media that the deal represents the first time that the publisher has released such a large portion of its catalog.<ref>{{cite web|title=With HarperCollins Deal, Scribd Unveils Its Bid To Become The Netflix For Books|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/01/scribd-harpercollins-book-subscriptions/?ncid=tcdaily|work=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=October 1, 2013|first=Anthony|last=Ha|date=October 1, 2013}}</ref>

===Speakers Bureau===
The '''HarperCollins Speakers Bureau''' (also known as HCSB) is the first lecture agency to be created by a major publishing house.<ref name="mcgee"/> It was launched in May 2005<ref name="mcgee">McGee, Celia. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/04/business/media/04speakers.html?ref=business "A Way to Give Authors a Lucrative Second Platform."] ''The New York Times'', 4 June 2007.

===HarperStudio===
HarperCollins announced HarperStudio in 2008 as a "new, experimental unit... that will eliminate the traditional profit distributions to authors. The long-established author advances and bookseller returns has not proved to be very profitable to either the author or the publisher. The approach HarperStudio is now taking is to offer little or no advance, but instead to split the profit 50% (rather than the industry standard 15%), with the author." The division was headed by Bob Miller, previously the founding publisher of [[Disney Hyperion|Hyperion]], the adult books division of the [[Walt Disney Company]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/business/04harper.html?_r=1&oref=slogin|title=New HarperCollins Unit to Try to Cut Writer Advances|author=Rich, Motoko|publisher=''New York Times''|date=April 4, 2008|accessdate=April 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080403/ap_en_bu/books_publisher_switch|title=Hyperion publisher goes to HarperCollins|author=Italie, Hillel|publisher=Associated Press|date=April 3, 2008|accessdate=April 4, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080408064317/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080403/ap_en_bu/books_publisher_switch <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate =April 8, 2008}}</ref> HarperStudio folded in March 2010 after Miller left for [[Workman Publishing]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2010/04/that-was-fast-say-goodbye-to-harper-studio.html|title=That was fast: say goodbye to Harper Studio|author=Kellogg, Carolyn|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|date=April 2, 2010}}</ref>
