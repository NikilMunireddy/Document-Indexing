The '''Australian dollar''' ([[currency sign|sign]]: '''$'''; [[ISO 4217|code]]: '''AUD''') is the [[currency]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], including [[Christmas Island]], [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], and [[Norfolk Island]], as well as the independent [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island states]] of [[Kiribati]], [[Nauru]] and [[Tuvalu]]. Within Australia, it is almost always abbreviated with the [[dollar sign]] ('''$'''), with '''A$''' sometimes used to distinguish it from other [[dollar]]-denominated currencies.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Web content style guide: an essential reference for online writers ... | first1=Gerry | last1=McGovern | first2=Rob | last2=Norton | first3=Catherine | last3=O'Dowd | page=104 | isbn=978-0-273-65605-0 | publisher=[[FT Press]] | year=2002 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wH3nimSNWSsC&pg=PA104&ei=NVpTTMv4AoPQsAPi1azZAg | accessdate=30 July 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-chap?lang=eng&lettr=indx_catlog&info0=5.26 | title=The Canadian Style | publisher=Dundurn Press/[[Public Works and Government Services Canada|Translation Bureau]] | year=1997 | isbn=1-55002-276-8 | accessdate=30 July 2010 }}</ref> It is subdivided into 100 [[cent (currency)|cents]].

It trades in the world [[foreign exchange market]]s behind the [[United States dollar|US dollar]], the [[euro]], the [[Japanese yen|yen]] and the [[pound sterling]].<ref name=BIS/> The Australian dollar is popular with currency traders, because of the comparatively high interest rates in Australia, the relative freedom of the foreign exchange market from government intervention, the general stability of [[Economy of Australia|Australia's economy]] and political system, and the prevailing view that the Australian dollar offers diversification benefits in a portfolio containing the major world currencies, especially because of its greater exposure to Asian economies and the commodities cycle.<ref name="SMH1" /> The currency is commonly referred to by foreign-exchange traders as the "Aussie dollar".

With pounds, shillings and pence to be replaced by [[decimalisation|decimal currency]] on 14 February 1966, many names for the new currency were suggested. In 1965, the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], [[Sir Robert Menzies]], a monarchist, wished to name the currency the ''royal''. Other proposed names included more exotic suggestions such as the ''austral'', the ''oz'', the ''boomer'', the ''roo'', the ''kanga'', the ''emu'', the ''digger'', the ''quid'', the ''dinkum'' and the ''ming'' (Menzies' nickname). Menzies' influence resulted in the selection of the ''royal'', and trial designs were prepared and printed by the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]]. The Treasurer, [[Harold Holt]], announced the decision in Parliament on 5 June 1963. The ''royal'' would be subdivided into 100 cents, but the existing names ''shilling'', ''florin'' and ''crown'' would be retained for the 10-cent, 20-cent and 50-cent coins respectively. The name ''royal'' for the currency proved very unpopular, with Holt and his wife even receiving death threats.  On 24 July Holt told the Cabinet the decision had been a "terrible mistake" and it would need to be revisited. On 18 September Holt advised Parliament that the name was to be the ''dollar'', of 100 cents.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Royal Controversy|url=http://museum.rba.gov.au/displays/rba-currency-reform/#the-royal-controversy|work=Reserve Bank of Australia Museum|publisher=[[Reserve Bank of Australia]]|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref><ref>''The Age'', 5 June 2013, Money, p.8</ref>

The [[Australian pound]], introduced in 1910 and officially distinct in value from the [[pound sterling]] since devaluation in 1931,<ref>{{cite web|title=Banknotes of the 1930s|url=http://museum.rba.gov.au/displays/commbank-and-note-issue/#banknotes-of-the-1930s|work=Reserve Bank of Australia Museum|publisher=[[Reserve Bank of Australia]]|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> was replaced by the dollar on 14 February 1966.<ref>{{cite web|title=Introducing the New Decimal Banknotes|url=http://museum.rba.gov.au/displays/rba-currency-reform/#introducing-the-new-decimal-banknotes|work=Reserve Bank of Australia Museum|publisher=[[Reserve Bank of Australia]]|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref> The rate of conversion for the new decimal currency was two dollars per Australian pound, or ten Australian [[shilling]]s per dollar. The exchange rate was pegged to the pound sterling at a rate of $1 = 8 shillings ($2.50 = UK £1). In 1967, Australia effectively left the [[sterling area]], when the pound sterling was devalued against the US dollar and the Australian dollar did not follow. It maintained its peg to the US dollar at the rate of A$1 = US$1.12.

On 27 September 2012, the [[Reserve Bank of Australia]] stated that they had ordered work on a project to upgrade the current banknotes. The upgraded banknotes will incorporate a number of new features so that they remain secure into the future.<ref>Media Release: R.B.A.: ''Upgrading Australia's Banknotes'' http://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2012/mr-12-27.html</ref> The first new banknotes will be issued from 1 September 2016, with the remaining denominations issued in the coming years.<ref>''The Next Generation Banknote Project'' http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/bulletin/2014/mar/1.html</ref>

==Coins==
{{Main|Coins of the Australian dollar}}
In 1966, coins were introduced in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents. The initial 50-cent coins contained high silver (80%) content and were withdrawn after a year after the intrinsic value of the silver content was found to exceed the face value of the coins. One-dollar coins were introduced in 1984, followed by two-dollar coins in 1988. The one- and two-cent coins were discontinued in 1991 and withdrawn from circulation. In commemoration of the 40th anniversary of [[decimal currency]], the 2006 mint [[Proof coinage|proof]] and [[Coin grading|uncirculated]] sets included one- and two-cent coins. In early 2013, Australia's first triangular coin was introduced, to mark the 25th anniversary of the opening of Parliament House. The silver $5 coin is 99.9% silver and depicts Parliament House as viewed from one of its courtyards.<ref>ABC News ''Triangular coin celebrates Parliament House's birthday'' http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-09/first-triangular-coin-celebrates-parliament-birthday/4679654</ref> Cash transactions are [[Swedish rounding|rounded to the nearest five cents]]. As with most public changes to currency systems, there has been a great amount of [[seignorage]] of the discontinued coins. All coins portray the reigning Australian Sovereign, Queen [[Elizabeth II]], on the obverse, and are produced by the [[Royal Australian Mint]].

Australia has regularly issued commemorative 50-cent coins. The first was in 1970, commemorating [[James Cook]]'s exploration along the east coast of the Australian continent, followed in 1977 by a coin for Queen Elizabeth II's [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]], the wedding of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] in 1981, the [[Brisbane]] [[Commonwealth Games]] in 1982, and the [[Australian Bicentenary]] in 1988. Issues expanded into greater numbers in the 1990s and the 21st century, responding to collector demand. Australia has also made special issues of 20-cent, one-dollar and two-dollar coins.

Current Australian 5-, 10- and 20-cent coins are identical in size to the former Australian, New Zealand, and British sixpence, shilling, and two shilling (florin) coins. In 1990, the UK replaced these coins with smaller versions, as did New Zealand in 2006 – at the same time discontinuing the five-cent coin. With a mass of 15.55&nbsp;g and a diameter of 31.51&nbsp;mm, the Australian 50-cent coin is one of the largest coins used in the world today. In circulation, the old New Zealand 5-, 10- and 20-cent coins were often mistaken for Australian coins of the same value, owing to their identical size and shape. Until the size of the New Zealand coins was changed in 2004, Australian coins below the dollar in value were in circulation in both countries. Still, some confusion occurs  with the larger-denomination coins in the two countries; Australia's $1 coin is similar in size to New Zealand's $2 coin, and the New Zealand $1 coin is similar in size to Australia's $2 coin. As such, Australian coins are occasionally found in New Zealand and vice versa.

===First series===
The first paper issues of the Australian dollar were issued in 1966. The $1, $2, $10 and $20 notes had exact equivalents in the former pound banknotes. The $5 note was issued in 1967, the $50 note was issued in 1973 and the $100 was issued in 1984.<ref>''History of Banknotes'' http://banknotes.rba.gov.au/australias-banknotes/history/</ref>

===Polymer series===
The first [[polymer banknotes]] were issued in 1988<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-20071644 | work=BBC News | title=Wi-fi, dual-flush loos and eight more Australian inventions | date=8 November 2012}}</ref> by the Reserve Bank of Australia, specifically [[polypropylene]] [[polymer banknote]]s (produced by [[Note Printing Australia]]), to commemorate the bicentenary of European settlement in Australia.
All Australian notes are now made of polymer.

===New Polymer series===
A new series of banknotes is being introduced, starting with the $5 note from 1 September 2016.{{cn |date=April 2015}}

In 1966, when the dollar was introduced, the international currency relationships were maintained under the [[Bretton Woods system]], a fixed exchange rate system using a U.S. dollar standard. The Australian dollar, however, was effectively pegged to the British pound at an equivalent value of approximately 1&nbsp;gram of gold.

The highest valuation of the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar was during the period of the peg to the U.S. dollar.  On 9 September 1973, the peg was adjusted to US$1.4875, the fluctuation limits being changed to US$1.485–US$1.490;<ref>{{cite book |title=World Currency Yearbook, 1984 |isbn=0-917645-00-6 |page=75}}</ref> on both 7 December 1973 and 10 December 1973, the noon buying rate in New York City for cable transfers payable in foreign currencies reached its highest point of 1.4885 U.S. dollars to one dollar.<ref>{{cite web |title=U.S. / Australia Foreign Exchange Rate |url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/DEXUSAL.txt |accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref>

On 12 December 1983, the dollar was floated, allowing its value to fluctuate dependent on supply and demand on international money markets. The decision was made on 8 December 1983 and announced on 9 December 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title=20 years since Aussie dollar floated |url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2003/s1005317.htm |accessdate=14 October 2010 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=8 December 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011022103/http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2003/s1005317.htm |archivedate=11 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

In the two decades that followed, its highest value relative to the US dollar was $0.881 in December 1988. The lowest ever value of the dollar after it was floated was 47.75 US cents in April 2001.<ref>{{cite news |title=Global risk weighs on Howard's agenda |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/BUSINESS/asia/11/12/aust.economy.biz/ |accessdate=14 October 2010 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=12 November 2001}}</ref> It returned to above 96 US cents in June 2008,<ref>{{cite news |title=Dollar Falls Before RBA Meeting: New Zealand's Drops |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aQV4HwdZoDek |accessdate=14 October 2010 |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |date=30 June 2008}}</ref> and reached 98.49 later that year. Although the value of the dollar fell significantly from this high towards the end of 2008, it gradually recovered in 2009 to 94 US cents.

On 15 October 2010, the dollar reached parity with the US dollar for the first time since becoming a freely traded currency, trading above US$1 for a few seconds.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dollar hits parity vs US dollar |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1518042820101015|accessdate=15 October 2010 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=15 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018073348/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1518042820101015 |archivedate=18 October 2010 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=no}}</ref> The currency then traded above parity for a sustained period of several days in November, and fluctuated around that mark into 2011.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dollar hits new post-float high after US central bank move |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/markets/australian-dollar-hits-new-post-float-high-after-us-central-bank-move/story-e6frg91o-1225947591487 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=25 January 2011 |first=Bradley |last=Davis |date=4 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122115604/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/markets/australian-dollar-hits-new-post-float-high-after-us-central-bank-move/story-e6frg91o-1225947591487 |archivedate=22 January 2011 <!--DASHBot--> |deadurl=no}}</ref> On 27 July 2011, the dollar hit a record high since floating.

Some commentators speculated that the value of the dollar in 2011 was related to Europe's sovereign debt crisis, and Australia's strong ties with material importers in Asia and in particular [[China]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skynews.com.au/businessnews/article.aspx?id=594335 |title=Sky News: Aussie dollar hits new highs |publisher=[[Sky News]] |date=28 March 2011 |accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref>

Economists posit that commodity prices are the dominant driver of the Australian dollar, and this means changes in exchange rates of the Australian dollar occur in ways opposite to many other currencies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westpac.com.au/docs/pdf/aw/economics-research/MarketInsights.pdf |work=Westpac |title=Westpac Market Insights March 2011 |page=4}}</ref> For decades, Australia's balance of trade has depended primarily upon commodity exports such as minerals and agricultural products. This means the Australian dollar varies significantly during the business cycle, rallying during global booms as Australia exports raw materials, and falling during recessions as mineral prices slump or when domestic spending overshadows the export earnings outlook. This movement is in the opposite direction to other reserve currencies, which tend to be stronger during market slumps as traders move value from falling stocks into cash.

The Australian dollar is a [[reserve currency]] and one of the most traded currencies in the world.<ref name="SMH1">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/aussie-now-fifth-mosttraded-currency-20100901-14nma.html |title=Aussie now fifth most traded currency |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=2 September 2010 |accessdate=19 April 2011 |author=Yeates, Clancy}}</ref>  Other factors in its popularity include a relative lack of central bank intervention, and general stability of the Australian economy and government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.safehaven.com/article/4608/analyzing-the-australian-dollar-up-down-and-under |title=Analyzing the Dollar – Up, Down, and Under |first=Gary|last=Dorsch |date=14 Feb 2006 |publisher=SafeHaven.com}}</ref> In January 2011 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], [[Alexey Ulyukaev]] announced that the [[Central Bank of Russia]] would begin keeping Australian dollar reserves.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://en.ria.ru/business/20120126/170960429.html |title=Russia to Keep Dollar Reserves From February |date=26 January 2012 |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]] |accessdate=27 January 2012 |location=[[Davos]], [[Switzerland]]}}</ref>

==Exchange rate policies==
[[File:ABC Dollar Float.ogv|thumb|1983 [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report on the first day of trading with a floating Dollar.]]
Prior to 1983, Australia maintained a [[fixed exchange rate]]. The first peg was between the Australian and British pounds, initially at par, and later at 0.8 GBP (16 shillings sterling). This reflected its historical ties as well as a view about the stability in value of the British pound. From 1946 to 1971, Australia maintained a peg under the [[Bretton Woods system]], a fixed exchange rate system that pegged the U.S. dollar to gold, but the Australian dollar was effectively pegged to sterling until 1967.

With the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, Australia converted the traditional peg to a fluctuating rate against the US dollar. In September 1974, Australia valued the dollar against a basket of currencies called the [[trade weighted index]] (TWI) in an effort to reduce the fluctuations associated with its tie to the US dollar.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/90a12181d877a6a6ca2568b5007b861c/d4a22ad91e0348bfca256fd3007baf93!OpenDocument | title=1350.0 – Australian Economic Indicators, Mar 1998 | publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] | date=8 December 2006 | accessdate=19 April 2011}}</ref> The daily TWI valuation was changed in November 1976 to a periodically adjusted valuation.

On 12 December 1983, the [[Australian Labor Party|Australian Labor]] [[government of Australia|government]] led by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Paul Keating]] [[Floating exchange rate|floated]] the dollar, with the exchange rate reflecting the balance of payments and other market drivers.

==Design and denominations==
Australia was the first country in the world to have a complete system of bank notes made from plastic (polymer). These notes provide much greater security against counterfeiting. The polymer notes are cleaner than paper notes, are more durable and easily recyclable.

Australia's currency comprises coins of 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent and one and two dollar denominations; and notes of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dollar denominations.

Many forms of currency were used in the Australian colonies after the arrival of the first European settlers in 1788. In the rough early conditions barter was necessary, and payment in commodities like rum sometimes replaced money in transactions. Some of the first official notes used in Australia were Police Fund Notes, issued by the Bank of New South Wales in 1816.

After 1901, when the Australian colonies federated into a single Commonwealth, the federal government became responsible for the currency. The [[Australian Bank Notes Tax Act 1910|Australian Notes Act]] was passed in 1910. In 1913 the first series of Australian notes was issued, based on the old British system of 12 pence to a shilling, 20 shillings to a pound.

In 1963, Australia initiated the change to decimal currency. More than 1000 submissions were made about the name of the new currency unit. The Prime Minister of the day, Sir Robert Menzies, proposed the 'royal'. The 'dollar' was eventually chosen as the name, and decimal currency was introduced on 14 February 1966.

Shortly after the changeover, substantial counterfeiting of $10 notes was detected. This provided an impetus for the Reserve Bank of Australia to develop new note technologies jointly with the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]].

The revolutionary polymer notes were first introduced in 1988 with the issue of a commemorative $10 note,<ref>''Other Banknotes'' http://banknotes.rba.gov.au/australias-banknotes/other-banknotes/</ref> marking Australia's bicentenary by featuring the theme of settlement. The note depicted on one side a young Aborigine in body paint, with other elements of Aboriginal culture. On the reverse side was the ship Supply from the First Fleet, with a background of Sydney Cove, as well as a group of people to illustrate the diverse backgrounds from which Australia has evolved over 200 years.

* The $100 note features world-renowned soprano [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]] (1861–1931), and the distinguished soldier, engineer and administrator [[John Monash|General Sir John Monash]] (1865–1931).<ref>''$100 Banknote'' http://banknotes.rba.gov.au/australias-banknotes/banknotes-in-circulation/hundred-dollar/</ref>

Polymer note technology was developed by Australia, and Australia prints polymer banknotes for a number of other countries. In 1988, Australia introduced its first polymer bank note and in 1996, Australia became the first country in the world to have a complete series of polymer notes. Australia's notes are printed by [[Note Printing Australia]], a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Note Printing Australia prints polymer notes or simply supplies the polymer substrate<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/spencer.pdf | page=4 | title=Paying with Polymer: Developing Canada's New Bank Notes | publisher=[[Bank of Canada]] | date=20 June 2011 | accessdate=12 Aug 2015}}</ref> for a growing number of other countries including [[Bangladesh]], [[Brunei]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Indonesia]], [[Kuwait]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mexico]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Romania]], [[Western Samoa]], [[Singapore]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]].

The 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent coins are made of [[cupronickel]] (75 percent copper and 25 percent nickel). The one and two dollar coins are made of aluminium bronze (92 percent copper, 6 per cent aluminium and 2 per cent nickel). The two dollar, one dollar, 50 and 20 cent circulating coins occasionally feature commemorative designs.

Australia's coins are produced by the Royal Australian Mint, which is located in the nation's capital, Canberra. Since opening in 1965, the Mint has produced more than 14 billion circulating coins, and has the capacity to produce more than two million coins per day, or more than 600 million coins per year. The Royal Australian Mint has an international reputation for producing quality numismatic coins, and won an international award for 'Best Silver Coin 2006' for its Silver Kangaroo coin design.

===Australian currency tactile feature===

In early 2015 the Reserve Bank of Australia announced that a tactile feature will be added to all new notes.<ref>"Next Generation Banknotes: Additional Feature for the Vision Impaired". www.rba.gov.au (Press release). Media Office-Reserve Bank of Australia. 13 February 2015.</ref> The tactile feature is an embossed feature to assist the [[Visual impairment|vision-impaired]] in identifying the denomination. A similar feature is used on the [[Canadian currency tactile feature|Canadian currency]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-18/13yo-blind-boy-successfully-campaigns-for-tactile-banknotes/6144262|title=RBA to introduce tactile banknotes after 13yo blind boy Connor McLeod campaigns for change|first= Nance|last= Haxton|accessdate=19 February 2015|date=19 February 2015|work= |publisher=ABC }}</ref>
