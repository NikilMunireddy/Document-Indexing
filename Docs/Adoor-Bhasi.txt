'''K. Bhaskaran Nair'''<ref>http://malayalam.webdunia.com/entertainment/film/profile/0803/30/1080330025_1.htm</ref> (1 March 1927 – 29 March 1990), known by his stage name '''Adoor Bhasi''', was an [[India]]n film actor and film director from [[Kerala]]. Adoor Bhasi was almost always cast as the man who stands next to the [[protagonist|hero]]. His hilarious actions and roles became the cynosure of comic scenes in the [[Malayalam films]] of the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He is also famous for his eloquent speeches in fluent English. He directed three Malayalam films during the late 1970s.<ref>http://www.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/malayalamContentView.do?contentId=13742595&programId=7940855&channelId=-1073750705&BV_ID=@@@&tabId=3</ref>

==Early life==

Adoor Bhasi was born on 1 March 1927 in Rosscote Bungalow, [[Vazhuthacaud]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the capital of the erstwhile native State of [[Travancore]] in [[South India]]. He had a rich lineage to boast of. His father, [[E. V. Krishna Pillai]], was a renowned Malayalam humourist writer, dramatist, pioneering short story writer and essayist, a lawyer and a Member of the then Travancore Legislative Assembly (M.L.C.). His mother, Maheshwari Amma, was the youngest daughter of [[C.V. Raman Pillai]], the greatest Malayalam novelist (the first historical novelist in Malayalam and author of ''[[Marthandavarma (novel)|Marthanda Varma]]'', ''Dharmaraja'', ''Premamritham'', and ''Ramarajabahadur''), pioneering dramatist, journalist and social activist.

Bhasi was the fourth son of his parents. His siblings (two sisters and four brothers) were the late Omana Amma, the late K. Ramachandran Nair alias Chandraji, Rajalakshmi Amma, K. Padmanabhan Nair, the late K. Sankaran Nair, who died young at the age of 18, and the late K. Krishnan Nair.<ref>http://malayalam.webdunia.com/entertainment/film/profile/0803/29/1080329025_1.htm</ref>

His elder brother Chandraji became a film actor much before him. Chandraji entered the Film world of [[Bollywood]] and acted in a few Hindi films ([[Bimal Roy]]'s ''Parineeta'' and [[Hrishikesh Mukherji]]'s films) before moving over with his family to [[Madras]] to live with Adoor Bhasi. Chandraji was the manager of RK Studios owned by Raj Kapoor in Mumbai and has acted as villain in the popular Bollywood film "Ashique" alongside Raj Kapoor. Chandraji then acted in several [[Malayalam film]]s like ''Chithram'' and became well known as an actor. His nephew, B. Harikumar, is a well-known Novelist, Satirist and Actor in Malayalam and has acted in several TV Serials and Feature Films.

Bhasi spent his childhood along with his parents in [[Trivandrum]]. He had his primary education in a missionary school—Vadakkekottaaram—in the capital city. After his father's premature death at the age of 44, Bhasi along with his mother and siblings moved to his father's native town of [[Adoor]] and had his middle and high school studies in the English High School of Adoor. After his school education, he moved over to Trivandrum and lived with his maternal aunt. He then joined the Institute of Textile Technology and passed the professional course of Diploma in Textile Chemistry. He did not attend any college for graduation. After acquiring the Diploma, he was to do internship in a Textile Mill in [[Coimbatore]] in Tamil Nadu but owing to financial difficulties, he could not pursue the prescribed internship. He then worked as an apprentice in the Lakshmi Textiles factory in Trivandrum but could not secure a job in any Textile Mill in Travancore. He stayed put in Trivandrum and while staying with his eldest maternal aunt, B. Gourikutty Amma, for more than 12 years in Rosscote Bungalow, the house built by his maternal grandfather, [[C. V. Raman Pillai]], began acting on the amateur stage and taking part in dramas broadcast by [[All India Radio]], Thrivananthapuram station, along with leading stage actors of the time like C. I. Parameswaran Pillai, [[Kainikkara Kumara Pillai]], P. K. Vikraman Nair, T. R. Sukumaran Nair, [[Jagathy N. K. Achary]], [[Nagavally R. S. Kurup]], [[Thikkurissy Sukumaran Nair]], P. K. Veeraraghavan Nair alias Veeran, T. N. Gopinathan Nair, [[Aranmula Ponnamma]], Mavelikara Ponnamma, and Pattom Saraswathi Amma.

During those twelve years, he also worked as the Manager of P. K. Memorial Press run by the well-known playwright, T. N. Gopinathan Nair, and also worked as the Manager of ''Sakhi'' weekly, edited by T. N. Gopinathan Nair, Rosscote Krishna Pillai and [[Kavalam Narayana Panicker]]. His friendship with T.N. earned for him many close contacts with writers and artistes in the professional world of Malayalam drama and films. That ultimately secured for him entry into the amateur stage and finally to the Malayalam film world.

==Career==
Bhasi got his first chance in an insignificant role in a Malayalam feature film, ''[[Thiramala]]'', directed by P.R.S. Pillai. His first notable film was Chandrathara's ''Mudiyanaya Puthran'' (1961). In the year 1968, he acted in ''[[Viruthan Shanku]]'', the first full-length comedy in Malayalam cinema by [[P. Venu]].  He went on to become one of the highly sought-after and inalienable actors and celebrities of Malayalam feature films of the 1960s and 1970s. He along with [[S. P. Pillai]] and [[Bahadoor|Bahadur]] formed the trio that contributed to rollicking comedy scenes in Malayalam films. Bhasi went on to act in over 2000 films.

He acted as the villain in ''Karimbana'' and ''Itha Oru Manushyan''. He did double roles in ''Kottaram Vilkkanundu'','' Bhadradeepam''  and ''Lankadahanam''. He got his first [[Kerala State Film Award]] for best actor in 1974 for ''Chattakkari''. He first acted as hero in [[John Abraham (director)|John Abraham]]'s ''[[Cheriyachante Kroorakrithyangal]]'' (1978) and got the Kerala State Film Award for best actor in 1979. Later in 1984, he won the [[Kerala State Film Award]] for best actor for his performance in ''April 18'' (1983). A memorial to Adoor Bhasi is being built by the District Panchayat of [[Pathanamthitta]], the foundation stone for which was laid on 12 June 2009.

A film based on Bhasi's real-life is in the making with Dileep playing the lead role. It is based on a novel by B. Harikumar (his nephew) called ''Mareecham''. The script work is by Harikumar himself and the film is produced and directed by Suku Menon. The location is planned out of Trivandrum and Adoor.

Adoor Bhasi is often considered one of the first film makers in South India to recognize the credentials of Kamal Hassan when he cast him as lead in his movie ''Adiyapadam'', Kamal later became one of the greatest stars India has ever produced.
