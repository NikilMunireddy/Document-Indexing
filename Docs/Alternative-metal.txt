Industrial metal lyrics also mirror the darkness and aggression of standard heavy metal, although the sensibility is filtered through the personal alienation of punk and alternative rock...In the wake of NIN's success, a number of similar-sounding bands popped up on alternative radio, and toward the end of the decade, a number of popular alternative metal bands appropriated industrial metal's electronic production touches into their hybrid of aggressive music styles.}}</ref>

At the same time, rap-metal began to draw influences from alternative metal -- specifically, bands like Helmet, White Zombie, and Tool, who relied on crushingly heavy sonic textures more than catchy songwriting or immediately memorable riffs. The thick sound and the lack of melodic emphasis fit rap-metal's concerns perfectly.

Jonathan Gold of the [[Los Angeles Times]] wrote in 1990 "Just as rock has an alternative, [left] wing-bands like the Replacements and Dinosaur Jr.-so does metal. Alternative metal is alternative music that rocks. And alternative metal these days can reach 10 times the audience of other alternative rock. Jane's Addiction plays an intense brand of '70s-influenced arty metal; so does Soundgarden. In fact, the arty meanderings of Sab and the Zep themselves would be considered alternative metal."<ref name="goldman">{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60060917.html?dids=60060917:60060917&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+26%2C+1990&author=JONATHAN+GOLD&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=Alternative+Metal+Bands+Follow+Zeppelin+Lead+Records%3A+New+releases+by+Mind+Over+Four%2C+Warrior+Soul%2C+Prong+and+Flotsam+and+Jetsam.&pqatl=google |title=Los Angeles Times: Archives - Alternative Metal Bands Follow Zeppelin Lead Records: New releases by Mind Over Four, Warrior Soul, Prong and Flotsam and Jetsam |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1990-05-26 |accessdate=2013-02-02}}</ref> [[Houston Press]] has described the genre as being a "compromise for people for whom Nirvana was not heavy enough but Metallica was too heavy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/rocks/2014/04/six_bands_you_didnt_know_were.php|title=Six Bands You Didn't Know Were Still Around|author=Corey Deiterman|work=Houston Press}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Helmet 2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|Influential alternative metal band [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]].]]
The origins of the genre can be traced back to [[funk rock]] music of the early to mid-1980s, when [[alternative rock|alternative]] bands like [[Fishbone]], [[Faith No More]] and the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] started mixing [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] with [[funk]], creating the alternative metal subgenre [[funk metal]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Funk Metal |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/funk-metal-ma0000012114 |title=Funk Metal : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref> Other early bands in the genre also came from [[hardcore punk]] backgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|author=Punk Metal |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/punk-metal-ma0000012022 |title=Punk Metal : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> Bands such as Faith No More, [[Jane's Addiction]] and [[Soundgarden]] are recognized as some of the earliest alternative metal acts, with all three of these bands emerging around the same time, and setting the template for the genre by mixing heavy metal music with a variety of different genres in the mid to late 1980s.<ref name="allmusic alt metal"/><ref>Sharpe-Young, Garry (2007).

Joel McIver believes that the band Tool is important to the development of this genre; he wrote in his book ''Unleashed: The Story of Tool'', "By 1996 and '97 the wave of alternative metal spearheaded by Tool in the wake of grunge was beginning to evolve into nu-metal". However, Tool's vocalist [[Maynard James Keenan]] was quick to separate himself from this movement saying "I'm sick of that whole attitude. The one that puts Tool in with [nu] metal bands.
