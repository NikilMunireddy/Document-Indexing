'''All Media Network''' (formerly All Media Guide (AMG) and AllRovi), is an American [[company (law)|company]] that owns and maintains [[AllMusic]], [[AllMovie]], [[AllGame]] (until its closure in 2014), [[SideReel]], and Celebified. The company was founded in 1990 by [[pop culture|popular-culture]] archivist [[Michael Erlewine]].

All Music Guide (now AllMusic) was launched in 1991.  Later in 1994 the All Movie Guide (now AllMovie) was launched and in 1998 the All Game Guide (now AllGame).<ref name="metro" />

== History ==
The company was founded in [[Big Rapids, Michigan]] in 1990 by Michael Erlewine.  With the All Music Guide the aim was to "[compile] discographic information on every artist who's made a record since Enrico Caruso gave the industry its first big boost", which launched in 1991.<ref name="wired" />

They expanded with the All Movie Guide (now [[AllMovie]]) in 1994, and then the All Game Guide (now [[AllGame]]) in 1998.  moved to [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] in 1999 to take advantage of the "rich talent pool".<ref name="metro" /> AMG was a business unit within [[Alliance Entertainment Corporation]] from 1996 until early 2005. Alliance was acquired in 1999 by [[Yucaipa Companies]], a multibillion-dollar fund based in California.

[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision (now Rovi)]] announced on November 6, 2007 that it had agreed to purchase All Media Guide for a reported $72 million.<ref name="BusinessWire" /><ref name="Mandasoft" /> For a time, all of the guides were controlled by Rovi's nameservers and combined access to the All Music and All Movie Guides was provided via AllRovi.com from 2011 until 2013. In 2013, Rovi sold consumer access of the content to the newly established All Media Network, LLC, but retained control of licensing the content to other businesses. The overall website is allmedianetwork.com (previously allmediaguide.com and allrovi.com).

Rovi sold the consumer access to them to newly established All Media Network, LLC in 2013, while retaining ownership and maintenance of the content itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rovicorp.com/company/press-releases/2013/7/31/rovicorp-reports-second-quarter-2013-financial-performance.html |title=Rovi Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2013 Financial Performance |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=July 31, 2013 |website=http://www.rovicorp.com |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref><ref name="faq">{{cite web |url=http://getsatisfaction.com/allmedianetwork/topics/whats_the_story_on_rovi |title=What's the Story on Rovi |last1=Zac |first1=Johnson |date=September 2013 |website=http://www.sidereel.com/topic/faq |accessdate=February 27, 2014}}</ref>
