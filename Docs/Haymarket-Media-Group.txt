==History==
Haymarket began as ''Cornmarket Press'' in the 1950s. Clive Labovitch and [[Michael Heseltine]] – later a minister under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and Deputy Prime Minister under [[John Major]] – who had met at university started out with the 1957 ''Directory of Opportunities for Graduates'' and in 1959 relaunched ''Man About Town'', which was to become an influential (if unprofitable) men's consumer magazine. The company failed in its relaunch of the British news weekly ''Topic'', the title closing at the end of 1962, within three months of the takeover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magforum.com/manabouttown.htm |title=Man About Town magazine: 1950s pioneer of men's sector|work=Magforum|accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref> The partners split in 1965, with Heseltine renaming his half of the business ''Haymarket Press'' to publish ''Management Today''.<ref>[http://www.ppa.co.uk/cgi-bin/wms.pl/705/ ''The Marcus Morris Award'', Periodical Publishers Association, London.
