'''Cook County''' is the [[List of the most populous counties in the United States|second-most populous]] county in the United States after [[Los Angeles County, California]]. The [[County (United States)|county]] is located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]]. As of 2014, the population was 5,246,456.<ref>United States Census Bureau, ''Quick Facts'', Internet website [http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/17/17031.html], accessed January 20, 2016.</ref> Its [[county seat]] is [[Chicago]], the largest city in Illinois and [[List of United States cities by population|third-most populous]] city in the United States. More than 40% of all residents of Illinois live in the county. 

Cook County's population is larger than that of 29 individual [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|U.S. states]] and the combined populations of the seven smallest states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2011/tables/CO-EST2011-01-17.csv |title=County Population Estimates |date= |accessdate=2014-04-04}}</ref> There are 135 incorporated municipalities partially or wholly within Cook County, the largest of which is Chicago, which is home to approximately 54% of the population of the county. That part of the county which lies outside of the Chicago city limits is divided into 30 townships. Geographically, the county is the fifth largest in Illinois by land area and shares the state's [[Lake Michigan]] shoreline with [[Lake County, Illinois|Lake County]]. Including its lake area, the county has a total area of {{convert|1635|sqmi|1}}, the largest county in Illinois, of which {{convert|945|sqmi|1}} is land and {{convert|690|sqmi|1}} (42.16%) is water. Cook County's land is mainly urban and very densely populated.

Cook County is included in the Chicago-[[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]]-[[Elgin, Illinois|Elgin]], IL-[[Indiana|IN]]-[[Wisconsin|WI]] [[Chicago metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. It is surrounded by the five [[collar counties]].

==History==
Cook County was created on January 15, 1831, out of [[Putnam County, Illinois|Putnam County]] by an act of the [[Illinois General Assembly]]. It was the 54th county established in Illinois and was named after [[Daniel Pope Cook|Daniel Cook]], one of the earliest and youngest statesmen in Illinois history, who served as the second [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from Illinois and the state's first [[Illinois Attorney General|Attorney General]]. In 1839, [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]] was carved out of Cook County.

==Government and politics==

===Government===
{{main|Government of Cook County, Illinois}}

The [[government]] of Cook County is primarily composed of the [[Cook County Board of Commissioners|Board of Commissioners]], other elected officials such as the [[Cook County Sheriff|Sheriff]], [[Cook County State's Attorney|State's Attorney]], Treasurer, Board of Review, Clerk, Assessor, Recorder, [[Illinois Circuit Court|Circuit Court]] judges, and Circuit Court Clerk, as well as numerous other officers and entities. Cook County is the only [[home rule]] county in Illinois.<ref>{{cite book|title=Illinois Politics and Government: The Expanding Metropolitan Frontier|first=Samuel Kimball|last=Gove|year=1996|series=Politics and Governments of the American States|page=156|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=0-8032-7014-3|lccn=95046017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JFP49qn_wUC&pg=PA156|ref=harv|accessdate=2014-04-04}}</ref> The ''Cook County Code'' is the [[codification (law)|codification]] of Cook County's [[local ordinance]]s. Cook County's current [[Cook County Board|County Board]] president is [[Toni Preckwinkle]].

The Circuit Court of Cook County, which is a State agency funded, in part, by Cook County, accepts more than 1.2 million cases each year for filing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cookcountycourt.net/publications/pdf/Informational-Guide.pdf |accessdate=December 16, 2008 |year=2008 |title=Circuit Court of Cook County an Informational Guide |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070301193357/http://www.cookcountycourt.net/publications/pdf/Informational-Guide.pdf |archivedate=March 1, 2007 }}</ref> The [[Cook County Jail|Cook County Department of Corrections]], also known as the [[Cook County Jail]], is the largest single-site jail in the nation. The Cook County Juvenile Detention Center, under the authority of the Chief Judge of the State court, is the first juvenile center in the nation and one of the largest in the nation. The Cook County Law Library is the second largest county law library in the nation. In the 1980s, Cook County was ground zero to an extensive [[FBI]] investigation called [[Operation Greylord]]. Ninety-two officials were indicted, including 17 judges, 48 lawyers, 8 policemen, 10 deputy sheriffs, 8 court officials, and a state legislator.

The Bureau of Health Services administers the county's public health services and is the third largest public health system in the nation. Three hospitals are part of this system: [[John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County]], [[Provident Hospital (Chicago)|Provident Hospital]], and [[Oak Forest Hospital of Cook County]], along with over 30 clinics.

The Cook County Department of Transportation is responsible for the design and maintenance of roadways in the county. These thoroughfares are mostly composed of major and minor arterials, with a few local roads. Although the [[Department of Transportation]] was instrumental in designing many of the expressways in the county, today they are under the jurisdiction of the state.

The [[Cook County Forest Preserves]], organized in 1915, is a separate, independent taxing body, but the Cook County Board of Commissioners also acts as its Board of Commissioners. The district is a belt of {{convert|69000|acre|km2}} of forest reservations surrounding the city of Chicago. The [[Brookfield Zoo]] (managed by the Chicago Zoological Society) and the [[Chicago Botanic Garden]] (managed by the Chicago Horticultural Society) are located in the forest preserves.

Cook County is the fifth largest employer in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-tax_blurb_bdmar02,0,2967710.story|accessdate=March 2, 2008|year=2008|work=Chicago Tribune|title=All the extra cost will be no small change}}</ref>

===Politics===
The county has more [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic Party]] members than any other Illinois county and is one of the most Democratic counties in the United States. It has voted only once for a [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican]] candidate in a Presidential election in the last 50 years, when county voters preferred [[Richard Nixon]] to [[George McGovern]] in 1972. The 1970 Illinois Constitution allows the controlling party to redraw voting districts; The Republican Party controlled the process through the 80's and 90's gerrymandering the state to their advantage. Since 2000 the Democratic Party won control [[gerrymandering]] to gain additional seats in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from Republicans in the 2012 election more effectively representing the demographics of the state.<ref name="slate1">{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/11/06/tammy_duckworth_defeats_joe_walsh_illinois_8th_district_has_a_new_representative.html|title=Tammy Duckworth Wins in Illinois, as Does Gerrymandering and Deadbeat-Dad Shaming|last=Howley|first=Kerry|date=November 6, 2012|work=Slate|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name="slate2">{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2012/11/the_supreme_court_may_gut_the_voting_rights_act_and_make_gerrymandering.html|title=It’s Appalling that Gerrymandering Is Legal|last=Bazelon|first=Emily|date=November 9, 2012|work=Slate|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref><ref name="csm1">{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2011/0608/Democrats-revenge-in-2012-a-radical-Illinois-gerrymander|title=Democrats' revenge in 2012: a radical Illinois gerrymander|last=Greenbaum|first=Mark|date=June 8, 2011|work=Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref> Nonetheless, Republicans are customarily represented by officeholders in certain districts.<ref>See, ''e.g.'', [[Cook County Board of Commissioners]].</ref>

The [[Cook County Democratic Party]] represents Democratic voters in 50 [[Ward (politics)|wards]] in the city of Chicago and 30 suburban [[townships]] of Cook County. The organization has dominated County, [[Political history of Chicago|city]], and [[Illinois politics|state]] politics since the 1930s. The last Republican mayor of Chicago was [[William Hale Thompson|William Hale "Big Bill" Thompson]], who left office in 1931 with a record of corruption. The [[High water mark#Metaphorical usage|high-water mark]] for Republican candidacies for mayor since then was that of Republican candidate [[Bernard Epton]], who in 1983 came within 3.3 percentage points of defeating Democrat [[Harold Washington]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/14/obituaries/bernard-e-epton-is-dead-at-66-ran-for-mayor-of-chicago-in-83.html | title=Bernard E.

In March 2008, the County Board increased the [[sales tax]] by one percent to 1.75 percent. This followed a quarter-cent increase in [[mass transit]] taxes. In Chicago, the rate increased to 10.25 percent, the steepest nominal rate of any major metropolitan area in America. In [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], sales tax reached 10 percent and [[Oak Lawn, Illinois|Oak Lawn]] residents pay 9.5 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-tax_blurb_bdmar02,0,2967710.story |work=ChicagoBusiness|title=Chicago's Largest Employers}}</ref> On July 22, 2008, the Cook County board voted against Cook County Commissioner's proposal to repeal the tax increase.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/clout_st/2008/07/cook-county-boa.html | title=Cook County Board 'rejects' sales tax increase repeal |work=Chicago Tribune | date=July 22, 2008 | accessdate=July 23, 2008}}</ref>

===Secession movements===
To establish more localized government control and policies which reflect the often different values and needs of large suburban sections of the sprawling county, several [[secession]] movements have been made over the years which called for certain townships or municipalities to form their own independent counties.

In the late 1970s, a movement started which proposed a separation of six northwest suburban townships, Cook County's [[panhandle]] ([[Barrington Township, Cook County, Illinois|Barrington]], [[Hanover Township, Cook County, Illinois|Hanover]], [[Palatine Township, Cook County, Illinois|Palatine]], [[Wheeling Township, Cook County, Illinois|Wheeling]], [[Schaumburg Township, Cook County, Illinois|Schaumburg]], and [[Elk Grove Township, Cook County, Illinois|Elk Grove]]) from Cook to form [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] County, in honor of the former U.S. president and Illinois resident.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/1977/ii770934.html |title=Carving another county out of Cook |first=Charles |last=Cleveland |journal=Illinois Issues |date=September 1977 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908070322/http://www.lib.niu.edu/ipo/1977/ii770934.html |archivedate=September 8, 2006 }}</ref> It is likely that [[Arlington Heights, Illinois|Arlington Heights]] would have been the county seat. This northwest suburban region of Cook is moderately [[American conservatism|conservative]] and has a population over 500,000. Local legislators, led by State Senator Dave Regnar, went so far as to propose it as official legislation in the [[Illinois House of Representatives|Illinois House]]. The legislation died, however, before coming to a vote.

In 2004, [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] Mayor Donald E. Peloquin organized a coalition of fifty-five south and southwest suburban municipalities to form a new county, also proposing the name ''Lincoln County''. The county would include everything south of [[Burbank, Illinois|Burbank]], stretching as far west as [[Orland Park, Illinois|Orland Park]], as far east as [[Calumet City, Illinois|Calumet City]], and as far south as [[Matteson, Illinois|Matteson]], covering an expansive area with a population of over one million residents. Peloquin argued that the south suburbs are often shunned by the city (although Chicago is not bound or required to do anything for other municipalities) and he blamed the Chicago-centric policies of Cook County for failing to jumpstart the somewhat-depressed south suburban local economy. Pending sufficient interest from local communities, Peloquin planned a petition drive to place a question regarding the secession on the general election ballot, but the idea was not met with success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=News&id=1780024 |title=Blue Island mayor wants to create "Lincoln County" |publisher=WLS-TV News (abc7chicago.com) |date=June 25, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629020726/http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=News&id=1780024 |archivedate=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>

Talk of secession from Cook County amongst some outlying communities again heated up in mid-2008 in response to a highly controversial 1% sales tax hike which has pushed the tax rates across the county communities up amongst the highest in the nation. Some border towns in particular had been outraged, as people can take their business across the county border (paying, for instance, 7% in Lake County instead of Palatine's 9.5%).<ref>[http://www.zip2tax.com/z2t_lookup.asp?inputZip=60067 PinPoint Sales Tax Lookup]. Zip2tax.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref>  The secession issue eventually died down from the nominal tax increase.

In 2011, two downstate Republican state representatives, [[Bill Mitchell (politician)|Bill Mitchell]] of the 87th district and [[Adam Brown (Illinois politician)|Adam Brown]] of the 101st district, proposed statehood for Cook County. Mitchell said that Chicago is "dictating its views" to the rest of the state and Brown added that Chicago "overshadows" the rest of Illinois.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sj-r.com/breaking/x1431167324/2-GOP-legislators-propose-separating-Cook-County-from-Illinois|title=2 GOP legislators propose separating Cook County from Illinois|publisher=SJ-R.com|date=November 22, 2011}} ''Cf.''
