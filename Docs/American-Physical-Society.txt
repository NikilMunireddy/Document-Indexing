The '''American Physical Society''' ('''APS''') is the world's largest organization of physicists. The Society publishes more than a dozen scientific journals, including the prestigious ''[[Physical Review]]'' and ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', and organizes more than twenty science meetings each year. APS is a member society of the [[American Institute of Physics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/aip/societies.html |title=AIP member societies |publisher=Aip.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-06}}</ref>

==History==
The American Physical Society was founded on May 20, 1899, when thirty-six physicists gathered at [[Columbia University]] for that purpose. They proclaimed the mission of the new Society to be "to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics", and in one way or another the APS has been at that task ever since. In the early years, virtually the sole activity of the APS was to hold scientific meetings, initially four per year. In 1913, the APS took over the operation of the ''[[Physical Review]],'' which had been founded in 1893 at [[Cornell University]], and [[Academic journal|journal]] publication became its second major activity. The ''Physical Review'' was followed by ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]'' in 1929 and by ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'' in 1958. Over the years, ''Phys. Rev.'' has subdivided into five separate sections as the fields of physics proliferated and the number of submissions grew.

In more recent years, the activities of the Society have broadened considerably. Stimulated by the increase in Federal funding in the period after the [[Second World War]], and even more by the increased public involvement of scientists in the 1960s, the APS is active in public and governmental affairs, and in the international physics community. In addition, the Society conducts extensive programs in education, [[science outreach]] (specifically [[Physics Outreach]]), and media relations. APS has 14 divisions and 11 topical groups covering all areas of physics research. There are 6 forums that reflect the interest of its 50,000 members<ref>{{cite web|title=APS Membership Soars Above 50,000 Benchmark|url=http://aps.org/publications/apsnews/201202/membership2012.cfm|work=American Physical Society|accessdate=24 January 2012}}</ref> in broader issues, and 9 sections organized by geographical region.

In 1999, APS Physics celebrated its centennial with the biggest-ever physics meeting in [[Atlanta]]. In 2005, APS took the lead role in United States participation in the [[World Year of Physics]], initiating several programs to broadly publicize physics during the 100th anniversary of [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[annus mirabilis]]. [[Einstein@Home]], one of the projects APS initiated during World Year of Physics, is an ongoing and popular [[distributed computing]] project.

===Name change proposal===
During the summer of 2005, the society conducted an electronic poll, in which the majority of APS members preferred the name ''American Physics Society''. The poll became the motivation for a proposal of a name change promised in the leadership election that year. However, because of legal issues, the planned name change was eventually abandoned by the APS Executive Board.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200511/name-change.cfm |title=Legal, Financial Issues Impact APS Name Change Decision |first=Ernie |last=Tretkoff |journal=APS News  |volume=14 |number=10 |date=November 2005 |publisher=American Physical Society |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>

To promote public recognition of APS as a physics society, while retaining the name American Physical Society, the APS Executive Board adopted a new logo incorporating the phrase "''APS Physics''."  General use of ''APS Physics'' to refer to APS or the American Physical Society is encouraged. The new ''APS Physics'' logo was designed by [[Kerry G. Johnson]].

Marvin Cohen, LBNL Faculty Senior Scientist, University Professor of Physics, University of California, Berkeley, who was APS President in November 2005, when the logo was approved by the Executive Board, said, "''I like the logo.  At least now when you are in an elevator at an APS meeting and someone looks at your badge, they won't ask you about sports.''"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200601/logo.cfm |title=What's in a Logo? |first=Ernie |last=Tretkoff |journal=APS News  |volume=15 |number=1 |date=January 2006|publisher=American Physical Society |accessdate=27 October 2015}}</ref>
