The fungal [[order (biology)|order]] '''Agaricales''', also known as '''gilled mushrooms''' (for their distinctive [[gill (mushroom)|gill]]s) or '''euagarics''', contains some of the most familiar types of [[mushrooms]]. The [[Order (biology)|order]] has 33 [[Extant taxon|extant]] [[family (biology)|families]], 413 [[genus|genera]], and over 13000 described [[species]],<ref name=Kirk2008/> along with five [[extinct]] genera known only from the fossil record.<ref name=Poinar2007/><ref name=Hibbett2003/>  They range from the ubiquitous [[Agaricus bisporus|common mushroom]] to the deadly [[Amanita virosa|destroying angel]] and the [[Psychedelics, Dissociatives and Deliriants|hallucinogen]]ic [[Amanita muscaria|fly agaric]] to the [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] [[Omphalotus olearius|jack-o-lantern mushroom]].

}}
In his three volumes of ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'' published between 1821 and 1832, [[Elias Fries]] put almost all of the fleshy, gill-forming mushrooms in the genus ''[[Agaricus]]''. He organized the large genus into "tribes", the names of many of which still exist as common genera of today. Fries later elevated several of these tribes to generic level, but later authors—including [[Claude-Casimir Gillet|Gillet]], [[Petter Karsten|Karsten]], [[Paul Kummer|Kummer]], [[Lucien Quélet|Quélet]], and [[Friedrich Staude|Staude]]—made most of the changes. Fries based his classification on macroscopic characters of the fruit bodies and color of the spore print. His system had been widely used as it had the advantage that many genera could be readily identified based on characters observable in the field. Fries's classification was later challenged when microscopic studies of basidiocarp structure, initiated by [[Victor Fayod|Fayod]] and [[Narcisse Théophile Patouillard|Patouillard]], demonstrated several of Fries's groupings were unnatural.<ref name=Kirk2008/> In more recent history, Rolf Singer's influential work ''The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', published in four editions spanning from 1951 to 1986, used both Fries's macroscopic characters and Fayod's microscopic characters to reorganize [[family (biology)|families]] and genera; his most recent classification included 230 genera within 18 families.<ref name=Singer1986/>  Singer treated three major groups within the Agaricales ''[[sensu lato]]'': the Agaricales ''sensu stricto'', [[Boletineae]], and [[Russulales]]. These groups are still accepted by modern treatments based on DNA analysis, as the euagarics clade, bolete clade, and russuloid clade.<ref name=Hibbett2001/>

[[Molecular phylogenetics]] research has demonstrated that the euagarics clade is roughly equivalent to Singer's Agaricales ''sensu stricto''.<ref name=Hibbett1997/><ref name=Moncalvo2000/><ref name=Moncalvo2002/> A recent (2006) large-scale study by Brandon Matheny and colleagues used [[nucleic acid sequence]]s representing six [[gene]] regions from 238 species in 146 genera to explore the phylogenetic grouping within the Agaricales. The analysis showed that most of the species tested could be grouped into six [[clade]]s that were named the Agaricoid, Tricholomatoid, Marasmioid, Pluteoid, Hygrophoroid and Plicaturopsidoid clades.<ref name=Matheny2006/>

Some notable fungi with gill-like structures, such as [[chanterelle]]s, have long been recognized as being substantially different from usual Agaricales. Molecular studies are showing more groups of agarics as being more divergent than previously thought, such as the genera ''[[Russula]]'' and ''[[Lactarius]]'' belonging to a separate order [[Russulales]], and other gilled fungi, including such species as ''[[Paxillus involutus]]'' and ''[[Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca]]'' showing a closer affinity with [[Bolete]]s in the order [[Boletales]].

Also, some other quite distinctive fungi, the [[puffball]]s, and some clavaroid fungi, e.g. ''[[Typhula]]'', and the [[Fistulina hepatica|Beefsteak fungus]] have been recently been shown to lie within the Agaricales.

The term [[agaric]] had traditionally referred to Agaricales, which were defined as exactly those fungi with [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]]. Given the discoveries described above, those two categories are not synonymous (although there is a very large overlap between the two groups).

==Distribution and habitat==
Agarics are ubiquitous, being found across all continents. Most are terrestrial, their habitats including all types of woodland and grassland, varying largely from one genus to another. Agarics were long thought to be solely terrestrial, until the 2005 discovery of ''[[Psathyrella aquatica]]'', the only gilled mushroom known to fruit underwater.<ref name=Frank2010/>

Agaricals are known from five [[monotypic]] genera found fossilized in [[amber]].  The oldest records are from two [[Cretaceous]] age genera; the [[Albian]] age (approximately 100 [[Mya (unit)|Ma]]) ''[[Palaeoagaracites|Palaeoagaracites antiquus]]'' from [[Burmese amber]] and the slightly younger [[Turonian]] [[New Jersey Amber]] species ''[[Archaeomarasmius|Archaeomarasmius leggeti]]''.<ref name="Poinar2007"/>  The three other species,  ''[[Aureofungus|Aureofungus yaniguaensis]]'', ''[[Coprinites|Coprinites dominicana]]'' and ''[[Protomycena|Protomycena electra]]'' are known from single specimens found in the [[Dominican amber]] mines of  [[Hispaniola]].<ref name=Hibbett2003/>
[[File:Cortinarius archeri.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Cortinarius archeri]]'']]

==Characteristics==
[[Basidiocarp]]s of the agarics are typically fleshy, with a [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], often called a stem or stalk, a [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] (or cap) and [[Lamella (mycology)|lamella]]e (or gills), where [[basidiospore]]s are produced. This is the stereotypical structure of a [[mushroom]].

==Life cycle==
The fungus fruit body is the spore-producing stage of the [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]. Most fungi reproduce by spores and the fruit bodies are developed specifically for the production and dispersal of spores. The spores produced by fruit bodies are usually the result of [[sexual reproduction]].<ref name=Alexopolous1996>Alexopolous ''et al.'', pp. 508–43.</ref>

The fruit body is the visible part of the growing fungus. It is supported by and develops from an extensive network of thread-like filaments called [[hypha]]e. Hyphae are often collectively termed the [[mycelium]]; the food-absorbing part of the fungus—as opposed to the spore-producing fruit body of the fungus—is called the vegetative mycelium. The individual hyphae that compose the mycelium absorb nutrients and water from the substratum in which they are growing. When the nutrient supply is adequate and environmental conditions are favorable, some fungi may grow in the same location for several years. Fungi cannot make their own food, namely [[carbohydrate]]s, as can green plants. Some species are [[saprobic]], obtaining nutrients from dead [[organic matter|organic material]], whereas others are [[parasitism|parasitic]] on living plants or animals or even on other fungi. Many fungi, especially gilled mushroomes and boletes, have an extensive mycelium that lives in association with the roots of woody plants. This association, which is beneficial to both the fungus and host plant, is termed a [[mycorrhiza]].<ref name=Alexopolous1996/>

When the environmental conditions are favorable and the mycelium is at the proper stage of development, one or more fruit bodies are produced by the fungus. The actual conditions necessary for fruit body formation and spore production are not clearly understood. [[Humidity]], light, temperature, aeration, and nutrition are all factors thought to be important in fruit body formation. The genetic makeup and the general physiology of the fungus hyphae are also important in the initiation and formation of young fruit bodies and their development to a mature stage. The spores produced by a fruit body are released when it is mature. When they land in a suitable environment, the spores germinate and the hyphae grow to initiate the life cycle anew.<ref name=Alexopolous1996/>

==Genera ''Incertae sedis''==
[[File:Setchelliogaster 92786.jpg|thumb|''Setchelliogaster'' is a genus of [[gasteroid fungi]] in the Agaricales that is ''incertae sedis'' with respect to familial placement.]]
There are several genera classified in the Agaricales that are i) poorly known, ii) have not been subjected to DNA analysis, or iii) if analysed phylogenetically do not group with as yet named or identified families, and have not been assigned to a specific family (i.e., ''[[Incertae sedis]]'' with respect to familial placement).
