'''Henry I''' (c. 1068&nbsp;– 1 December 1135), also known as '''Henry Beauclerc''', was [[King of England]] from 1100 to his death. Henry was the fourth son of [[William the Conqueror]] and was educated in [[Latin]] and the [[liberal arts]]. On William's death in 1087, Henry's elder brothers [[Robert Curthose]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]] inherited [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and England, respectively, but Henry was left landless. Henry purchased the [[Cotentin|County of Cotentin]] in western Normandy from Robert, but William and Robert deposed him in 1091. Henry gradually rebuilt his power base in the Cotentin and allied himself with William against Robert. Henry was present when William died in a hunting accident in 1100, and he seized the English throne, promising at his coronation to correct many of William's less popular policies. Henry married [[Matilda of Scotland]] but continued to have a large number of mistresses, by whom he had many illegitimate children.

Robert, who invaded in 1101, disputed Henry's control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. The peace was short-lived, and Henry invaded the Duchy of Normandy in 1105 and 1106, finally defeating Robert at the [[Battle of Tinchebray]]. Henry kept Robert imprisoned for the rest of his life. Henry's control of Normandy was challenged by [[Louis VI of France]], [[Baldwin VII, Count of Flanders|Baldwin of Flanders]] and [[Fulk, King of Jerusalem|Fulk of Anjou]], who promoted the rival claims of Robert's son, [[William Clito]], and supported a major rebellion in the Duchy between 1116 and 1119. Following Henry's victory at the [[Battle of Brémule]], a favourable peace settlement was agreed with Louis in 1120.

Considered by contemporaries to be a harsh but effective ruler, Henry skilfully manipulated the barons in England and Normandy. In England, he drew on the existing [[Anglo-Saxon]] system of justice, local government and taxation, but also strengthened it with additional institutions, including the royal [[exchequer]] and itinerant [[judge|justices]]. Normandy was also governed through a growing system of justices and an exchequer. Many of the officials who ran Henry's system were "new men" of obscure backgrounds rather than from families of high status, who rose through the ranks as administrators. Henry encouraged [[Gregorian Reform|ecclesiastical reform]], but became embroiled in a serious dispute in 1101 with Archbishop [[Anselm of Canterbury]], which was resolved through a compromise solution in 1105. He supported the [[Cluniac]] order and played a major role in the selection of the senior clergy in England and Normandy.

Henry's only legitimate son and heir, [[William Adelin]], drowned in the ''[[White Ship]]'' disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry took a second wife, [[Adeliza of Louvain|Adeliza]], in the hope of having another son, but their marriage was childless. In response to this, Henry declared his daughter, [[Empress Matilda|Matilda]], his heir and married her to [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]]. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with Anjou. Henry died on 1 December 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew, [[Stephen of England|Stephen of Blois]], resulting in a period of civil war known as [[the Anarchy]].

==Early life, 1068–1099==
===Childhood and appearance, 1068–86===
Henry was probably born in England in 1068, in either the summer or the last weeks of the year, possibly in the town of [[Selby]] in [[Yorkshire]].<ref name=HollisterGreenP20>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=30–31}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=20}}</ref>{{refn|The dating of Henry's birth depends on comparing chronicler accounts and the various travels of his parents William and Matilda; these give only limited periods in which Henry could have been conceived and born. Historian Warren Hollister prefers the summer of 1068, Judith Green the end of the year, although it is just possible that Henry could have been born in early 1069. The possible birthplace of Selby is based upon a local tradition.<ref name=HollisterGreenP20/>|group=nb}} His father was [[William the Conqueror|William]], who had originally been the [[Duke of Normandy]] and then, following the [[Norman invasion of England|invasion of 1066]], became the [[King of England]], with lands stretching into [[Wales]]. The invasion had created an Anglo-Norman elite, many with estates spread across both sides of the [[English Channel]].<ref>{{harvnb|Newman|1988|pp=21–22}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=125–126}}</ref> These Anglo-Norman barons typically had close links to the [[kingdom of France]], which was then a loose collection of counties and smaller polities, under only the minimal control of the king.<ref>{{harvnb|Hallam|Everard|2001|pp=62–64, 114–118}}</ref> Henry's mother, [[Matilda of Flanders]], was the granddaughter of [[Robert II of France]], and she probably named Henry after her uncle, King [[Henry I of France]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=32, 40}}</ref>

Henry was the youngest of William and Matilda's four sons. Physically he resembled his older brothers [[Robert Curthose]], [[Richard, Duke of Bernay|Richard]] and [[William II of England|William Rufus]], being, as historian David Carpenter describes, "short, stocky and barrel-chested," with black hair.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=128}}</ref> As a result of their age differences and Richard's early death, Henry would have probably seen relatively little of his older brothers.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=21}}</ref> He probably knew his sister, [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]], well, as the two were close in age.<ref>{{harvnb|Newman|1988|p=54}}</ref> There is little documentary evidence for his early years; historians [[C. Warren Hollister|Warren Hollister]] and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England, while [[Judith Green (historian)|Judith Green]] argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=35}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|2007|pp=16–17}}.</ref>{{refn|The chronicler Orderic Vitalis describes a colourful quarrel that is said to have occurred between Henry and his brothers Robert and William Rufus in the town of [[l'Aigle]]; modern historians, including Judith Green and Warren Hollister, are inclined to doubt the veracity of the story.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=21}}; {{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=35–36}}</ref>|group=nb}} He was probably educated by the Church, possibly by [[Osmund (bishop of Salisbury)|Bishop Osmund]], the King's [[chancellor]], at [[Salisbury Cathedral]]; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to become a member of the clergy.<ref name=HollisterGreeenPP36P22>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=36–37}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=22}}</ref>{{refn|Historian Warren Hollister doubts that Henry was ever destined for the clergy; Judith Green is less certain.<ref name=HollisterGreeenPP36P22/>|group=nb}} It is also uncertain how far Henry's education extended, but he was probably able to read [[Latin]] and had some background in the [[liberal arts]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=33–34}}</ref> He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard, and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=37}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=23}}</ref>

===Inheritance, 1087–88===
[[File:Henry I of England.jpg|thumb|alt=13th century picture|13th-century depiction of Henry]]
In 1087, William was fatally injured during a campaign in the [[Vexin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=37}}</ref> Henry joined his dying father near [[Rouen]] in September, where the King partitioned his possessions among his sons.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=37–38}}</ref> The rules of succession in western Europe at the time were uncertain; in some parts of France, [[primogeniture]], in which the eldest son would inherit a title, was growing in popularity.<ref name=BarlowP162>{{harvnb|Barlow|1999|p=162}}</ref> In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the eldest son taking patrimonial lands – usually considered to be the most valuable – and younger sons given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates.<ref name=BarlowP162/>

In dividing his lands, William appears to have followed the Norman tradition, distinguishing between Normandy, which he had inherited, and England, which he had acquired through war.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=38}}</ref> William's second son, Richard, had died in a hunting accident, leaving Henry and his two brothers to inherit William's estate. Robert, the eldest, despite being in armed rebellion against his father at the time of his death, received Normandy.<ref name=Hollister2003pp38>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=38–39}}</ref> England was given to William Rufus, who was in favour with the dying king.<ref name=Hollister2003pp38/> Henry was given a large sum of money, usually reported as £5,000, with the expectation that he would also be given his mother's modest set of lands in [[Buckinghamshire]] and [[Gloucestershire]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=39–40, 46}}</ref>{{refn|Chroniclers varied in reporting the sum as either £2,000 or £5,000, although £5,000 is the more commonly cited figure amongst later historians.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=39}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=25}}</ref>|group=nb}} William's funeral at [[Caen]] was marred by angry complaints from a local man, and Henry may have been responsible for resolving the dispute by buying off the protester with silver.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=39}}</ref>

Robert returned to Normandy, expecting to have been given both the Duchy and England, to find that William Rufus had crossed the Channel and been crowned king, as William II.<ref name=Hollister2003P48>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=48}}</ref> The two brothers disagreed fundamentally over the inheritance, and Robert soon began to plan an invasion of England to seize the kingdom, helped by a rebellion by some of the leading nobles against William Rufus.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=48–49}}</ref> Henry remained in Normandy and took up a role within Robert's court, possibly either because he was unwilling to openly side with William Rufus, or because Robert might have taken the opportunity to confiscate Henry's inherited money if he had tried to leave.<ref name=Hollister2003P48/>{{refn|£5,000 would have formed around 1.5 million silver pennies, a difficult sum to move easily out of the Duchy if opposed.<ref>{{harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=17}}</ref>|group=nb}} William Rufus sequestered Henry's new estates in England, leaving Henry landless.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=40, 47}}</ref>

In 1088, Robert's plans for the invasion of England began to falter, and he turned to Henry, proposing that his brother lend him some of his inheritance, which Henry refused.<ref name=HollisterP49>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=49}}</ref> Henry and Robert then came to an alternative arrangement, in which Robert would make Henry the count of western Normandy, in exchange for £3,000.<ref name=HollisterP49/>{{refn|Western Normandy had originally been intended for Henry's late brother Richard, and was suitably remote from the capital in Rouen.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=28}}</ref>|group=nb}} Henry's lands were a new countship based around a delegation of the ducal authority in the [[Cotentin]], but it extended across the [[Avranchin]], with control over the bishoprics of both.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=51–53}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|2007|p=19}}</ref> This also gave Henry influence over two major Norman leaders, [[Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester|Hugh d'Avranches]] and [[Richard de Redvers]], and the abbey of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], whose lands spread out further across the Duchy.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=53}}</ref> Robert's invasion force failed to leave Normandy, leaving William Rufus secure in England.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=50}}</ref>

===Count of the Cotentin, 1088–90===
[[File:Odo bayeux tapestry.png||thumb|Depiction of [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Bishop Odo]] (centre) who imprisoned Henry from 1088–89]]
Henry quickly established himself as count, building up a network of followers from western Normandy and eastern Brittany, whom historian [[John Le Patourel]] has characterised as "Henry's gang".<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=56–58, 61}}</ref> His early supporters included Roger of Mandeville, Richard of Redvers, [[Richard d'Avranches, 2nd Earl of Chester|Richard d'Avranches]] and [[Robert Fitzhamon]], along with the churchman [[Roger of Salisbury]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=57–59}}</ref> Robert attempted to go back on his deal with Henry and re-appropriate the county, but Henry's grip was already sufficiently firm to prevent this.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=56}}</ref> Robert's rule of the Duchy was chaotic, and parts of Henry's lands became almost independent of central control from Rouen.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=54}}</ref>

During this period, neither William nor Robert seems to have trusted Henry.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=29}}</ref> Waiting until the rebellion against William Rufus was safely over, Henry returned to England in July 1088.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=61}}</ref> He met with the King but was unable to persuade him to grant him his mother's estates, and travelled back to Normandy in the autumn.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=62}}</ref> While he had been away, however, [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Odo]], the [[Bishop of Bayeux]], who regarded Henry as a potential competitor, had convinced Robert that Henry was conspiring against the duke with William Rufus.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=65}}</ref> On landing, Odo seized Henry and imprisoned him in [[Neuilly-la-Forêt]], and Robert took back the county of the Cotentin.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=65–66}}</ref> Henry was held there over the winter, but in the spring of 1089 the senior elements of the Normandy nobility prevailed upon Robert to release him.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=66–68}}</ref>

Although no longer formally the Count of Cotentin, Henry continued to control the west of Normandy.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=68}}</ref> The struggle between Henry's brothers continued. William Rufus continued to put down resistance to his rule in England, but began to build a number of alliances against Robert with barons in Normandy and neighbouring Ponthieu.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=6–69}}</ref> Robert allied himself with [[Philip I of France]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=69}}</ref> In late 1090 William Rufus encouraged Conan Pilatus, a powerful burgher in Rouen, to rebel against Robert; Conan was supported by most of Rouen and made appeals to the neighbouring ducal garrisons to switch allegiance as well.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=70}}</ref>

Robert issued an appeal for help to his barons, and Henry was the first to arrive in Rouen in November.<ref name=Hollister2003P71>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=71}}</ref> Violence broke out, leading to savage, confused street fighting as both sides attempted to take control of the city.<ref name=Hollister2003P71/> Robert and Henry left the castle to join the battle, but Robert then retreated, leaving Henry to continue the fighting.<ref name=Hollister2003P72>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=72}}</ref> The battle turned in favour of the ducal forces and Henry took Conan prisoner.<ref name=Hollister2003P72/> Henry was angry that Conan had turned against his feudal lord. He had him taken to the top of Rouen Castle and then, despite Conan's offers to pay a huge ransom, threw him off the top of the castle to his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=73}}</ref> Contemporaries considered Henry to have acted appropriately in making an example of Conan, and Henry became famous for his exploits in the battle.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=74–76}}</ref>

===Fall and rise, 1091–99===
[[File:Mont St Michel 3, Brittany, France - July 2011.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Mont St Michel|[[Mont Saint-Michel]], site of the 1091 siege]]
In the aftermath, Robert forced Henry to leave Rouen, probably because Henry's role in the fighting had been more prominent than his own, and possibly because Henry had asked to be formally reinstated as the count of the Cotentin.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=76}}</ref> In early 1091, William Rufus invaded Normandy with a sufficiently large army to bring Robert to the negotiating table.<ref name=Hollister2003PP76>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=76–77}}</ref> The two brothers signed a treaty at Rouen, granting William Rufus a range of lands and castles in Normandy. In return, William Rufus promised to support Robert's attempts to regain control of the neighbouring county of Maine, once under Norman control, and help in regaining control over the Duchy, including Henry's lands.<ref name=Hollister2003PP76/> They nominated each other as heirs to England and Normandy, excluding Henry from any succession while either one of them lived.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=77}}</ref>

War now broke out between Henry and his brothers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=78–79}}</ref> Henry mobilised a mercenary army in the west of Normandy, but as William Rufus and Robert's forces advanced, his network of baronial support melted away.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=79}}</ref> Henry focused his remaining forces at [[Mont Saint-Michel]], where he was besieged, probably in March 1091.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=80}}</ref> The site was easy to defend, but lacked fresh water.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=80–81}}</ref> The chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] suggested that when Henry's water ran short, Robert allowed his brother fresh supplies, leading to remonstrations between Robert and William Rufus.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=81–82}}</ref> The events of the final days of the siege are unclear: the besiegers had begun to argue about the future strategy for the campaign, but Henry then abandoned Mont Saint-Michel, probably as part of a negotiated surrender.<ref name=HollisterP82GreenP32>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=82}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=32}}</ref>{{refn|Chroniclers vary in their description of the length of the siege, suggesting either a duration of 15 days and six weeks. Warren Hollister prefers six weeks; Judith Green, 15 days.<ref name=HollisterP82GreenP32/>|group=nb}} He left for Brittany and crossed over into France.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=82–83}}</ref>

Henry's next steps are not well documented; one chronicler, [[Orderic Vitalis]], suggests that he travelled in the French Vexin, along the Normandy border, for over a year with a small band of followers.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=82}}</ref> By the end of the year, Robert and William Rufus had fallen out once again, and the Treaty of Rouen had been abandoned.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=85}}</ref> In 1092, Henry and his followers seized the Normandy town of [[Domfront, Orne|Domfront]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=85–86}}</ref> Domfront had previously been controlled by [[Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|Robert of Bellême]], but the inhabitants disliked his rule and invited Henry to take over the town, which he did in a bloodless coup.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=86–88}}</ref> Over the next two years, Henry re-established his network of supporters across western Normandy, forming what Judith Green terms a "court in waiting".<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=33}}; {{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=89}}</ref> By 1094, he was allocating lands and castles to his followers as if he were the Duke of Normandy.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=89}}</ref> William Rufus began to support Henry with money, encouraging his campaign against Robert, and Henry used some of this to construct a [[Château de Domfront|substantial castle]] at Domfront.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=90–91}}</ref>

William Rufus crossed into Normandy to take the war to Robert in 1094, and when progress stalled, called upon Henry for assistance.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=96}}</ref> Henry responded, but travelled to London instead of joining the main campaign further east in Normandy, possibly at the request of the King, who in any event abandoned the campaign and returned to England.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=96–97}}</ref>{{refn|Henry's decision not to join the main campaign may have been because Robert's forces were sufficiently strong to prevent him joining William Rufus at Eu.<ref name=Green2009P35>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=35}}</ref>|group=nb}} Over the next few years, Henry appears to have strengthened his power base in western Normandy, visiting England occasionally to attend at William Rufus's court.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=99}}</ref> In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called the [[First Crusade]], encouraging knights from across Europe to join.<ref name=Green2009P35/> Robert joined the Crusade, borrowing money from William Rufus to do so, and granting the King temporary custody of his part of the Duchy in exchange.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=36}}</ref> The King appeared confident of regaining the remainder of Normandy from Robert, and Henry appeared ever closer to William Rufus, the pair campaigning together in the Norman Vexin between 1097 and 1098.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=98–101}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=36–37}}</ref>

[[File:Coronation of henry i.png|thumb|upright|alt=Claudius Pontificals|A 17th-century [[Claudius Pontificals|manuscript]] drawing of Henry's coronation.]]
Henry became King of England following the death of William Rufus, who had been shot while hunting.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=102}}</ref> On the afternoon of 2 August 1100, the King had gone hunting in the [[New Forest]], accompanied by a team of huntsmen and a number of the Norman nobility, including Henry.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=102–103}}</ref> An arrow was fired, possibly by the baron Walter Tirel, which hit and killed William Rufus.<ref name=Hollister2003P103>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=103}}</ref> Numerous conspiracy theories have been put forward suggesting that the King was killed deliberately; most modern historians reject these, as hunting was a risky activity, and such accidents were common.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=103–104}}; {{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=134}}; Green pp.39–41.</ref>{{refn|David Carpenter regards William Rufus's death as "almost certainly an accident"; Warren Hollister considers "by far the likeliest explanation for the killing is simply&nbsp;... that it was a hunting accident"; Judith Green argues that "on balance it seems most likely that Rufus died because of an accident". Emma Mason is more suspicious, giving credence to the theory that William Rufus was murdered, either by Henry or by agents of the French King. The minority view was also held by Austin Poole, who considered Henry a "usurper"; writing earlier in the 20th century, he argued that the facts "look ugly" - in particular Tirel's departure from the scene, Henry's potential motive and apparent disregard for his brother - and "seem to suggest a plot.".<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|p=134}}; {{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=104}}; {{harvnb|Mason|2008|pp=228–231}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=41}}; {{harvnb|Poole|1993|pp=113–114}}</ref>|group=nb}} Chaos broke out, and Tirel fled the scene for France, either because he had fired the fatal shot, or because he had been incorrectly accused and feared that he would be made a scapegoat for the King's death.<ref name=Hollister2003P103/>

On one hand, the symbolism and homage was important to him; on the other hand, he needed Anselm's support in his struggle with his brother Duke Robert.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=53}}</ref>

Anselm stuck firmly to the letter of the papal decree, despite Henry's attempts to persuade him to give way in return for a vague assurance of a future royal compromise.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Vaughn|2007|p=142}}</ref> Matters escalated, with Anselm going back into exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Vaughn|2007|p=142}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=84–88}}; {{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=196}}</ref> A distinction was drawn between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained the custom of requiring them to come and do homage for the [[temporalities]], the landed properties they held in England.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=196}}</ref> Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.<ref>{{harvnb|Vaughn|2007|pp=139–140, 144}}</ref>

A long-running dispute between the Archbishops of Canterbury and York flared up under Anselm's successor, [[Ralph d'Escures]].<ref name=MayrHarting2001PP58>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|pp=58–59}}</ref> Canterbury, traditionally the senior of the two establishments, had long argued that the Archbishop of York should formally promise to obey their Archbishop, but York argued that the two episcopates were independent within the English Church and that no such promise was necessary. Henry supported the primacy of Canterbury, to ensure that England remained under a single ecclesiastical administration, but the Pope preferred the case of York.<ref name=MayrHarting2001PP58/> The matter was complicated by Henry's personal friendship with [[Thurstan]], the Archbishop of York, and the King's desire that the case should not end up in a papal court, beyond royal control.<ref name=MayrHarting2001PP58/> Henry badly needed the support of the Papacy in his struggle with Louis of France, however, and therefore allowed Thurstan to attend the Council of Rheims in 1119, where Thurstan was then consecrated by the Pope with no mention of any duty towards Canterbury.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|pp=61–62}}</ref> Henry believed that this went against assurances Thurstan had previously made and exiled him from England until the King and Archbishop came to a negotiated solution the following year.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|p=62}}; {{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=272–273}}</ref>

Even after the investiture dispute, the King continued to play a major role in the selection of new English and Norman bishops and archbishops.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=262–265}}</ref> Henry appointed many of his officials to bishoprics and, as historian Martin Brett suggests, "some of his officers could look forward to a mitre with all but absolute confidence".<ref>{{harvnb|Brett|1975|p=106}}</ref> Henry's chancellors, and those of his queens, became bishops of Durham, Hereford, London, Lincoln, Winchester and Salisbury.<ref>{{harvnb|Brett|1975|pp=106–107}}</ref> Henry increasingly drew on a wider range of these bishops as advisors – particularly Roger of Salisbury – breaking with the earlier tradition of relying primarily on the Archbishop of Canterbury.<ref>{{harvnb|Vaughn|2007|p=148}}</ref> The result was a cohesive body of administrators through which Henry could exercise careful influence, holding general councils to discuss key matters of policy.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=371, 379}}; {{harvnb|Brett|1975|pp=110–111}}</ref> This stability shifted slightly after 1125, when Henry began to inject a wider range of candidates into the senior positions of the Church, often with more reformist views, and the impact of this generation would be felt in the years after Henry's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Brett|1975|pp=111–112}}</ref>

====Personal beliefs and piety====
[[File:Reading Abbey 03.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of Reading Abbey|The ruined chapter house of [[Reading Abbey]] in 2008]]
Like other rulers of the period, Henry donated to the Church and patronised various religious communities, but contemporary chroniclers did not consider him an unusually pious king.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=14}}</ref> His personal beliefs and piety may, however, have developed during the course of his life. Henry had always taken an interest in religion, but in his later years he may have become much more concerned about spiritual affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|pp=44–45}}; {{harvnb|Brett|1975|p=112}}</ref> If so, the major shifts in his thinking would appear to have occurred after 1120, when his son William Adelin died, and 1129, when his daughter's marriage teetered on the verge of collapse.<ref>{{harvnb|Brett|1975|p=112}}</ref>{{refn|Assessing Henry's personal attitude towards religion later in his life is challenging. Historian Richard Southern argued in favour of the two shifts being in 1120 and 1129, although Martin Brett dismissed 1120 as a probable date, preferring 1129 as the key date. Judith Green is more cautious, observing that the fashion among chroniclers during the later period was to focus more of their writing on the themes of repenting and confession, and this may have given a false impression of a shift in Henry's thinking. Henry Mayr-Harting also doubts the extent of the evidence for a mid-life change, but draws out more of his earlier piety, suggesting that Henry was always more religiously inclined than was once thought.<ref>{{harvnb|Mayr-Harting|2011|pp=46}}; {{harvnb|Southern|1962|pp=155, 163}}, cited in {{harvnb|Brett|1975|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=282}}</ref>|group=nb}}

As a proponent of religious reform, Henry gave extensively to reformist groups within the Church.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=277–280}}</ref> He was a keen supporter of the [[Cluniac order]], probably for intellectual reasons.<ref name=Green2009P278>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=278}}</ref> He donated money to the abbey at Cluny itself, and after 1120 gave generously to Reading Abbey, a Cluniac establishment.<ref name=Green2009P278/> Construction on Reading began in 1121, and Henry endowed it with rich lands and extensive privileges, making it a symbol of his dynastic lines.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=435–438}}</ref> He also focused effort on promoting the conversion of communities of clerks into Augustinian canons, the foundation of [[leper hospital]]s, expanding the provision of nunneries, and the charismatic orders of the [[Congregation of Savigny|Savigniacs]] and [[Tironensian Order|Tironensians]].<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=278–280}}</ref> He was an avid collector of relics, sending an embassy to Constantinople in 1118 to collect Byzantine items, some of which were donated to Reading Abbey.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=14}}; {{harvnb|Bethell|1971|p=69}}</ref>

He may have considered [[Stephen, King of England|Stephen of Blois]] as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to a wealthy heiress, [[Matilda of Boulogne|Matilda]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=310}}</ref> Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=168}}</ref> William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=312–313}}</ref> Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=311–312}}</ref>

Henry's plans shifted when the Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=396}}</ref> King Henry recalled his daughter to England the next year and declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor.<ref name=Hollister2003P309>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=309}}</ref> The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.<ref name=Hollister2003P309/>{{refn|Medieval chroniclers' accounts of this oath vary on the points of detail. William of Malmesbury described that those present recognised Matilda as the legitimate heir on the basis of her paternal and maternal royal descent; [[John of Worcester]] described the inheritance of England as being conditional on Matilda having a legitimate male heir; the Anglo-Saxon chronicle suggested that an oath was given concerning the inheritance of both England and Normandy; neither Orderic or Henry of Huntingdon recorded the event at all. Some chronicler accounts may have been influenced by Stephen's acquisition of the throne in 1135 and the later events of the Anarchy.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=193–194}}</ref>|group=nb}} Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=318}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=191}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==

===Death, 1135===
[[File:Henry I - British Library Royal 20 A ii f6v (detail).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Picture of Henry|Early 14th-century depiction of Henry mourning the death of his son]]
Relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained during the King's final years. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England. In 1135 they urged Henry to hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive, and insisted that the Norman nobility swear immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a more powerful position after Henry's death.<ref>{{harvnb|King|2010|pp=38–39}}</ref> Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=216–217}}; {{harvnb|King|2010|p=38}}; {{harvnb|Crouch|2008|p=162}}</ref> A fresh rebellion broke out amongst the barons in southern Normandy, led by [[William III, Count of Ponthieu|William]], the [[Count of Ponthieu]], whereupon Geoffrey and Matilda intervened in support of the rebels.<ref>{{harvnb|Barlow|1999|p=162}}; {{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=467}}</ref>

Henry campaigned throughout the autumn, strengthening the southern frontier, and then travelled to [[Lyons-la-Forêt]] in November to enjoy some hunting, still apparently healthy.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=467, 473}}</ref> There Henry fell ill&nbsp;– according to the chronicler [[Henry of Huntingdon]], he ate a number of [[lamprey]]s against his physician's advice&nbsp;– and his condition worsened over the course of a week.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=467–468, 473}}</ref> Once the condition appeared terminal, Henry gave confession and summoned Archbishop [[Hugh of Amiens]], who was joined by Robert of Gloucester and other members of the court.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|p=473}}</ref> In accordance with custom, preparations were made to settle Henry's outstanding debts and to revoke outstanding sentences of forfeiture.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=467, 473}}; {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=220}}</ref> The King died on 1 December 1135, and his corpse was taken to Rouen accompanied by the barons, where it was embalmed; his entrails were buried locally at [[Port-du-Salut Abbey]], and the preserved body was taken on to England, where it was interred at Reading Abbey.<ref>{{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=467, 474}}</ref>

Despite Henry's efforts, the succession was disputed. When news began to spread of the King's death, Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda's supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.<ref name=BarlowP162/> Many of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late king was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England.<ref>{{harvnb|Crouch|2002|p=246}}</ref> The Norman nobility discussed declaring Theobald of Blois king.<ref>{{harvnb|King|2010|pp=47–48}}</ref> Theobald's younger brother, Stephen of Blois, quickly crossed from Boulogne to England, however, accompanied by his military household.<ref>{{harvnb|Barlow|1999|p=163}}; {{harvnb|King|2010|p=43}}</ref> With the help of his brother, [[Henry of Blois]], he seized power in England and was crowned king on 22 December.<ref>{{harvnb|King|2010|p=43}}</ref> The Empress Matilda did not give up her claim to England and Normandy, leading to the prolonged civil war known as [[the Anarchy]] between 1135 and 1153.<ref>{{harvnb|Carpenter|2004|pp=169–171}}</ref>

===Historiography===
[[File:Llyfr Coch Hergest 240-241.JPG|thumb|alt=Photograph of chronicle|Part of the Welsh ''[[Brut y Tywysogion|Brut]]'', one of the [[chronicler]] sources for Henry's reign]]
Historians have drawn on a range of sources on Henry, including the accounts of chroniclers; other documentary evidence, including early [[pipe roll]]s; and surviving buildings and architecture.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=1–2}}; {{harvnb|Newman|1988|p=7}}</ref> The three main chroniclers to describe the events of Henry's life were William of Malmesbury, Orderic Vitalis, and Henry of Huntingdon, but each incorporated extensive social and moral commentary into their accounts and borrowed a range of literary devices and stereotypical events from other popular works.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=2–5}}; {{harvnb|Newman|1988|p=7}}</ref> Other chroniclers include [[Eadmer]], [[Hugh the Chanter]], [[Abbot Suger]], and the authors of the Welsh ''[[Brut y Tywysogion|Brut]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=6–7}}</ref> Not all royal documents from the period have survived, but there are a number of royal acts, charters, writs, and letters, along with some early financial records.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=9}}</ref> Some of these have since been discovered to be forgeries, and others had been subsequently amended or tampered with.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=11}}</ref>

Late medieval historians seized on the accounts of selected chroniclers regarding Henry's education and gave him the title of Henry "Beauclerc", a theme echoed in the analysis of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] historians such as [[Francis Palgrave]] and [[Henry William Carless Davis|Henry Davis]].<ref>{{harvnb|David|1929|pp=45–46}}</ref> The historian Charles David dismissed this argument in 1929, showing the more extreme claims for Henry's education to be without foundation.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=33}}; {{harvnb|David|1929|p=56}}</ref> Modern histories of Henry commenced with [[R. W. Southern|Richard Southern]]'s work in the early 1960s, followed by extensive research during the rest of the 20th century into a wide number of themes from his reign in England, and a much more limited number of studies of his rule in Normandy.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=14–17}}</ref> Only two major, modern biographies of Henry have been produced, Warren Hollister's posthumous volume in 2001, and Judith Green's 2006 work.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=14–15}}; {{cite web | url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/archives/ | title=Off the Rocks  | accessdate=22 February 2013 | last=David| first=Carpenter | date= 7 July 2006 |mode=cs2 |publisher=Times Literary Supplement}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

Interpretation of Henry's personality by historians has altered over time. Earlier historians such as [[Austin Lane Poole|Austin Poole]] and Richard Southern considered Henry as a cruel, draconian ruler.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=314}}; {{harvnb|Southern|1962|p=231}}, cited in {{harvnb|Green|2009|p=314}}; {{harvnb|Poole|1993|p=99}}</ref> More recent historians, such as Hollister and Green, view his implementation of justice much more sympathetically, particularly when set against the standards of the day, but even Green has noted that Henry was "in many respects highly unpleasant", and Alan Cooper has observed that many contemporary chroniclers were probably too scared of the King to voice much criticism.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|p=314}}; {{harvnb|Green|1989|p=1}}; {{harvnb|Cooper|2001|p=65}}; {{harvnb|Hollister|2003|pp=484–485}}</ref> Historians have also debated the extent to which Henry's administrative reforms genuinely constituted an introduction of what Hollister and John Baldwin have termed systematic, "administrative kingship", or whether his outlook remained fundamentally traditional.<ref>{{harvnb|Green|2009|pp=15, 319}}; {{harvnb|Hollister|Baldwin|1978|pp=867–868}}</ref>

Henry's burial at Reading Abbey is marked by a local cross, but Reading Abbey was slowly demolished during the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century.<ref name=Duffy2003P52/> The exact location is uncertain, but the most likely location of the tomb itself is now in a built-up area of central Reading, on the site of the former abbey choir.<ref name=Duffy2003P52>{{harvnb|Duffy|2003|p=52}}</ref> A plan to locate his remains was announced in March 2015, with support from [[English Heritage]] and [[Philippa Langley]], who aided with the successful [[Exhumation of Richard III of England|exhumation of Richard III]].<ref>{{cite news|title=A Search for Bones of Henry I is Planned in Reading|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-32037999|work=BBC News|mode=cs2 |date=24 March 2015|accessdate=26 March 2015}}</ref>
