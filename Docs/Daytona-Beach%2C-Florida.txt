'''Daytona Beach''' is a city in [[Volusia County, Florida]], United States. It lies about {{convert|51|mi|km|1}} northeast of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], {{convert|86|mi|km|1}} southeast of [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and {{convert|242|mi|km|1}} northwest of [[Miami]]. In the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. Census]], it had a population of 61,005. It is a principal city of the [[Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, FL metropolitan statistical area]], which was home to 590,289 people in 2010. Daytona Beach is also a principal city of the [[Fun Coast]] region of Florida.

The city is historically known for its beach where the hard-packed sand allows motorized vehicles to drive on the beach in restricted areas.<ref>[http://www.professionaltravelguide.com/Destinations/Daytona-Beach-FL Daytona Beach Guide Overview]</ref> This hard-packed sand made Daytona Beach a mecca for [[motorsports]], and the old [[Daytona Beach Road Course]] hosted races for over 50 years. This was replaced in 1959 by [[Daytona International Speedway]]. The city is also the headquarters for [[NASCAR]].

Daytona Beach hosts large groups of out-of-towners that descend upon the city for various events, notably [[Speedweeks]] in early February when over 200,000 [[NASCAR]] fans come to attend the season-opening [[Daytona 500]]. Other events include the NASCAR [[Coke Zero 400]] race in July, [[Daytona Beach Bike Week|Bike Week]] in early March, [[Biketoberfest]] in late October, and the [[24 Hours of Daytona]] endurance race in January.

==History==
The area where Daytona Beach is today was once inhabited by the indigenous [[Timucuan]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]] who lived in fortified villages. The Timucuas were nearly exterminated by contact with Europeans through war, enslavement and disease and became extinct as a racial entity through assimilation and attrition during the 18th century. The [[Seminole]] Indians, descendants of [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]] Indians from Georgia and Alabama, frequented the area prior to the [[Second Seminole War]].

During the era of British rule of Florida between 1763 and 1783, the King's Road passed through present-day Daytona Beach. The road extended from St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, to Andrew Turnbull's experimental colony in [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida|New Smyrna]]. In 1804 Samuel Williams received a land grant of {{convert|3000|acre|km2}} from the [[Spanish Crown]], which had regained Florida from the British after the American Revolution. This land grant encompassed the area that would become Daytona Beach. Williams built a slave-labor-based plantation to grow cotton, rice and sugar cane. His son Samuel Hill Williams would abandon the plantation during the Second Seminole War, when the Seminoles burned it to the ground.

In 1871, Mathias Day, Jr. of Mansfield, Ohio, purchased a 2,144.5 acre tract of the former Williams Plantation, on the west bank of the tidal channel known as the [[Halifax River]]. He built a hotel around which the initial section of town, today the Daytona Beach Historic District, arose. In 1872, due to financial troubles, Day lost title to his land; nonetheless, residents decide to name the city Daytona in his honor, and incorporated the town in 1876.<ref>Historic Daytona Beach By Harold D. Cardwell, Priscilla D. Cardwell. p. 7 Publisher: Arcadia Publishing (August 25, 2004).
 ISBN 0-7385-1675-9</ref>

In 1886, the St. Johns & Halifax River Railway arrived in Daytona.  The line would be purchased in 1889 by [[Henry M. Flagler]], who made it part of his [[Florida East Coast Railway]].  The separate towns of Daytona, Daytona Beach, Kingston, and [[Seabreeze, Florida|Seabreeze]] merged as "Daytona Beach" in 1926, at the urging of civic leader J.B. Kahn and others.  By the 1920s, it was dubbed "The World's Most Famous Beach".

Daytona's wide beach of smooth, compacted sand attracted automobile and motorcycle races beginning in 1902, as pioneers in the industry tested their inventions.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://stars.library.ucf.edu/ahistoryofcentralfloridapodcast/28/|title = Episode 27 Leather Cap and Goggles|date = October 1, 2014|access-date = January 27, 2016|website = A History of Central Florida Podcast|publisher = |last = Dickens|first = Bethany}}</ref> It hosted [[land speed record]] attempts beginning in 1904, when [[William K. Vanderbilt]] set an unofficial record of {{convert|92.307|mph|abbr=on}}.<ref>Kettlewell, Mike. "Daytona", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'' (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.501.</ref> Land speed racers from [[Barney Oldfield]] to [[Henry Seagrave]] to [[Malcolm Campbell]] would visit Daytona repeatedly and make the {{convert|23|mi|km|abbr=on}} beach course famous.<ref>Kettlewell, pp.501–2; Northey, Tom, "Land-speed <!--This is in the original, don't change it--> record: The Fastest Men on Earth", in Northey, Tom, ed. ''World of Automobiles'', Volume 10, pp.1161–1165.</ref> Record attempts, including numerous fatal endeavors such as [[Frank Lockhart]] ([[Frank Lockhart#Land speed record|Stutz Black Hawk]], 1926) and [[Lee Bible]] ([[White Triplex|''Triplex Special'']], 1929), would continue until Campbell's March 7, 1935 effort, which set the record at {{convert|276.816|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and marked the end of Daytona's land speed racing days.<ref>Northey, p.1165.</ref>

On March 8, 1936, the first [[stock car]] race was held on the [[Daytona Beach Road Course]], located in the present-day Town of Ponce Inlet. In 1958, [[William France Sr.]] and [[NASCAR]] created the [[Daytona International Speedway]] to replace the beach course.  Automobiles are still permitted on most areas of the beach, at a maximum speed of {{convert|10|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.

Daytona Beach is located at 29°12′N 81°2′W (29.2073, −81.0379).  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|64.93|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. of which {{convert|58.68|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|6.25|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} is water. Water is 9.6% of the total area.

The city of Daytona Beach is split in two by the [[Halifax River]] lagoon, part of the [[Intracoastal Waterway]], and sits on the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered on the north by [[Holly Hill, Florida|Holly Hill]] and [[Ormond Beach, Florida|Ormond Beach]] and on the south by [[Daytona Beach Shores, Florida|Daytona Beach Shores]], [[South Daytona, Florida|South Daytona]] and [[Port Orange, Florida|Port Orange]].

=== Climate ===
Daytona Beach has a humid subtropical climate or Cfa – typical of the Gulf and South Atlantic states. As is typical of much of Florida, there are two seasons in Daytona Beach, the hot and wet season (late May through October) and the warm and dry season (November through April). 
 
In the hot season (summer) average daytime highs are in the 80s and low 90s (26 to 33&nbsp;°C) and average night-time lows are near 70&nbsp;°F (21&nbsp;°C) in Daytona Beach. The Bermuda High pumps hot and unstable tropical air from the Bahamas and Gulf of Mexico, resulting in daily, but brief thundershowers. A large amount of the yearly rainfall in Daytona Beach falls during this time of year.  Fall and spring are considered near perfect weather-wise, warm and sunny, with daily highs in the 75 to 80 F (21 to 24&nbsp;°C) range and overnight lows in the 50s to low 60s (10 to 17&nbsp;°C).

In the warm and dry season (winter), Daytona Beach has mostly mild and sunny weather typical of cities on the Florida peninsula. The coolest months are from December through February; average daytime highs range from 65 to 70&nbsp;°F (18 to 21&nbsp;°C) and nighttime lows are near 50 F (10&nbsp;°C). Occasional cold fronts often drop the daytime temperatures into the 50s F with nights in the 30s F a few times each month. Like much of Florida, Daytona Beach often can be very dry in late winter and early spring, and brush fires and water restrictions can be an issue. Daytona Beach averages only 6 frosts per year according to the National Weather Service office in Melbourne. There is no record of snow on the ground in Daytona Beach in the last 109{{when|date=September 2015}} years; however, snow flurries have been observed twice since 1880 – on January 1, 1977 and in January 2010.

===Hurricanes and tornadoes ===
[[File:Hurricane Charley 13 aug 2004 1635Z.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurricane Charley]], Crossed Florida and left land near Daytona Beach on August 13, 2004.<ref>Summary report on building performance: 2004 hurricane season By United States. Federal Emergency Management Agency p.6</ref>]]
Typically tropical cyclones pass offshore once they reach the northern portion of the Atlantic coast of Florida. As such, the hurricane risk for Daytona Beach is significantly lower than areas of southern Florida like Miami and Key West. The 2004 hurricane season was by far the most active in the Daytona Beach area in the last 50 years. However, since 1950 there has only been one direct hit by a tropical cyclone to the Daytona Beach area, Hurricane Donna in 1960.

Although Daytona Beach has a significantly lesser tornado risk than areas like the Great Plains and Midwest, there have been a few deadly and destructive tornadoes in the last 100 years in Daytona Beach area. Most recently, on February 22, 1998 a tornado killed 3 people, injured 70 people, and caused $31 million in damages.

===Rogue wave===
On July 3, 1992, a {{convert|28|mi|km|adj=on}} long [[rogue wave]] hit the Volusia County beaches. The wave's range was from Ormond Beach in the north, to New Smyrna Beach on the south. The crest was {{convert|9|ft|m}} high and centered at Daytona Beach. Sailboats crashed ashore onto cars and many people suffered cuts and bruises from glass and debris. Two people required hospitalization and 200 vehicles were damaged. 75 injuries were reported. The prevailing theory is that an underwater landslide caused the rogue wave, although others have theorized that it was the result of a squall line.<ref>[http://www.srh.noaa.gov/mlb/whirl/vol.html NOAA, Florida Weather History: Volusia County]</ref><ref>[http://ams.allenpress.com/archive/1520-0477/76/1/pdf/i1520-0477-76-1-21.pdf The Daytona Beach Wave of July 3–4, 1992: ''A Shallow Water Gravity Wave Forced by a Propagating Squall Line'', January 1995]</ref>

==Law and government==

===Local government===
Under Daytona Beach's commission-manager form of government, voters elect a [[City commission]] which consists of seven members who serve four-year, staggered terms. Six are elected by district, the Mayor is elected city-wide.

The City Commission establishes ordinances and policies for the city. It also reviews and approves the city budget annually. The Commission appoints a [[City Manager]], who carries out the will of the Commission and handles day-to-day business.

====Law enforcement====
{{main|Daytona Beach Police Department}}
Law enforcement in Daytona Beach is provided by the 241-member [[Daytona Beach Police Department]] (DBPD) headed by police chief Mike Chitwood. In a unique and controversial program to help fund the [[Police Explorer]] program, run by a subsidiary of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], T-shirts with the words ''Scumbag Eradication Team'': ''Not in Our Town'' are sold at the police headquarters.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Scumbag T-Shirt Raises Money For Police Youth Program|url = http://www.wftv.com/news/16071001/detail.html|website = www.wftv.com|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}</ref>

The T-shirts contain a caricature of Chief Chitwood standing next to a toilet bowl with the legs of multiple individuals sticking out. The T-shirt has been cited in at least one lawsuit against the DBPD alleging [[police brutality]], the lawyer in the case in which the client sustained broken ribs and a fractured eye socket during an arrest for an open container of beer, claims the T-shirt shows the DBPD condones violence.<ref>{{Cite web|title = FloriDUH {{!}} Sun Sentinel Blogs {{!}} Suit against top cop cites "Scumbag" T-shirt|url = http://weblogs.sun-sentinel.com/news/specials/weirdflorida/blog/2010/03/suit_against_a_sheriff_cites_s_1.html|website = weblogs.sun-sentinel.com|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}</ref>

The Volusia County Sheriff's department, headed by Ben E. Johnson is a countywide law enforcement agency with 446 sworn positions, 438 civilian employees, 300 volunteers and an annual operating budget of $73 million that has jurisdiction in unincorporated areas of Volusia County and provides additional law enforcement support to Daytona Beach during such events as the Daytona 500 and aids in joint investigations of certain crimes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = VOLUSIA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE|url = http://www.volusia.org/sheriff/|website = www.volusia.org|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}</ref>

The Volusia County Beach Patrol provides law enforcement as well as [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]] services along Volusia County beaches including the beaches in the city of Daytona Beach.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Beach Safety|url = http://www.volusia.org/beach/|website = www.volusia.org|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}</ref>

====Eminent domain case====
The city of Daytona Beach made national headlines when it designated the several mile radius around Main Street on the [[barrier island]] portion of the city as a blighted area and has targeted it for redevelopment by private developers. This follows the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision of the [[eminent domain]] case in ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'', which upheld the right of municipalities the right to use eminent domain to [[Takings Clause|take]] private property for redevelopment by private entities.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Daytona Business Owners Fight Eminent Domain|url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4760258|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}</ref>

===Federal, state, and county representation===
The [[United States Postal Service]] operates a post office at 500 Bill France Boulevard in Daytona Beach

Daytona Beach is part of [[Florida's 6th congressional district]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Find Your Representative in the U.S. House of Representatives.|url = http://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep?ZIP=32114&Submit=FIND+YOUR+REP+BY+ZIP|website = www.house.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}</ref> It is part of Florida's 25th and 26th State House of Representatives Districts and the 6th and 8th State Senate Districts.

Florida's 6th congressional district, which extends from the southern Jacksonville suburbs to [[New Smyrna Beach]] and includes [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] and Daytona Beach, is currently represented by Republican [[Ron DeSantis]].

===Airports===
[[File:Aerial view of runway 7R, Daytona Beach International Airport, 2007-11-03.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Daytona Beach International Airport.]]
Passenger airline services are located at [[Daytona Beach International Airport]] (DAB), which is centrally located within the city adjacent to [[Daytona International Speedway]].  The site was first used as an airport with terminals being constructed in 1952 and 1958.  The present facility was constructed in 1992 at the cost of $46 million, and includes both a domestic terminal and an International terminal. Despite the new facilities, DAB has found difficulty in attracting and retaining carriers; [[Continental Airlines]], [[AirTran Airways]], and [[United Airlines]] discontinued flights to Daytona in 2007 and 2008.<ref name="WebsiteHistory">{{cite web|url=http://flydaytonafirst.com/history.htm|title=DBIA History|publisher=Volusia County, Florida|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> LTU & American Airlines also serviced Daytona Beach during the 1980s and 1990s, both of which ended all flights in 1994 & 1997.

Current passenger airlines serving DAB include [[Delta Air Lines]] (with nonstop service to [[Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]]) and [[US Airways]] (with non-stop service to [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport|Charlotte]]). Both carriers offer connecting service from those cities to destinations worldwide. International flights from DAB fly to destinations in [[the Bahamas]] through [[air taxi]] and charter services [http://www.FlyAirGate.com Airgate Aviation] and IslandPass; non-stop flights are available from DAB to [[Marsh Harbour Airport|Marsh Harbour]], [[Treasure Cay Airport|Treasure Cay]], and [[North Eleuthera Airport|North Eleuthera]].<ref name="international">{{cite web|url=http://www.flyislandpass.com/|title=IslandPass|publisher=IslandPass, LLC|accessdate=2009-06-16}}</ref> DAB is also heavily used for [[general aviation]], largely due to [[Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University]], whose campus is located at the airport.

Larger airports nearby are [[Orlando International Airport]] and [[Jacksonville International Airport]], both of which are approximately one and one half hours away.
