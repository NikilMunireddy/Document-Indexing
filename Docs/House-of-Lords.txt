The '''House of Lords''', formally styled '''The Right Honourable The Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled''' and referred to ceremonially as the '''House of Peers''', is the [[upper house]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]].

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2009}}
Today's Parliament of the United Kingdom largely descends, in practice, from the [[Parliament of England]], though the [[Treaty of Union]] of 1706 and the [[Acts of Union, 1707|Acts of Union]] that ratified the Treaty in 1707 created a new [[Parliament of Great Britain]] to replace the Parliament of England and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. This new parliament was, in effect, the continuation of the Parliament of England with the addition of 45 [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] and 16 Peers to represent Scotland.

The Parliament of England developed from the ''[[Magnum Concilium]]'', the "Great Council" that advised the King during medieval times.<ref name=loveland1>[[#Loveland|Loveland]] (2009) p. 158</ref> This royal council came to be composed of ecclesiastics, noblemen, and representatives of the [[Historic counties of England|counties of England]] (afterwards, representatives of the [[Parliamentary borough|boroughs]] as well). The first English Parliament is often considered to be the "[[Model Parliament]]" (held in 1295), which included archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, barons, and representatives of the shires and boroughs of it.

The power of Parliament grew slowly, fluctuating as the strength of the monarchy grew or declined. For example, during much of the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] (1307–1327), the [[nobility]] was supreme, the [[The Crown|Crown]] weak, and the shire and borough representatives entirely powerless. In 1569, the authority of Parliament was for the first time recognised not simply by custom or royal charter, but by an authoritative statute, passed by Parliament itself.

Further developments occurred during the reign of Edward II's successor, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. It was during this King's reign that Parliament clearly separated into two distinct [[debating chamber|chambers]]: the House of Commons (consisting of the shire and borough representatives) and the House of Lords (consisting of the bishops and abbots and the [[peerage of England|peers]]). The authority of Parliament continued to grow, and, during the early fifteenth century, both Houses exercised powers to an extent not seen before. The Lords were far more powerful than the Commons because of the great influence of the great landowners and the prelates of the realm.

The power of the nobility suffered a decline during the civil wars of the late fifteenth century, known as the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Much of the nobility was killed on the battlefield or executed for participation in the war, and many aristocratic estates were lost to the Crown. Moreover, [[feudalism]] was dying, and the [[feudal]] armies controlled by the [[barons]] became obsolete. Henry VII (1485–1509) clearly established the supremacy of the monarch, symbolised by the "Crown Imperial". The domination of the Sovereign continued to grow during the reigns of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor monarchs]] in the 16th century. The Crown was at the height of its power during the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] (1509–1547).

The House of Lords remained more powerful than the House of Commons, but the Lower House continued to grow in influence, reaching a zenith in relation to the House of Lords during the middle 17th century. Conflicts between the King and the Parliament (for the most part, the House of Commons) ultimately led to the [[English Civil War]] during the 1640s. In 1649, after the defeat and execution of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]], the [[Commonwealth of England]] was declared, but the nation was effectively under the overall control of [[Oliver Cromwell]], Lord Protector of England.<ref name=abolishact>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.org/eng/conpur089.htm|title=An Act abolishing the House of Lords|accessdate=24 May 2008|date=19 March 1649}}</ref>

The House of Lords was reduced to a largely powerless body, with Cromwell and his supporters in the Commons dominating the Government. On 19 March 1649, the House of Lords was abolished by an Act of Parliament, which declared that "The Commons of England [find] by too long experience that the House of Lords is useless and dangerous to the people of England."<ref name=abolishact/> The House of Lords did not assemble again until the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]] met in 1660 and the monarchy was restored. It returned to its former position as the more powerful chamber of Parliament—a position it would occupy until the 19th century.

===19th century===
The 19th century was marked by several changes to the House of Lords. The House, once a body of only about 50&nbsp;members, had been greatly enlarged by the liberality of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George&nbsp;III]] and his successors in creating peerages. The individual influence of a Lord of Parliament was thus diminished.

Moreover, the power of the House as a whole experienced a decrease, whilst that of the House of Commons grew. Particularly notable in the development of the Lower House's superiority was the [[Reform Act 1832|Reform Bill of 1832]]. The electoral system of the House of Commons was not, at the time, democratic: property qualifications greatly restricted the size of the electorate, and the boundaries of many constituencies had not been changed for centuries.

Entire cities such as [[Manchester]] were not represented by a single individual in the House of Commons, but the 11 voters of [[Old Sarum (UK Parliament constituency)|Old Sarum]] retained their ancient right to elect two members of parliament. A small borough was susceptible to bribery, and was often under the control of a patron, whose nominee was guaranteed to win an election. Some aristocrats were patrons of numerous "[[rotten borough|pocket boroughs]]", and therefore controlled a considerable part of the membership of the House of Commons.

When the House of Commons passed a Reform Bill to correct some of these anomalies in 1831, the House of Lords rejected the proposal. The popular cause of reform, however, was not abandoned by the ministry, despite a second rejection of the bill in 1832. Prime Minister [[Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey|Earl Grey]] advised the King to overwhelm opposition to the bill in the House of Lords by creating about 80&nbsp;new pro-Reform peers. [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] originally balked at the proposal, which effectively threatened the opposition of the House of Lords, but at length relented.

Before the new peers were created, however, the Lords who opposed the bill admitted defeat, and abstained from the vote, allowing the passage of the bill. The crisis damaged the political influence of the House of Lords, but did not altogether end it. A vital reform was effected by the House itself in 1868, when it changed its standing orders so as to prevent noble Lords from voting without taking the trouble to attend.  Proxies were then abolished.<ref>McKechnie, ''The reform of the House of Lords'' etc</ref> Over the course of the century the power of the Upper House experienced further erosion,{{how|date=July 2013}}{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} and the Commons gradually became the stronger House of Parliament.

===20th century===
The status of the House of Lords returned to the forefront of debate after the election of a Liberal Government in 1906. In 1909, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[David Lloyd George]], introduced into the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] the "[[People's Budget]]", which proposed a land tax targeting wealthy landowners. The popular measure, however, was defeated in the heavily Conservative House of Lords.

Having made the powers of the House of Lords a primary campaign issue, the Liberals were narrowly re-elected in [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January 1910]]. Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] then proposed that the powers of the House of Lords be severely curtailed. After a further general election in [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]], and with an undertaking by King [[George V]] to create sufficient new Liberal peers to overcome Lords' opposition to the measure if necessary, the Asquith Government secured the passage of a bill to curtail the powers of the House of Lords.

The [[Parliament Act 1911]] effectively abolished the power of the House of Lords to reject legislation, or to amend in a way unacceptable to the House of Commons: most bills could be delayed for no more than three parliamentary sessions or two calendar years. It was not meant to be a permanent solution; more comprehensive reforms were planned. Neither party, however, pursued the matter with much enthusiasm, and the House of Lords remained primarily hereditary. In 1949, the Parliament Act reduced the delaying power of the House of Lords further to two sessions or one year.

In 1958, the predominantly hereditary nature of the House of Lords was changed by the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]], which authorised the creation of life baronies, with no numerical limits. The number of Life Peers then gradually increased, though not at a constant rate.

The Labour Party had for most of the twentieth century a commitment, based on the party's historic opposition to class privilege, to abolish the House of Lords, or at least expel the hereditary element. In 1968, the Labour Government of [[Harold Wilson]] attempted to reform the House of Lords by introducing a system under which hereditary peers would be allowed to remain in the House and take part in debate, but would be unable to vote. This plan, however, was defeated in the House of Commons by a coalition of traditionalist Conservatives (such as [[Enoch Powell]]), and Labour members who continued to advocate the outright abolition of the Upper House (such as [[Michael Foot]]).

When Michael Foot attained the leadership of the Labour Party in 1980, abolition of the House of Lords became a part of the party's agenda; under his successor, [[Neil Kinnock]], however, a reformed Upper House was proposed instead. In the meantime, the creation of hereditary peerages (except for members of the Royal Family) has been arrested, with the exception of three creations during the administration of the Conservative [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1980s.

Whilst some hereditary peers were at best apathetic the Labour Party's clear commitments were not lost on [[Merlin Hanbury-Tracy, 7th Baron Sudeley|Baron Sudeley]], who for decades was considered an expert on the House of Lords. In December 1979 the [[Conservative Monday Club]] published his extensive paper entitled ''Lords Reform – Why tamper with the House of Lords?'' and in July 1980 [[International Monarchist League|''The Monarchist'']] carried another article by Lord Sudeley entitled ''Why Reform or Abolish the House of Lords?''.<ref>''The Monarchist'', no. 57, p.&nbsp;27 – 34</ref> In 1990 he wrote a further booklet for the Monday Club entitled ''The Preservation of the House of Lords''.

===Lords reform===
{{Main|Reform of the House of Lords}}

====1997–2010====
The Labour Party included in its 1997 general election [[Manifesto]] a commitment to remove the hereditary peerage from the House of Lords.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Labour's 1997 pledges: The constitution | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 6 May 2002 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2002/blair_years/1959867.stm }}</ref> Their subsequent election victory in 1997 under [[Tony Blair]] finally heralded the demise of the traditional House of Lords. The Labour Government introduced legislation to expel all hereditary peers from the Upper House as a first step in Lords reform. As a part of a compromise, however, it agreed to permit 92 hereditary peers to remain until the reforms were complete. Thus all but 92 hereditary peers were expelled under the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] (see below for its provisions), making the House of Lords predominantly an appointed house.

Since 1999 however, no further reform has taken place. The [[Wakeham Commission]] proposed introducing a 20% elected element to the Lords, but this plan was widely criticised.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Lords report fails to satisfy | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 20 January 2000 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/611889.stm }}</ref> A [[Joint Committee]] was established in 2001 to resolve the issue, but it reached no conclusion and instead gave Parliament seven options to choose from (fully appointed, 20% elected, 40% elected, 50% elected, 60% elected, 80%, and fully elected). In a confusing series of votes in February 2003, all of these options were defeated although the 80% elected option fell by just three votes in the Commons. Socialist MPs favouring outright abolition voted against all the options.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In 2005 a cross-party group of senior MPs ([[Kenneth Clarke]], [[Paul Tyler]], [[Tony Wright (Staffordshire politician)|Tony Wright]], [[Sir George Young, 6th Baronet|Sir George Young]] and [[Robin Cook]]) published a report proposing that 70% of [[members of the House of Lords]] should be elected – each member for a single long term – by the [[single transferable vote]] system. Most of the remainder were to be appointed by a Commission to ensure a mix of "skills, knowledge and experience". This proposal was also not implemented. A cross-party campaign initiative called "[[Elect the Lords]]" was set up to make the case for a predominantly elected Second Chamber in the run up to the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]].

At the 2005 election, the Labour Party proposed further reform of the Lords, but without specific details.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Election issues: Constitutional Reform | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 5 April 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/issues/4372135.stm }}</ref> The Conservative Party, which had, prior to 1997, opposed any tampering with the House of Lords{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}, favoured an 80% elected Second Chamber, while the Liberal Democrats called for a fully elected [[Senate]]. During 2006, a cross-party committee discussed Lords reform, with the aim of reaching a consensus: its [[Reform of the House of Lords#2007 white paper|findings]] were published in early 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7027/7027.pdf |title=The House of Lords: Reform Cm 7027 |format=PDF |accessdate=9 April 2010}}</ref>

On 7 March 2007, members of the House of Commons voted ten times on a variety of alternative compositions for the upper chamber.<ref>{{Cite news | title = MPs back all-elected Lords plan | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 7 March 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6420965.stm }}</ref> Outright abolition, a wholly appointed house, a 20% elected house, a 40% elected house, a 50% elected house and a 60% elected house were all defeated in turn. Finally the vote for an 80% elected chamber was won by 305 votes to 267, and the vote for a wholly elected chamber was won by an even greater margin: 337 to 224. Significantly this last vote represented an overall majority of MPs.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Assinder | first = Nick | title = Where now for Lords reform? | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 14 March 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6449747.stm }}</ref>

Furthermore, examination of the names of MPs voting at each division shows that, of the 305 who voted for the 80% elected option, 211 went on to vote for the 100% elected option. Given that this vote took place after the vote on 80% – whose result was already known when the vote on 100% took place – this showed a clear preference for a fully elected upper house among those who voted for the only other option that passed. But this was nevertheless only an indicative vote and many political and legislative hurdles remained to be overcome for supporters of an elected second chamber. The House of Lords, soon after, rejected this proposal and voted for an entirely appointed House of Lords.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Peers reject Lords reform plans | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 14 March 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6446887.stm }}</ref>

In July 2008 [[Jack Straw]], the [[Secretary of State for Justice]] and [[Lord Chancellor]], introduced a [[white paper]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] proposing to replace the House of Lords with an 80–100% elected chamber, with one third being elected at each general election, for a term of approximately 12–15 years.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Straw unveils elected Lords plan | work = BBC | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = 14 July 2008 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7504820.stm }}</ref> The [[white paper]] states that as the peerage would be totally separated from membership of the upper house, the name "House of Lords" would no longer be appropriate: It goes on to explain that there is cross-party consensus for the new chamber to be titled the "Senate of the United Kingdom", however to ensure the debate remains on the role of the upper house rather than its title, the white paper is neutral on the title of the new house.

On 30 November 2009, a ''Code of Conduct for Members of the House of Lords'' was agreed by them; certain amendments were agreed by them on 30 March 2010 and on 12 June 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/WIS-news/Code-of-Conduct-for-Members-of-the-House-of-Lords.pdf parliament.uk: |title=Code of Conduct for Members of the House of Lords |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |edition=4th |date=May 2015 |page=2}}</ref> The [[United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal|scandal over expenses]] in the Commons was at its highest pitch only six months before, and the Labourite leadership under [[Janet Royall, Baroness Royall of Blaisdon|Janet Royall]] determined that something sympathetic should be done.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In Meg Russell’s article; "Is the House of Lords already reformed?" she states three essential features of a legitimate House of Lords.<ref name="russell" /> The first is that it must have adequate powers over legislation to make the government think twice before making a decision. The House of Lords, she argues, currently has enough power to make it relevant. During Tony Blair’s first year he was defeated thirty-eight times in the Lords.<ref name=treadwell>Treadwell (2010) p.2</ref> Secondly, as to the composition of the Lords, Meg Russell suggests that the composition must be distinct from the Commons, otherwise it would render the Lords useless. The third feature is the perceived legitimacy of the Lords. She writes; "In general legitimacy comes with election."<ref name=russell>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/1467-923X.00540 | issn = 0032-3179 | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 311‒318 | last = Russell | first = Meg | title = Is the House of Lords Already Reformed? | journal = The Political Quarterly | accessdate = 23 March 2013 | date = July 2003 | url = http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/1467-923X.00540 }}</ref><ref name=treadwell/>

If the Lords have a distinct and elected composition, this would probably come about through fixed term proportional representation. If this happens then the perceived legitimacy of the Lords could arguably outweigh the legitimacy of the Commons. This would especially be the case if the House of Lords had been elected more recently than the House of Commons as it could be said to reflect the will of the people better than the Commons.<ref name=treadwell/>

In this scenario there may well come a time when the Lords twice reject a Bill from the Commons and it is forced through. This would in turn trigger questions about the amount of power the Lords should have and there would be pressure for it to increase. This hypothetical process is known as the "circumnavigation of power theory".<ref name=treadwell/> It implies that it would never be in any government's interest to legitimise the Lords as they would be forfeiting their own power.

====2010–present====
The Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition agreed, following the 2010 general election, to clearly outline a provision for a wholly or mainly elected second chamber, elected by a proportional representation system. These proposals sparked a debate on 29 June 2010. As an interim measure, appointment of new peers will reflect shares of the vote secured by the political parties in the last general election.

Detailed proposals for Lords reform including a draft House of Lords Reform Bill were published on 17 May 2011. These include a 300-member hybrid house, of which 80% are elected. A further 20% would be appointed, and reserve space would be included for some Church of England bishops. Under the proposals, members would also serve single non-renewable terms of 15&nbsp;years. Former MPs would be allowed to stand for election to the Upper House, but members of the Upper House would not be immediately allowed to become MPs.

The details of the proposal were:<ref>{{Cite report |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=May 2011 |title=House of Lords Reform Draft Bill |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/229020/8077.pdf |publisher=HM Government |pages=7-9 |docket= |accessdate=18 January 2016 |quote= }}</ref>
* The upper chamber shall continue to be known as the House of Lords for legislative purposes.
* The reformed House of Lords should have 300 members of which 240 are "Elected Members" and 60 appointed "Independent Members". Up to 12 Church of England bishops may sit in the house as ex-officio "Lords Spiritual".
* Elected Members will serve a single, non renewable term of 15&nbsp;years.
* Elections to the reformed Lords should take place at the same time as elections to the House of Commons.
* Elected Members should be elected using the Single Transferable Vote system of proportional representation.
* Twenty Independent Members (a third) shall take their seats within the reformed house at the same time as elected members do so and for the same 15-year term.
* Independent Members will be appointed by the Queen after being suggested by the Prime Minister acting on advice of an Appointments Commission.
* There will no longer be a link between the peerage system and membership of the upper house.
* The current powers of the House of Lords would not change and the House of Commons shall retain its status as the primary House of Parliament.

The proposals were considered by a Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform made up of both MPs and Peers, which issued its final report on 23 April 2012, making the following suggestions:{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
* The reformed House of Lords should have 450 members.
* Party groupings, including the Crossbenchers, should choose which of their members are retained in the transition period, with the percentage of members allotted to each group based on their share of the peers with high attendance during a given period.
* Up to 12 Lords Spiritual should be retained in a reformed House of Lords.

This act makes provision to preferentially admit bishops of the Church of England who are women to the Lords Spiritual in the 10 years following its commencement.

In 2015, [[Rachel Treweek]], [[Bishop of Gloucester]], became the first woman to sit as a [[Lord Spiritual]] in the House of Lords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2015/23-october/news/uk/rachel-treweek-becomes-first-woman-bishop-to-enter-house-of-lords |title=Rachel Treweek becomes first woman bishop to enter House of Lords |publisher=Churchtimes.co.uk |date=2015-10-26 |accessdate=2015-10-30}}</ref>

====Overcrowding====
The size of the House of Lords has varied greatly throughout its history. From about 50 members in the early 1700s,<ref>{{cite web |first=Darren |last=Hughes |publisher=Electoral Reform Society |title=The Supersized House of Lords |url=http://www.electoral-reform.org.uk/blog/the-supersized-house-of-lords |date=16 June 2013}}</ref> it increased to a record size of 1,330 in October 1999, before Lords reform reduced it to 669 by March 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldbrief/10402.htm |title=House of Lords – Annual Report and Accounts 1999–2000 |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=19 May 2008|quote=This major change had the effect of reducing the total membership of the House from 1,330 in October 1999 – the highest figure ever recorded – to 669 in March 2000}}</ref>

In April 2011, a cross-party group of former leading politicians, including many senior members of the House of Lords, called on the Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] to stop creating new peers. He had created 117 new peers since becoming prime minister in May 2010, a faster rate of elevation than any PM in British history. The expansion occurred while his government had tried (in vain) to reduce the size of the House of Commons by 50 members, from 650 to 600.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crick |first=Michael |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/legacy/newsnight/michaelcrick/2011/04/stop_making_new_lords_politica.html |title=Stop making new lords, political big-wigs urge Cameron |publisher=BBC News |date=19 April 2011 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>

She made her remarks days before a new batch of peers were due to be appointed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Savage |first=Michael |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article4166892.ece?CMP=OTH-gnws-standard-2014_08_04 |title=Betty Boothroyd urges older peers to retire |newspaper=The Times |date=4 August 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2014}}</ref>

In August 2015, following the creation of a further 45 peers in the [[Crown Honours Lists#Dissolution Honours|Dissolution Honours]], the total number of eligible members of the Lords increased to 826. In a report entitled ''Does size matter?'' the BBC said: "Increasingly, yes. Critics argue the House of Lords is the second largest legislature after the Chinese National People's Congress and dwarfs Upper Houses in other bi-cameral democracies such as the United States (100 senators), France (348 senators), Australia (76 senators) and India (250 members). The Lords is also larger than the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea (687 members). [… ] Peers grumble that there is not enough room to accommodate all of their colleagues in the Chamber, where there are only about 400 seats, and say they are constantly jostling for space – particularly during high-profile sittings", but added, "On the other hand, defenders of the Lords say that it does a vital job scrutinising legislation, a lot of which has come its way from the Commons in recent years".<ref name="BBC News 28 August 2015">{{cite web | title= House of Lords: Does size matter? |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33701011| author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date= 28 August 2015 | website= [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate= 28 August 2015}}</ref>

===Relationship with the Government===
The House of Lords does not control the term of the Prime Minister or of the Government.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Parliament and government | work = Parliament of the United Kingdom | accessdate = 25 March 2013 | date = 21 April 2010 | url = http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/role/parliament-government/ }}</ref> Only the Lower House may force the Prime Minister to resign or call elections by passing a motion of no-confidence or by [[Loss of supply|withdrawing supply]]. Thus, the House of Lords' oversight of the government is limited.

Most Cabinet ministers are from the House of Commons rather than the House of Lords. In particular, all Prime Ministers since 1902 have been members of the Lower House.<ref name=wasson>{{Cite book | publisher = John Wiley & Sons | isbn = 9781405139359 | last = Wasson | first = Ellis | title = A History of Modern Britain: 1714 to the Present | date = 31 August 2009 }}</ref> ([[Alec Douglas-Home]], who became Prime Minister in 1963 whilst still an Earl, disclaimed his peerage and was elected to the Commons soon after his term began.) In recent history, it has been very rare for major cabinet positions (except [[Lord Chancellor]] and [[Leader of the House of Lords]]) to have been filled by peers.

Exceptions include [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], who was the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] between 1979 and 1982, [[Lord Young of Graffham]] ([[Minister without Portfolio]], then [[Secretary of State for Employment]] and then [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]] from 1984 to 1989), [[Valerie Amos|Lady Amos]], who served as [[Secretary of State for International Development]] and [[Peter Mandelson|Lord Mandelson]], who served as [[First Secretary of State]], [[Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and [[President of the Board of Trade]]. [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George Robertson]] was briefly a peer whilst serving as [[Secretary of State for Defence]] before resigning to take up the post of [[Secretary General of NATO]]. From 1999 to 2010 the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] was a Member of the House of Lords; the most recent was [[Baroness Scotland of Asthal]].

The House of Lords remains a source for junior ministers and members of government. Like the House of Commons, the Lords also has a [[Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms|Government Chief Whip]] as well as several Junior Whips. Where a government department is not represented by a minister in the Lords or one is not available, government whips will act as spokesmen for them.<ref name=companion>{{Cite book | edition = 23 | publisher = The Stationery Office | author = House of Lords | title = Companion to the standing orders and guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords | location = London | year = 2013 | url = http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2013/2013comp.pdf | accessdate = 25 March 2013 }}</ref>

===Legislative functions===
{{Further|Act of Parliament}}
[[Image:Palace of Westminster, London - Feb 2007.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The House of Lords meets in a chamber in the Palace of Westminster.]]
Legislation, with the exception of [[money bills]], may be introduced in either House.

The House of Lords debates legislation, and has power to amend or reject bills. However, the power of the Lords to reject a bill passed by the House of Commons is severely restricted by the Parliament Acts. Under those Acts, certain types of bills may be presented for the [[Royal Assent]] without the consent of the House of Lords (i.e. the Commons can override the Lords' veto). The House of Lords cannot delay a money bill (a bill that, in the view of the Speaker of the House of Commons, solely concerns national taxation or public funds) for more than one month.

Other public bills cannot be delayed by the House of Lords for more than two parliamentary sessions, or one calendar year. These provisions, however, only apply to public bills that originate in the House of Commons, and cannot have the effect of extending a parliamentary term beyond five years. A further restriction is a [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] known as the [[Salisbury Convention]], which means that the House of Lords does not oppose legislation promised in the Government's election [[manifesto]].

By a custom that prevailed even before the Parliament Acts, the House of Lords is further restrained insofar as financial bills are concerned. The House of Lords may neither originate a bill concerning taxation or Supply (supply of treasury or exchequer funds), nor amend a bill so as to insert a taxation or Supply-related provision. (The House of Commons, however, often waives its privileges and allows the Upper House to make amendments with financial implications.) Moreover, the Upper House may not amend any Supply Bill. The House of Lords formerly maintained the absolute power to reject a bill relating to revenue or Supply, but this power was curtailed by the Parliament Acts, as aforementioned.

===Former judicial role===
{{Main|Judicial functions of the House of Lords}}
Historically, the House of Lords held several judicial functions. Most notably, until 2009 the House of Lords served as the [[court of last resort]] for most instances of UK law. Since 1 October 2009 this role is now held by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]].

The Lords' judicial functions originated from the ancient role of the [[Curia Regis]] as a body that addressed the petitions of the King's subjects. The functions were exercised not by the whole House, but by a committee of "Law Lords". The bulk of the House's judicial business was conducted by the twelve [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]], who were specifically appointed for this purpose under the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]].

The judicial functions could also be exercised by Lords of Appeal (other members of the House who happened to have held high judicial office). No Lord of Appeal in Ordinary or Lord of Appeal could sit judicially beyond the age of seventy-five. The judicial business of the Lords was supervised by the Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary and their deputy, the Second Senior Lord of Appeal in Ordinary.

The jurisdiction of the House of Lords extended, in civil and in criminal cases, to appeals from the courts of England and Wales, and of Northern Ireland. From Scotland, appeals were possible only in civil cases; Scotland's [[High Court of Justiciary]] is the highest court in criminal matters. The House of Lords was not the United Kingdom's only court of last resort; in some cases, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] performs such a function. The jurisdiction of the Privy Council in the United Kingdom, however, is relatively restricted; it encompasses appeals from [[ecclesiastical]] courts, disputes under the [[House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975]], and a few other minor matters. Issues related to [[devolution]] were transferred from the Privy Council to the Supreme Court in 2009.

The twelve Law Lords did not all hear every case; rather, after World War II cases were heard by panels known as Appellate Committees, each of which normally consisted of five members (selected by the Senior Lord). An Appellate Committee hearing an important case could consist of more than five members. Though Appellate Committees met in separate committee rooms, judgement was given in the Lords Chamber itself. No further appeal lay from the House of Lords, although the House of Lords could refer a "preliminary question" to the [[European Court of Justice]] in cases involving an element of [[European Union law]], and a case could be brought at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] if the House of Lords did not provide a satisfactory remedy in cases where the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was relevant.

A distinct judicial function—one in which the whole House used to participate—is that of trying [[impeachment]]s. Impeachments were brought by the House of Commons, and tried in the House of Lords; a conviction required only a majority of the Lords voting. Impeachments, however, are to all intents and purposes obsolete; the last impeachment was that of [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]] in 1806.

Similarly, the House of Lords was once the court that tried peers charged with high [[treason]] or [[felony]]. The House would be presided over not by the [[Lord Chancellor]], but by the [[Lord High Steward]], an official especially appointed for the occasion of the trial. If Parliament was not in session, then peers could be tried in a separate court, known as the Lord High Steward's Court. Only peers, their wives, and their widows (unless remarried) were entitled to [[List of trials of peers in the House of Lords|trials in the House of Lords or the Lord High Steward's Court]]; the Lords Spiritual were tried in Ecclesiastical Courts. In 1948, the right of peers to be tried in such special courts was abolished; now, they are tried in the regular courts. The last such trial in the House was of [[Edward Southwell Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford]] in 1935. An illustrative dramatisation circa 1928 of a trial of a peer (the fictional Duke of Denver) on a charge of murder (a felony) is portrayed in the 1972 BBC Television adaption of [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]' [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] mystery ''[[Clouds of Witness]]''.

The [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]] resulted in the creation of a separate [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]], to which the judicial function of the House of Lords, and some of the judicial functions of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, were transferred. In addition, the office of Lord Chancellor was reformed by the act, removing his ability to act as both a government minister and a judge. This was motivated in part by concerns about the historical admixture of legislative, judicial, and executive power. The new Supreme Court is located at [[Middlesex Guildhall]].

===Lords Spiritual===
{{Main|Lords Spiritual}}
Members of the House of Lords who sit by virtue of their ecclesiastical offices are known as Lords Spiritual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/lords-spiritual-and-temporal/|title=Lords Spiritual and Temporal|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> Formerly, the Lords Spiritual were the majority in the English House of Lords,<ref name=shell1>[[#Shell|Shell]] (2007) p.54</ref> comprising the church's [[archbishop]]s, [[bishop|(diocesan) bishops]], [[abbot]]s, and those [[prior]]s who were entitled to wear a [[mitre]]. After the [[English Reformation]]'s highpoint in 1539, only the archbishops and bishops continued to attend, as the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] had just disproved of and suppressed the positions of abbot and prior. In 1642 during the few Lords' gatherings convened during [[English Interregnum]] which saw periodic war, the Lords Spiritual were excluded altogether, but they returned under the [[Clergy Act 1661]].

The number of Lords Spiritual was further restricted by the [[Bishopric of Manchester Act 1847]], and by later acts. The Lords Spiritual can now number no more than 26; these are the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Archbishop of York]], the [[Bishop of London]], the [[Bishop of Durham]], the [[Bishop of Winchester]] (who sit by right regardless of seniority) and the 21 longest-serving bishops from other [[diocese]]s in the Church of England<ref>[[#Shell|Shell]] (2007) p.53</ref> (excluding the dioceses of [[Diocese of Sodor and Man|Sodor and Man]] and [[Diocese of Gibraltar in Europe|Gibraltar in Europe]], as these lie entirely outside the United Kingdom).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2001/en/ukpgaen_20010013_en_1|title=Explanatory Notes to The House of Commons (Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Act 2001|publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]]|location=London, United Kingdom|accessdate=5 September 2009|date=21 May 2001}}</ref> Following a change to the law in 2014 to allow women to be ordained bishops, the [[Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015]] was passed, which provides that whenever a vacancy arises among the Lords Spiritual during the ten years following the Act coming into force, the vacancy has to be filled by a woman, if one is eligible. This does not apply to the five bishops who sit by right.

The current Lords Spiritual represent only the Church of England. Bishops of the [[Church of Scotland]] traditionally sat in the [[Parliament of Scotland]] but were finally excluded in 1689 (after a number of previous exclusions) when the Church of Scotland became permanently presbyterian. There are no longer [[bishops in the Church of Scotland]] in the traditional sense of the word, and that Church has never sent members to sit in the Westminster House of Lords. The [[Church of Ireland]] did obtain representation in the House of Lords after the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801.

Of the Church of Ireland's ecclesiastics, four (one archbishop and three bishops) were to sit at any one time, with the members rotating at the end of every parliamentary session (which normally lasted approximately one year). The Church of Ireland, however, was [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|disestablished]] in 1871, and thereafter ceased to be represented by Lords Spiritual. Bishops of Welsh sees in the Church of England originally sat in the House of Lords (after 1847, only if their seniority within the Church entitled them to), but the [[Church in Wales]] ceased to be a part of the Church of England in 1920 and was simultaneously [[Disestablishment of the Church in Wales|disestablished]] in Wales.<ref>[[#Shell|Shell]] (2007) p.55</ref> Accordingly, bishops of the Church in Wales were no longer eligible to be appointed to the House as bishops of the Church of England.

Other ecclesiastics have sat in the House of Lords as Lords Temporal in recent times: [[Chief Rabbi]] [[Immanuel Jakobovits]] was appointed to the House of Lords (with the consent of the Queen, who acted on the advice of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]), as was his successor Chief Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chiefrabbi.org/ReadContent1849.aspx |title=Biography of the Chief Rabbi |publisher=Office of the Chief Rabbi |location=London, United Kingdom |accessdate=16 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20091001042614/http://www.chiefrabbi.org:80/ReadContent1849.aspx |archivedate=1 October 2009 }}</ref> In recognition of his work at reconciliation and in the [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace process]] in Northern Ireland, the [[Archbishop of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Archbishop of Armagh]] (the senior Anglican bishop in [[Northern Ireland]]), [[Lord Eames]] was appointed to the Lords by [[John Major]]. Other clergymen appointed include the Reverend [[Donald Soper]], the Reverend [[Timothy Beaumont]], and some Scottish clerics.

There have been no Roman Catholic clergymen appointed, though it was rumoured that [[Basil Hume|Cardinal Basil Hume]] and his successor [[Cormac Murphy O'Connor]] were offered peerages, by [[James Callaghan]], [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Tony Blair]] respectively, but declined.  Hume later accepted the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]], a personal appointment of the Queen, shortly before his death.  O'Connor said he had his maiden speech ready, but Roman Catholics who have received Holy Orders are prohibited by [[Canon Law]] from holding major offices connected with any government other than the [[Holy See]].  

Former Archbishops of Canterbury, having reverted to the status of bishop but who are no longer diocesans, are invariably given life peerages and sit as Lords Temporal.

By custom at least one of the Bishops reads prayers in each legislative day (a role taken by the chaplain in the Commons).<ref name=shell1/> They often speak in debates; in 2004 [[Rowan Williams]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], opened a debate into sentencing legislation.<ref name=shell1/> [[List of Church of England Measures|Measures]] ([[Bill (proposed law)|proposed laws]] of the Church of England) must be put before the Lords, and the Lords Spiritual have a role in ensuring that this takes place.<ref name=shell1/>

===Lords Temporal===
Since the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]], the Lords Temporal have been the most numerous group in the House of Lords. Unlike the Lords Spiritual, they may be publicly partisan, aligning themselves with one or another of the political parties that dominate the House of Commons. Publicly non-partisan Lords are called [[crossbencher]]s. Originally, the Lords Temporal included several hundred [[hereditary peer]]s (that is, those whose peerages may be inherited), who ranked variously as [[duke]]s, [[marquess]]es, [[earl]]s, [[viscount]]s, and [[baron]]s (as well as Scottish [[Lords of Parliament]]). Such hereditary dignities can be created by the Crown; in modern times this is done on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day (except in the case of members of the Royal Family).

Holders of [[peerage of Scotland|Scottish]] and [[peerage of Ireland|Irish]] peerages were not always permitted to sit in the Lords. When Scotland united with England to form [[Great Britain]] in 1707, it was provided that the Scottish hereditary peers would only be able to elect 16 [[representative peer]]s to sit in the House of Lords; the term of a representative was to extend until the next general election. A similar provision was enacted when Ireland merged with Great Britain in 1801 to form the [[United Kingdom]]; the Irish peers were allowed to elect 28 representatives, who were to retain office for life. Elections for Irish representatives ended in 1922, when most of Ireland became an independent state; elections for Scottish representatives ended with the passage of the [[Peerage Act 1963]], under which all Scottish peers obtained seats in the Upper House.

In 1999, the Labour government brought forward the [[House of Lords Act 1999|House of Lords Act]] removing the right of several hundred hereditary peers to sit in the House. The Act provided, as a measure intended to be temporary, that 92 people would continue to sit in the Lords by virtue of hereditary peerages, and this is still in effect.

Of the 92, two remain in the House of Lords because they hold royal offices connected with Parliament: the [[Earl Marshal#England|Earl Marshal]] and the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]]. Of the remaining ninety peers sitting in the Lords by virtue of a hereditary peerage, 14 are elected by the whole House and 74 are chosen by fellow hereditary peers in the House of Lords, grouped by party. (If a hereditary peerage holder is given a life peerage, he or she becomes a member of the House of Lords without a need for a by-election.) The exclusion of other hereditary peers removed the [[Prince of Wales]] (who is also [[Earl of Chester]]) and all other Royal Peers, including the [[Duke of Edinburgh]], [[Duke of York]], [[Earl of Wessex]], [[Duke of Gloucester]] and [[Duke of Kent]].

The number of peers to be chosen by a political group reflects the proportion of hereditary peers that belonged to that group (see [[#Current composition|current composition]] below) in 1999. When an elected hereditary peer dies, a by-election is held, with a variant of the [[Instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]] system being used. If the recently deceased hereditary peer had been elected by the whole House, then so is his or her replacement; a hereditary peer elected by a specific political group (including the non-aligned crossbenchers) is replaced by a vote of the hereditary peers already elected to the Lords belonging to that political group (whether elected by that group or by the whole house).

Until 2009, the Lords Temporal also included the [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary]], a group of individuals appointed to the House of Lords so that they could exercise its judicial functions. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, more commonly known as Law Lords, were first appointed under the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]]. They were selected by the Prime Minister of the day, but were formally appointed by the Sovereign. A Lord of Appeal in Ordinary had to retire at the age of 70, or, if his or her term was extended by the government, at the age of 75; after reaching such an age, the Law Lord could not hear any further cases in the House of Lords.

The number of Lords of Appeal in Ordinary (excluding those who were no longer able to hear cases because of age restrictions) was limited to twelve, but could be changed by [[statutory instrument]]. By a convention of the House, Lords of Appeal in Ordinary did not take part in debates on new legislation, so as to maintain judicial independence. Lords of Appeal in Ordinary held their seats in the House of Lords for life, remaining as members even after reaching the judicial retirement age of 70 or 75. Former Lord Chancellors and holders of other high judicial office could also sit as Law Lords under the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, although in practice this right was only rarely exercised.

Under the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary when the Act came into effect in 2009 became judges of the new [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] and were then barred from sitting or voting in the House of Lords until they had retired as judges. One of the main justifications for the new Supreme Court was to establish a separation of powers between the judiciary and the legislature. It is therefore unlikely that future appointees to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom will be made Lords of Appeal in Ordinary.

The largest group of Lords Temporal, and indeed of the whole House, are [[life peer]]s. Life peerages rank only as barons or baronesses, and are created under the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]]. Like all other peers, life peers are created by the Sovereign, who acts on the advice of the Prime Minister or the [[House of Lords Appointments Commission]]. By convention, however, the Prime Minister allows leaders of other parties to nominate some life peers, so as to maintain a political balance in the House of Lords. Moreover, some non-party life peers (the number being determined by the Prime Minister) are nominated by the independent House of Lords Appointments Commission.

In 2000, the government announced it would set up an Independent Appointments Commission, under [[Lord Stevenson of Coddenham]], to select fifteen so-called "[[people's peer]]s" for life peerages. However, when the choices were announced in April 2001, from a list of 3,000 applicants, the choices were treated with criticism in the media, as all were distinguished in their field, and none were "ordinary people" as some had originally hoped.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk_politics/2001/open_politics/lords/peoples_peers.stm People's Peers: the strange case of the missing lollipop ladies], BBC News Open Politics, 2001.</ref>

===Qualifications===
Several different qualifications apply for membership of the House of Lords. No person may sit in the House of Lords if under the age of 21.<ref name="standing_orders1">{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/ldstords.htm|title=The Standing Orders of the House of Lords relating to Public Business|accessdate=19 August 2010|date=8 April 2010|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> Furthermore, only citizens of the United Kingdom, [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] citizens, and citizens of Ireland may sit in the House of Lords. The nationality restrictions were previously more stringent: under the [[Act of Settlement 1701]], and prior to the [[British Nationality Act 1948]], only natural-born subjects were qualified.

Additionally, some bankruptcy-related restrictions apply to members of the Upper House. A person may not sit in the House of Lords if he or she is the subject of a Bankruptcy Restrictions Order (applicable in England and Wales only), or if he or she is adjudged bankrupt (in Northern Ireland), or if his or her estate is sequestered (in Scotland). A final restriction bars an individual convicted of [[high treason]] from sitting in the House of Lords until completing his or her full term of imprisonment. An exception applies, however, if the individual convicted of high treason receives a full pardon. Note that an individual serving a prison sentence for an offence other than high treason is ''not'' automatically disqualified.

Women were excluded from the House of Lords until the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]],<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1958| chapter = 21| act = Life Peerages Act 1958}}</ref> passed to address the declining number of active members, made possible the creation of peerages for life. Women were immediately eligible and four were among the first life peers appointed. However, hereditary peeresses continued to be excluded until the passage of the [[Peerage Act 1963]].<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1963| chapter = 48| act = Peerage Act 1963}}</ref> Since the passage of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]],<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1999| chapter = 34| act = House of Lords Act 1999}}</ref> hereditary peeresses remain eligible for election to the Upper House; there is one ([[Margaret of Mar, 31st Countess of Mar|Countess of Mar]]) among the 90 hereditary peers who continue to sit.

====Cash for Peerages====
The [[Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925]]<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 1925| chapter = 72| act = Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925}}</ref> made it illegal for a peerage, or other honour, to be bought or sold. Nonetheless, there have been repeated allegations that life peerages (and thus membership of the House of Lords) have been made available to major political donors in exchange for donations. The most prominent case, the 2006 [[Cash for Honours]] scandal, saw a police investigation, with no charges being brought.  A 2015 study found that of 303 people nominated for peerages in the period 2005–14, a total of 211 were former senior figures within politics (including former MPs), or were non-political appointments. Of the remaining 92 political appointments from outside public life, 27 had made significant donations to political parties. The authors concluded firstly that nominees from outside public life were much more likely to have made large gifts than peers nominated after prior political or public service. They also found that significant donors to parties were far more likely to be nominated for peerages than other party members.<ref>Mell, Radford and Thevoz, pp 8, 13,17, 22</ref>

===Removal from House membership===
Traditionally there was no mechanism by which members could resign or be removed from the House of Lords (compare the situation as regards [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation from the House of Commons]]). The [[Peerage Act 1963]] permitted a person to disclaim their newly inherited peerage (within certain time limits); this meant that such a person could effectively renounce their membership of the Lords. This might be done in order to remain or become qualified to sit in the House of Commons, as in the case of [[Tony Benn]] (formerly the second [[Viscount Stansgate]]), who had campaigned for such a change.
 
In 2014, the [[House of Lords Reform Act 2014]]<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 2014| chapter = 24| act = House of Lords Reform Act 2014}}</ref> made provision for members' resignation from the House, removal for non-attendance, and automatic expulsion upon conviction for a serious criminal offence (if resulting in a jail sentence of at least one year). In June 2015, under the [[House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015]],<ref>{{Cite legislation UK | type = act| year = 2015| chapter = 14| act = House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015}}</ref> the House's Standing Orders may provide for the expulsion or suspension of a member upon a resolution of the House.

==Officers==
Traditionally the House of Lords did not elect its own speaker, unlike the House of Commons; rather, the ''ex officio'' presiding officer was the [[Lord Chancellor]]. With the passage of the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]], the post of [[Lord Speaker]] was created, a position to which a peer is elected by the House and subsequently appointed by the [[The Crown|Crown]]. The first Lord Speaker, elected on 4 May 2006, was [[Helene Hayman, Baroness Hayman|Baroness Hayman]], a former Labour peer. As the Speaker is expected to be an impartial presiding officer, Baroness Hayman resigned from the Labour Party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/principal/interviews/lordspeaker.cfm |title=Interview with the Lord Speaker |publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom |accessdate=25 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090126184819/http://www.parliament.uk:80/about/how/principal/interviews/lordspeaker.cfm |archivedate=26 January 2009 }}</ref> In 2011, [[Baroness D'Souza]] was elected as the second Lord Speaker, replacing Baroness Hayman in September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14190737|title=Baroness D'Souza elected Lord Speaker|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref>

This reform of the post of Lord Chancellor was made due to the perceived constitutional anomalies inherent in the role. The Lord Chancellor was not only the Speaker of the House of Lords, but also a member of the Cabinet; his or her department, formerly the Lord Chancellor's Department, is now called the Ministry of Justice. The Lord Chancellor is no longer the head of the judiciary of England and Wales. Hitherto, the Lord Chancellor was part of all three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial.

The overlap of the legislative and executive roles is a characteristic of the [[Westminster system]], as the entire cabinet consists of members of the House of Commons or the House of Lords; however, in June 2003, the Blair Government announced its intention to abolish the post of Lord Chancellor because of the office's mixed executive and judicial responsibilities. The abolition of the office was rejected by the House of Lords, and the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 was thus amended to preserve the office of Lord Chancellor. The Act no longer guarantees that the office holder of Lord Chancellor is the presiding officer of the House of Lords, and therefore allows the House of Lords to elect a speaker of their own.

[[Image:Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham by Charles Robert Leslie.jpg|thumb|rightt|[[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham|Charles Pepys]] as Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor wore black and gold robes whilst presiding over the House of Lords.]]
The Lord Speaker may be replaced as presiding officer by one of his or her deputies. The [[Chairman of Committees (House of Lords)|Chairman of Committees]], the Principal Deputy Chairman of Committees, and several Chairmen are all deputies to the Lord Speaker, and are all appointed by the House of Lords itself at the beginning of each session. By custom, the Crown appoints each Chairman, Principal Deputy Chairman and Deputy Chairman to the additional office of Deputy Speaker of the House of Lords.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/deputy-speakers/|title=Deputy Speakers|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=2 July 2011}}</ref> There was previously no legal requirement that the Lord Chancellor or a Deputy Speaker be a member of the House of Lords (though the same has long been customary).

Whilst presiding over the House of Lords, the Lord Chancellor traditionally wore ceremonial black and gold robes. Robes of black and gold are now worn by the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice in the House of Commons, on ceremonial occasions. This is no longer a requirement for the Lord Speaker except for State occasions outside of the chamber. The Speaker or Deputy Speaker sits on the [[Woolsack]], a large red seat stuffed with wool, at the front of the Lords Chamber.

When the House of Lords resolves itself into committee (see below), the Chairman of Committees or a Deputy Chairman of Committees presides, not from the Woolsack, but from a chair at the Table of the House. The presiding officer has little power compared to the [[Speaker of the United Kingdom House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. He or she only acts as the mouthpiece of the House, performing duties such as announcing the results of votes. This is because, unlike in the House of Commons where all statements are directed to "Mr/Madam Speaker", in the House of Lords they are directed to "My Lords"; i.e., the entire body of the House.

The Lord Speaker or Deputy Speaker cannot determine which members may speak, or discipline members for violating the rules of the House; these measures may be taken only by the House itself. Unlike the politically neutral Speaker of the House of Commons, the Lord Chancellor and Deputy Speakers originally remained members of their respective parties, and were permitted to participate in debate; however, this is no longer true of the new role of Lord Speaker.

Another officer of the body is the [[Leader of the House of Lords]], a peer selected by the Prime Minister. The Leader of the House is responsible for steering Government bills through the House of Lords, and is a member of the Cabinet. The Leader also advises the House on proper procedure when necessary, but such advice is merely informal, rather than official and binding. A Deputy Leader is also appointed by the Prime Minister, and takes the place of an absent or unavailable leader.

The [[Clerk of the Parliaments]] is the chief clerk and officer of the House of Lords (but is not a member of the House itself). The Clerk, who is appointed by the Crown, advises the presiding officer on the rules of the House, signs orders and official communications, endorses bills, and is the keeper of the official records of both Houses of Parliament. Moreover, the Clerk of the Parliaments is responsible for arranging by-elections of hereditary peers when necessary. The deputies of the Clerk of the Parliaments (the Clerk Assistant and the Reading Clerk) are appointed by the Lord Speaker, subject to the House's approval.

The [[Black Rod|Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod]] is also an officer of the House; he takes his title from the symbol of his office, a black rod. Black Rod (as the Gentleman Usher is normally known) is responsible for ceremonial arrangements, is in charge of the House's doorkeepers, and may (upon the order of the House) take action to end disorder or disturbance in the Chamber. Black Rod also holds the office of [[Serjeant-at-Arms]] of the House of Lords, and in this capacity attends upon the Lord Speaker. The Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod's duties may be delegated to the Yeoman Usher of the Black Rod or to the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms.

==Procedure==
[[Image:House of Lords chamber, F. G. O. Stuart.jpg|thumb|right|Benches in the chamber are coloured red. In contrast, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is decorated in green.]]
[[File:Thrones in the House of Lords c1902.jpg|thumb|The royal thrones, c.&nbsp;1902]]
{{See also|Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom#Stages of a bill|label 1=stages of a bill section in Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom}}

The House of Lords and the House of Commons assemble in the [[Palace of Westminster]]. The Lords Chamber is lavishly decorated, in contrast with the more modestly furnished Commons Chamber. Benches in the Lords Chamber are coloured red. The Woolsack is at the front of the Chamber; the Government sit on benches on the right of the Woolsack, while members of the Opposition sit on the left. [[Crossbencher]]s, sit on the benches immediately opposite the Woolsack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso04.htm#a3|title=House of Lords briefing paper, A Guide to Business, page 3|accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref>

The Lords Chamber is the site of many formal ceremonies, the most famous of which is the [[State Opening of Parliament]], held at the beginning of each new parliamentary session. During the State Opening, the [[British monarchy|Sovereign]], seated on the Throne in the Lords Chamber and in the presence of both Houses of Parliament, delivers a speech outlining the Government's agenda for the upcoming parliamentary session.

In the House of Lords, members need not seek the recognition of the presiding officer before speaking, as is done in the House of Commons. If two or more Lords simultaneously rise to speak, the House decides which one is to be heard by acclamation, or, if necessary, by voting on a motion. Often, however, the Leader of the House will suggest an order, which is thereafter generally followed. Speeches in the House of Lords are addressed to the House as a whole ("My Lords") rather than to the presiding officer alone (as is the custom in the Lower House). Members may not refer to each other in the second person (as "you"), but rather use third person forms such as "the noble Duke", "the noble Earl", "the noble Lord", "my noble friend", "The most Reverend Primate", etc.

Each member may make no more than one speech on a motion, except that the mover of the motion may make one speech at the beginning of the debate and another at the end. Speeches are not subject to any time limits in the House; however, the House may put an end to a speech by approving a motion "that the noble Lord be no longer heard". It is also possible for the House to end the debate entirely, by approving a motion "that the Question be now put". This procedure is known as [[cloture|Closure]], and is extremely rare.

Once all speeches on a motion have concluded, or Closure invoked, the motion may be put to a vote. The House first votes by [[voice vote]]; the Lord Speaker or Deputy Speaker puts the question, and the Lords respond either "content" (in favour of the motion) or "not content" (against the motion). The presiding officer then announces the result of the voice vote, but if his assessment is challenged by any Lord, a recorded vote known as a [[division (vote)|division]] follows.

Members of the House enter one of two lobbies (the ''content'' lobby or the ''not-content'' lobby) on either side of the Chamber, where their names are recorded by clerks. At each lobby are two Tellers (themselves members of the House) who count the votes of the Lords. The Lord Speaker may not take part in the vote. Once the division concludes, the Tellers provide the results thereof to the presiding officer, who then announces them to the House.

If there is an equality of votes, the motion is decided according to the following principles: legislation may proceed in its present form, unless there is a majority in favour of amending or rejecting it; any other motions are rejected, unless there is a majority in favour of approving it. The quorum of the House of Lords is just three members for a general or procedural vote, and 30 members for a vote on legislation. If fewer than three or 30 members (as appropriate) are present, the division is invalid.

===Disciplinary powers===
By contrast with the House of Commons, the House of Lords has not until recently had an established procedure for putting sanctions on its members. When a [[2009 cash for influence scandal|cash for influence scandal]] was referred to the Committee of Privileges in January 2009, the [[Leader of the House of Lords]] also asked the Privileges Committee to report on what sanctions the House had against its members.<ref name="Reference to committee">{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldprivi/87/8703.htm|title=The Powers of the House of Lords in respect of its Members|publisher=House of Lords, Committee for Privileges|at=paragraph 2}}</ref> After seeking advice from the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] and the former [[Lord Chancellor]] [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|Lord Mackay of Clashfern]], the committee decided that the House "possessed an inherent power" to suspend errant members, although not to withhold a [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writ of summons]] nor to expel a member permanently.<ref name="Powers of suspension">{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldselect/ldprivi/87/8703.htm|title=The Powers of the House of Lords in respect of its Members|publisher=House of Lords, Committee for Privileges|at=paragraph 8}}</ref> When the House subsequently suspended [[Peter Truscott, Baron Truscott|Lord Truscott]] and [[Thomas Taylor, Baron Taylor of Blackburn|Lord Taylor of Blackburn]] for their role in the scandal, they were the first to meet this fate since 1642.<ref name="Taylor and Truscott suspended">{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Sparrow,|title='Sullied' members suspend two peers in first case since 1642|work=The Guardian|date=21 May 2009|page=6}}</ref>

Recent changes have expanded the disciplinary powers of the House. Section 3 of the [[House of Lords Reform Act 2014]] now provides that any member of the House of Lords convicted of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year loses their seat. The [[House of Lords (Expulsion and Suspension) Act 2015]] allows the House to set up procedures to suspend, and to expel, its members.

====Regulation of behaviour in the chamber====
There are two motions which have grown up through custom and practice and which govern questionable conduct within the House. They are brought into play by a member standing up, possibly intervening on another member, and moving the motion without notice. When the debate is getting excessively heated, it is open to a member to move "that the Standing Order on Asperity of Speech be read by the Clerk". The motion can be debated,<ref name="Asperity of speech">{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/ldctso06.htm#a61|title=Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the proceedings of the House of Lords|date=October 2006|at=paragraph 4.58|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> but if agreed by the House, the [[Clerk of the Parliaments]] will read out Standing Order 33 which provides "That all personal, sharp, or taxing speeches be forborn".<ref name="Standing Order 32">{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/105/105.pdf|title=The Standing Orders of the House of Lords|date=23 April 2015|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom}}</ref> The Journals of the House of Lords record only four instances on which the House has ordered the Standing Order to be read since the procedure was invented in 1871.<ref name="Asperity instances">See Lords Journal vol. CIII p. 629, vol. CIV p. 381, vol. 182 p. 90, and vol. 231 p. 644 and 648–9.</ref>

For more serious problems with an individual Lord, the option is available to move "That the noble Lord be no longer heard". This motion also is debatable, and the debate which ensues has sometimes offered a chance for the member whose conduct has brought it about to come to order so that the motion can be withdrawn. If the motion is passed, its effect is to prevent the member from continuing their speech on the motion then under debate.<ref name="No longer heard">{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/ldctso06.htm#a62|title=Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the proceedings of the House of Lords|date=October 2006|at=paragraphs 4.59 and 4.60}}</ref> The Journals identify eleven occasions on which this motion has been moved since 1884; four were eventually withdrawn, one was voted down, and six were passed.<ref name="No longer heard instances">See Lords Journal vol. CXVI p. 162, vol. CXXIII p. 354, vol. 192 p. 231, vol. 215 p. 200–1, vol. 218 p. 119, vol. 221 p. 539, vol. 225 p. 194, vol. 226 p. 339, vol. 228 p. 308, vol. 229 p. 89, and vol. 233 p. 791.</ref>

===Leave of absence===
In 1958, to counter criticism that some peers only appeared at major decisions in the House and thereby particular votes were swayed, the [[Standing Orders of the House of Lords]] were enhanced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldbrief/ldreform.htm|title=House of Lords – Reform and Proposals for Reform since 1900|accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref> Peers who did not wish to attend meetings regularly or were prevented by ill health, age or further reasons, were now able to request Leave of Absence.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=The Stationery Office|title =The House of Lords: Reform|year = 2007|ISBN=0-10-170272-8|page=12}}</ref> During the granted time a peer is expected not to visit the House's meetings until either its expiration or termination, announced at least a month prior to their return.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/faqs/house-of-lords-faqs/lords-members/|title=Parliament of the United Kingdom, Official Website – FAQ|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref>

===Attendance allowance===
Members of the House of Lords can, since 2010, opt to receive a £300 per day attendance allowance, plus limited travel expenses. Peers can elect to receive a reduced attendance allowance of £150 per day instead. Prior to 2010 peers from outside London could claim an overnight allowance of £174.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Members of the Lords: allowances|url = http://www.parliament.uk/about/mps-and-lords/about-lords/lords-allowances/|website = UK Parliament|accessdate = 2015-05-22}}</ref><ref name=telegraph-20150729>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/conservative/11769736/Peer-claims-300-a-day-in-expenses-to-walk-200-yards-to-work-at-House-of-Lords.html |title=Peer claims £300 a day in expenses to walk 200 yards to work at House of Lords |author=Michael Wilkinson |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=29 July 2015 |accessdate=4 April 2016}}</ref>

==Committees==
Unlike in the House of Commons, when the term committee is used to describe a stage of a bill, this committee does not take the form of a [[public bill committee]], but what is described as Committee of the Whole House. It is made up of all Members of the House of Lords allowing any Member to contribute to debates if he or she chooses to do so and allows for more flexible rules of procedure. It is presided over by the [[Chairman of Committees (House of Lords)|Chairman of Committees]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso11.htm#a134|title=Companion to the Standing orders of the House of Lords|page=138|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

The term committee is also used to describe Grand Committee, where the same rules of procedure apply as in the main chamber, except that no divisions may take place. For this reason, business that is discussed in Grand Committee is usually uncontroversial and likely to be agreed unanimously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso06.htm#a34|title=Companion to the Standing orders of the House of Lords|page=40|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

Public bills may also be committed to pre-legislative committees. A pre-legislative Committee is specifically constituted for a particular bill. These committees are established in advance of the bill being laid before either the House of Lords or the House of Commons and can take evidence from the public. Such committees are rare and do not replace any of the usual stages of a bill, including committee stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso11.htm#a112|title=Companion to the Standing orders of the House of Lords|page=128|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>

The House of Lords also has 15 [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committees]]. Typically, these are ''sessional committees'', meaning that their members are appointed by the House at the beginning of each session, and continue to serve until the next parliamentary session begins. In practice, these are often permanent committees, which are re-established during every session. These committees are typically empowered to make reports to the House "from time to time", that is, whenever they wish. Other committees are ''ad-hoc committees'', which are set up to investigate a specific issue. When they are set up by a motion in the House, the motion will set a deadline by which the Committee must report. After this date, the Committee will cease to exist unless it is granted an extension. One example of this is the Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/public-services-committee/role/|title=Ad-Hoc Committee on Public Service and Demographic Change|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> The House of Lords may appoint a chairman for a committee; if it does not do so, the Chairman of Committees or a Deputy Chairman of Committees may preside instead. Most of the Select Committees are also granted the power to co-opt members, such as the [[European Union Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/compso2010/ldctso14.htm#a249|title=Companion to the Standing orders of the House of Lords|page=214|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref> The primary function of Select Committees is to scrutinise and investigate Government activities; to fulfil these aims, they are permitted to hold hearings and collect evidence. Bills may be referred to Select Committees, but are more often sent to the Committee of the Whole House and Grand Committees.

The committee system of the House of Lords also includes several Domestic Committees, which supervise or consider the House's procedures and administration. One of the Domestic Committees is the Committee of Selection, which is responsible for assigning members to many of the House's other committees.

==Current composition==
{{Main|Members of the House of Lords}}
There are currently {{HOLtotal}} sitting members of the House of Lords.<ref name="lords_composition"/> An additional {{HOL ineligible}} Lords are ineligible from participation, including eight peers who are constitutionally disqualified as members of the Judiciary.<ref name="lords_ineligible"/>

The [[House of Lords Act 1999]] allocated 75 of the 92 hereditary peers to the parties based on the proportion of hereditary peers that belonged to that party in 1999:<ref name="standing_orders1"/>
* Conservative Party: 42 peers
* Labour Party: 2 peers
* Liberal Democrats: 3 peers
* Crossbenchers: 28 peers

Of the initial 42 [[hereditary peers]] elected as Conservatives, one ([[Leopold Verney, 21st Baron Willoughby de Broke|Lord Willoughby de Broke]]) now sits as [[United Kingdom Independence Party|UKIP]].<ref name="lords_composition"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/mps-lords-and-offices/lords/|title=Lists of Members of the House of Lords|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=21 June 2012|quote=Willoughby de Broke, Lord UK Independence Party}}</ref>

15 hereditary peers are elected by the whole House, and the remaining hereditary peers are the two royal office-holders, the [[Earl Marshal]] and the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], both being currently on leave of absence.<ref name="lords_composition"/>

A report in 2007 stated that many members of the Lords (particularly the life peers) do not attend regularly; the average daily attendance was around 408.<ref>{{cite book|title=The House of Lords: Reform|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7027/7027.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=25 May 2008|date=February 2007|publisher=[[The Stationery Office]]|location=London|isbn=978-0-10-170272-0|oclc=83593847|page=44|quote=taking the 2005–2006 session, the average attendance was around 408, or 56% of members.}}</ref>

While the number of hereditary peers is limited to 92, and that of Lords spiritual to 26, there is no maximum limit to the number of life peers who may be members of the House of Lords at any time.
