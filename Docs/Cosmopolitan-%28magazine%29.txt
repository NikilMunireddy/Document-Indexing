'''''Cosmopolitan''''' is an international fashion [[women's magazine|magazine for women]]. As '''''The Cosmopolitan''''' it was first published in 1886 in the United States as a family magazine, it was later transformed into a [[literary magazine]] and eventually became a women's magazine in the late 1960s. Also known as '''''Cosmo''''', its content as of 2011 included articles on women's issues, relationships, sex, health, careers, self-improvement, celebrities, fashion, and beauty. Published by [[Hearst Magazines]], ''Cosmopolitan'' has 64 international editions, is printed in 35 languages and is distributed in more than 110 countries.<ref name="hearst.com-aboutcosmo">{{cite web | url=http://www.hearst.com/magazines/cosmopolitan.php | title=Cosmopolitan: "Fun, Fearless, Female" | publisher=hearst.com | accessdate=January 13, 2013}}</ref>

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2013}}
''Cosmopolitan'' began as a family magazine, launched in 1886 by Schlicht & Field of New York as ''The Cosmopolitan''.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tassin |first=Algernon |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=December 1915 |title=The Magazine In America, Part X: The End Of The Century |journal=The Bookman: an Illustrated Magazine of Literature and Life |volume=XLII |issue=4 |pages=396–412 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=d04DAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA396 |accessdate=2008-08-03 |publisher=Dodd, Mead and Co. }}</ref>

Paul Schlicht told his first-issue readers that his publication was a "first-class family magazine", adding, "There will be a department devoted exclusively to the concerns of women, with articles on fashions, on household decoration, on cooking, and the care and management of children, etc. There was also a department for the younger members of the family."

''Cosmopolitan'''s circulation reached 25,000 that year, but by November 1888, Schlicht & Field were no longer in business. [[John Brisben Walker]] acquired the magazine in 1889. That same year, he dispatched [[Elizabeth Bisland]] on a race around the world against [[Nellie Bly]] to draw attention to his magazine.<ref name="marksbook">{{cite book|author=Marks, Jason|title=Around the World in 72 Days: The race between Pulitzer's Nellie Bly and Cosmopolitan's Elizabeth Bisland'' |publisher=Gemittarius Press |year=1993|isbn= 978-0-9633696-2-8}}</ref>

Under John Brisben Walker's ownership, E. D. Walker, formerly with ''Harper's Monthly'', took over as the new editor, introducing colour illustrations, serials and book reviews. It became a leading market for fiction, featuring such authors as [[Annie Besant]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Jack London]], [[Willa Cather]], and [[Edith Wharton]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ruiz,Michelle|title=Remembering Cosmo's Legendary Literary All-Stars|publisher=Cosmopolitan.com|date=September 2013|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/celebrity/news/famous-authors-cosmopolitan|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref> The magazine's circulation climbed to 75,000 by 1892.

In 1897, ''Cosmopolitan'' announced plans for a free correspondence school: "No charge of any kind will be made to the student. All expenses for the present will be borne by the ''Cosmopolitan''. No conditions, except a pledge of a given number of hours of study." When 20,000 immediately signed up, Walker could not fund the school and students were then asked to contribute 20 dollars a year. Also in 1897, [[H. G. Wells]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' was serialized, as was his ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'' (1900). [[Olive Schreiner]] contributed a lengthy article about the [[Boer War]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In 1905, [[William Randolph Hearst]] purchased the magazine for [[US$]]400,000 ({{Inflation|US|400,000|1905|r=-3|fmt=eq}}) and brought in journalist [[Charles Edward Russell]], who contributed a series of investigative articles, including "The Growth of Caste in America" (March 1907),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} "At the Throat of the Republic" (December 1907 - March 1908) and "What Are You Going to Do About It?" (July 1910 - January 1911),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} and "Colorado - New Tricks in an Old Game" (December 1910).{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Other contributors during this period included [[O. Henry|O.Henry]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Henry|first=O|title=Dream|url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/1466/|publisher=Read Book Online website|accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref> [[A. J. Cronin]], [[Alfred Henry Lewis]], [[Bruno Lessing]], [[Sinclair Lewis]], [[David Graham Phillips]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Upton Sinclair]], and [[Ida Tarbell]]. [[Jack London]]'s novella, "[[The Red One]]", was published in the October 1918 issue<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jacklondons.net/Fiction_of_jack_london/page31.html|website=Jacklondons.net|title=Fiction of Jack London|page=31|accessdate=January 6, 2013}}</ref> (two years after London's death<ref>{{cite news|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0112.html|title=On This Day: November 23, 1916: OBITUARY - Jack London Dies Suddenly On Ranch|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref>), and a constant presence from 1910-18 was [[Arthur B. Reeve]], with 82 stories featuring [[Craig Kennedy]], the "scientific detective". Magazine illustrators included Francis Attwood, [[Dean Cornwell]], [[Harrison Fisher]], and [[James Montgomery Flagg]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
[[File:CosmopolitanMagazineMarch1894.jpg|right|thumbnail|150px|right|March 1894 issue]]

Hearst formed [[Cosmopolitan Productions]] (also known as Cosmopolitan Pictures), a film company based in New York City from 1918 to 1923, then Hollywood until 1938, for the purpose of making films from stories published in the magazine.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

''Cosmopolitan'' magazine was officially titled as ''Hearst's International Combined with Cosmopolitan'' from 1925 until 1952, but was simply referred to as ''Cosmopolitan''. In 1911, Hearst had bought a middling monthly magazine called ''World To-Day'' and renamed it ''Hearst's Magazine'' in April 1912. In June 1914 it was shortened to ''Hearst's'' and was ultimately titled "Hearst's International" in May 1922. In order to spare serious cutbacks at [[Hearst Castle|San Simeon]], Hearst merged the magazine ''Hearst's International'' with ''Cosmopolitan'' effective March 1925. But while the ''Cosmopolitan'' title on the cover remained at a [[typeface]] of eight-four [[Point (typography)|points]], over time span the typeface of the ''Hearst's International'' decreased to thirty-six points and then to a barely legible twelve points. After Hearst died in 1951, the ''Hearst's International'' disappeared from the magazine cover altogether in April 1952.<ref>{{cite book |last= Landers|first= James |year= 2010|title=The Improbable First Century of Cosmopolitan Magazine |url= |location= |publisher= [[University of Missouri Press]]|isbn= 9780826272331|accessdate= |pages = 169–213 }}</ref>

With a circulation of 1,700,000 in the 1930s, ''Cosmopolitan'' had an advertising income of $5,000,000. Emphasizing fiction in the 1940s, it was subtitled ''The Four-Book Magazine'' since the first section had one novelette, six or eight short stories, two serials, six to eight articles and eight or nine special features, while the other three sections featured two novels and a digest of current non-fiction books. During World War II, sales peaked at 2,000,000.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The magazine began to run less fiction during the 1950s. Circulation dropped to slightly over a million by 1955, a time when magazines were overshadowed during the rise of paperbacks and television. The Golden Age of magazines came to an end as [[mass market]], general interest publications gave way to special interest magazines targeting specialized audiences.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Helen Gurley Brown arrives===
''Cosmopolitan'''s circulation continued to decline for another decade until [[Helen Gurley Brown]] became [[chief editor]] in 1965 and remodeled the magazine as ''New Cosmopolitan'' and re-invented it as a magazine for modern single career women.<ref name=changed>{{cite journal|author=Benjamin, Jennifer|title=How Cosmo Changed the World|publisher=Cosmopolitan|date=September 2009|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world|accessdate=January 13, 2013}}</ref> In 1967, the magazine reclaimed the name ''Cosmopolitan''. The magazine eventually adopted a cover format consisting of a usually young female model (in recent years, an actress, singer or another prominent female celebrity), typically in a low cut dress, [[bikini]] or some other revealing outfit. The magazine set itself apart by frankly discussing sex from the point of view that women could and should enjoy sex without guilt. The first issue under Helen Gurley Brown featured an article on the (then new) [[birth control pill]].<ref name=changed/>

This was not Brown's first publication dealing with sexually liberated women. Her 1962 advice book, ''[[Sex and the Single Girl]]'', had been a bestseller.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Fan mail begging for Brown's advice on many subjects concerning women's behavior, sexual encounters, health, and beauty flooded her after the book was released. Brown sent the message that a woman should have men complement her life, not take it over. Enjoying sex without shame was also a message she incorporated in both publications.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gianoulis, Tina |title="Cosmopolitan."

In Brown's early years as editor, the magazine received heavy criticism. The magazine ran a near-nude centerfold of actor [[Burt Reynolds]] in April 1972, causing great controversy and attracting much attention.<ref name="Willett2010">{{cite book|author=Julie Willett|title=The American Beauty Industry Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CljLw4sH2DMC&pg=PA77|accessdate=13 January 2013|date=11 May 2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-35949-1|page=77}}</ref>

In April 1978, a single edition of ''Cosmopolitan Man'' was published as a trial, targeted to appeal to men. Its cover featured [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[Aurore Clément]]. It was published twice in 1989 as a supplement to ''Cosmopolitan''.<ref>[http://www.magforum.com/mens/mensmagazinesatoz2.htm "Men's magazines: an A to Z"], Magforum.com, accessed November 6, 2006</ref> Hearst abandoned this project after the company purchased ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==''Cosmopolitan'' today==
[[File:COSMOPOLITAN magazine at The Brandery Summer Edition 2010.jpg|thumb|Cosmopolitan stand at [[The Brandery]] fashion show (Barcelona, 2010)]]
The magazine, and in particular its cover stories, have become increasingly sexually explicit in tone, and covers have models wearing revealing clothes. [[Kroger]], the largest grocery chain in the United States, used to cover up ''Cosmopolitan'' at checkout stands because of complaints about sexually inappropriate headlines.<ref name="kroger_coverup">[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/2000/01/12/2000-01-12_the_ticker.html New York Daily News - The Ticker], ''New York Daily News''.  {{wayback|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/2000/01/12/2000-01-12_the_ticker.html |date=20110602193012 }}</ref>
The UK edition of ''Cosmopolitan'', which began in 1972, was the first Cosmopolitan magazine to be branched out to another country. It was well known for sexual explicitness, with strong sexual language, male nudity and coverage of such subjects as rape. In 1999 ''[[Cosmogirl|CosmoGIRL!]]'', a spinoff magazine targeting a teenage female audience, was created for international readership. It shut down in December 2008.

The magazine currently features topics including sex, relationships, beauty, fashion and health. The advice and feature articles in the US edition are written to a presumed audience of white women.<ref name=mcmahon>{{cite journal|title=The "Cosmopolitan" Ideology and the Management of Desire|author=Kathryn McMahon|pages=381–396|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3812809|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=27|number=3|date=August 1990|doi=10.1080/00224499009551567}}</ref>

''Cosmopolitan'' has 64 international editions worldwide published in 35 languages with distribution in more than 100 countries making ''Cosmopolitan'' the largest-selling young women's magazine in the world.<ref name="hearst.com-aboutcosmo" /> Some international editions are published in partnerships, such as licenses or joint ventures, with established publishing houses in each local market.

''Cosmopolitan'' has since the sixties been a women's magazine discussing such topics as sex, health, fitness and fashion. ''Cosmopolitan'' also has a section called "Ask Him Anything" where a male writer answers readers' questions about men and dating.

Over 3,000,000 people subscribe to ''Cosmopolitan.''

;Practice Safe Sun
In the May 2006 issue of ''Cosmopolitan'', the magazine launched the Practice Safe Sun campaign, an initiative aimed at fighting skin cancer by asking readers to stop all forms of tanning other than tanning from a bottle.<ref name="allbusiness.com">[http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4775142-1.html Cosmo to Promote 'Safe Skin' | Business solutions from AllBusiness.com]  {{wayback|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4775142-1.html |date=20090328102238 }}</ref> In conjunction with the campaign, ''Cosmo's'' editor-in-chief, Kate White, approached Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), known for her support of women's health issues, with concerns that women weren't fully aware of the dangers of indoor tanning and the effectiveness of the current warning labels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4775142-1.html |title=Cosmo to Promote 'Safe Skin' &#124; Mediaweek &#124; Professional Journal archives from |publisher=AllBusiness.com |date=2006-04-10 |accessdate=2011-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090328102238/http://www.allbusiness.com:80/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4775142-1.html |archivedate=March 28, 2009 }}</ref> After careful review, the Congresswoman agreed that it was necessary to recommend that the FDA take a closer look.

;Cosmopolitan, The Fragrance
In May 2015, Cosmopolitan UK announced they were launching their first ever fragrance. This is considered a first in the magazine industry. Named 'Cosmopolitan, The Fragrance', the perfume takes on the notion of their much-loved phrase 'Fun, Fearless Female' and is set to launch in September.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cosmofragrance.net/gb/ |title=The Home of Cosmopolitan, The Fragrance |publisher=Cosmo Fragrance |date= |accessdate=2015-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hearst.co.uk/news/cosmopolitan-launches-cosmopolitan-fragrance |title=Cosmopolitan launches Cosmopolitan The Fragrance - Hearst UKHearst UK |publisher=Hearst.co.uk |date=2015-05-26 |accessdate=2015-10-16}}</ref>

== Politics ==
In September 2014, ''Cosmopolitan'' began endorsing political candidates. The endorsements are based on "established criteria" agreed upon by the magazine's editors. Specifically, ''Cosmopolitan'' will only endorse candidates that support [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay laws]], legal [[abortion]], free [[contraceptives]], [[gun control]] and oppose [[voter identification law]]s. Amy Odell, editor of Cosmopolitan.com, has stated that under no circumstances will the magazine endorse a political candidate that is [[pro-life]]: "We’re not going to endorse someone who is pro-life because that’s not in our readers’ best interest.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Journalism/2014/09/05/Cosmo-To-Endorse-Political-Candidates-So-Old-White-Guys-Sitting-in-D-C-Don-t-Have-Control-Over-Women|title=Cosmo to Endorse Political Candidates, and No Pro-Lifers Allowed|last=Berry|first=Susan|date=6 September 2014|publisher=[[Breitbart (website)|Breitbart]]|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref> According to Joanna Coles, the magazine's [[Editor-in-chief|Editor-in-Chief]], the endorsements of ''Cosmopolitan'' will focus on "candidates in [[swing state]]s or candidates who are strongly in favor of issues like contraception coverage or gun control."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/the-new-cosmo-love-sex-politics-110586.html|title=The new Cosmo: Love, sex, politics? |publisher=Politico |date=2014-09-04 |accessdate=2014-09-07}}</ref> In the [[United States elections, 2014|2014 U.S. elections]], ''Cosmopolitan'' officially endorsed twelve [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidates.

== Criticism ==
In its January 1988 issue, ''Cosmopolitan'' ran a feature claiming that women had almost no reason to worry about contracting [[HIV]] long after the best available medical science indicated otherwise. The piece claimed that unprotected sex with an [[HIV-positive]] man did not put women at risk of infection and went on to state that "most heterosexuals are not at risk" and that it was impossible to transmit HIV in the [[missionary position]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newyorkmetro.com/news/features/17158/index2.html |title=AIDS in New York: A Biography - New York Magazine |publisher=Newyorkmetro.com |date=2006-06-05 |accessdate=2011-11-16}}</ref> This article angered many knowledgeable people, including [[AIDS]] and [[gay rights]] activists.{{According to whom|date=July 2014}}

Whilst considered a magazine for adult women, ''Cosmopolitan'' has been accused of subtly targeting children.<ref name=FN>{{cite web|work=[[Fox News]]|title=Victoria Hearst says her family's ''Cosmopolitan'' magazine "pornographic", joins campaign to get it brown bagged|first=Hollie|last=McKay|date=September 6, 2012|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/09/06/victoria-hearst-says-her-family-cosmopolitan-magazine-pornographic-joins/}}</ref> Former model Nicole Weider accused the magazine of using slang "which is used by young people not adults" and using (then) underage celebrities, such as [[Demi Lovato]] and [[Selena Gomez]], as well as other celebrities popular with teens such as [[Ashley Greene]] and [[Dakota Fanning]], in an attempt to gain the attention of underage girls.<ref name=FN/>

Victoria Hearst, a granddaughter of [[William Randolph Hearst]] (founder of ''Cosmopolitan'''s parent company) and sister of [[Patty Hearst]], has lent her support to a campaign which seeks to have ''Cosmopolitan'' classified as harmful under the guidelines of "Material Harmful to Minors" laws. Hearst, the founder of an evangelical Colorado church called Praise Him Ministries<ref>{{cite web|url=http://praisehimministries.org/index.htm}}</ref> states that "the magazine promotes a lifestyle that can be dangerous to women’s emotional and physical well being. It should never be sold to anyone under 18".<ref name=FN/> Donald Clark, the secretary of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), has also shown interest in the matter.<ref name=FN/>

''Cosmopolitan'' was criticized by Katie Yoder of the [[Campaign Life Coalition]] for its September 2014 decision to exclude pro-life candidates in its endorsements, stating "Yes, Cosmo deeply cares about 'all young women.' Minus those pro-life women voters, women candidates – and unborn females, of course."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/pulse/cosmo-mag-set-to-endorse-candidates-says-pro-life-is-a-deal-breaker|title=Cosmo Mag set to endorse candidates, says pro-life is a ‘deal breaker’|last=Yoder|first=Katie|date=4 September 2014|publisher=[[LifeSiteNews.com]]|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref>
