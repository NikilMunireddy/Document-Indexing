'''Indie rock''' is a genre of [[alternative rock]] that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock was extremely diverse, with subgenres that include [[indie pop]] and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with [[alternative rock]]. As [[grunge]] and [[punk revival]] bands in the US, and then [[Britpop]] bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, a number of indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.

In the mid-1980s, the term "indie" began to be used to describe the music produced on [[punk rock|punk]] and [[post-punk]] labels.<ref name=BrownandVolgsten2006p.194>S. Brown and U. Volgsten, ''Music and Manipulation: on the Social Uses and Social Control of Music'' (Berghahn Books, 2006), ISBN 1-84545-098-1, p. 194.</ref> A number of prominent [[Independent record label|indie rock record labels]] were founded during the 1980s. During the 1990s, [[Grunge]] bands broke into the mainstream, and the term "alternative" lost its original counter-cultural meaning. The term "indie rock" became associated with the bands and genres that remained dedicated to their independent status.<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> By the end of the 1990s indie rock developed a number of subgenres and related styles. Following [[indie pop]] these included lo-fi, [[noise pop]], [[emo]], [[sadcore]], [[post-rock]] and [[math rock]].<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> In the 2000s, changes in the music industry and in music technology enabled a new wave of indie rock bands to achieve mainstream success.<ref name="N.

In the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped-down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream. The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands: [[The Strokes]], [[The White Stripes]], [[The Hives]] and [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]].

==Characteristics==
The term indie rock, which comes from "independent," describes the small and relatively low-budget [[independent record label|label]]s on which it is released and the [[DIY ethic|do-it-yourself]] attitude of the bands and artists involved. Although distribution deals are often struck with major corporate companies, these labels and the bands they host have attempted to retain their autonomy, leaving them free to explore sounds, emotions and subjects of limited appeal to large, mainstream audiences.<ref name=AllMusicIndie>{{Citation | last =| title = Indie rock | journal = Allmusic| date = |url =http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d2687| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5wTaUVdId| archivedate =13 February 2011}}.</ref> The influences and styles of the artists have been extremely diverse, including [[punk rock|punk]], [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]], [[post-punk]] and [[country music|country]].<ref name=BrownandVolgsten2006p.194/> The terms "[[alternative rock]]" and "indie rock" were used interchangeably in the 1980s, but after many alternative bands followed [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] into the mainstream in the early 1990s, "indie rock" began to be used to describe those bands, working in a variety of styles, that did not pursue or achieve commercial success.<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> Aesthetically speaking, indie rock is characterized as having a careful balance of pop accessibility with noise, experimentation with pop music formulae, sensitive lyrics masked by ironic posturing, a concern with "authenticity," and the depiction of a simple guy or girl.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Henry|first1=Stephen|last2=Novara|first2=Vincent J|title=Sound Recording Review: A Guide to Essential American Indie Rock (1980–2005)|journal=Notes – Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association|date=2009|volume=65|issue=4|pages=816–33}}</ref>

''Allmusic'' identifies indie rock as including a number of "varying musical approaches [not] compatible with mainstream tastes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/indie-rock-ma0000004453|title=Indie Rock – Significant Albums, Artists and Songs – AllMusic|work=AllMusic}}</ref> Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged, grunge-influenced bands, through do-it-yourself experimental bands like [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], to punk-folk singers such as [[Ani DiFranco]].<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative>S.

Connell and C. Gibson, ''Sound Tracks: Popular Music, Identity, and Place'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2003), ISBN 0-415-17028-1, pp. 101–3.</ref>

Indie rock has been identified as a reaction against the ''macho'' culture that developed in [[alternative rock]] in the aftermath of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s success.<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> Indie rock is noted for having a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the development of the feminist-informed [[Riot Grrrl]] music of acts like [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[7 Year Bitch]], [[Team Dresch]] and [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]].<ref>M. Leonard, ''Gender in the Music Industry: Rock, Discourse and Girl Power'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ISBN 0-7546-3862-6, p. 2.</ref> However, Cortney Harding pointed out that this sense of equality is not reflected in the number of women running indie labels.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = UpFront: The Indies - Where the Girls Aren't: Why Aren't More Women Running Indie Labels|last = Harding|first = Cortney|date = October 13, 2007|journal = Billboard - The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref>

==History==

===Origins: Late 70s and 1980s===

====College rock and noise rock====
{{Main|College rock|Noise rock}}
[[File:Jesus and Mary Chain 2007.jpg|thumb|[[The Jesus and Mary Chain]] performing in California in 2007]]
The BBC documentary 'Music for Misfits: The Story of Indie' <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06g64wb/episodes/guide|title=Music for Misfits: The Story of Indie - Episode guide - BBC Four|website=BBC|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> pinpoints the birth of indie as the 1977 self-publication of the [[Spiral Scratch (EP)|Spiral Scratch EP]] by Manchester band [[Buzzcocks]]. Although Buzzcocks are often classified as a punk band it has been argued by the BBC and others <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.23indie.com/indiemusicdefined.html|title=A definition of indie music|website=www.23indie.com|access-date=2016-03-21}}</ref> that the publication of Spiral Scratch independently of a major label led to the coining of the name 'indie' ('indie' being the shortened form of 'independent').  

In the mid-1980s, the term "indie" began to be used to describe the music produced on [[post-punk]] labels rather than the labels themselves.<ref name="BrownandVolgsten2006p.194" /> The indie rock scene in the US was prefigured by the [[college rock]]<ref>A. Earles, ''Husker Du: The Story of the Noise-Pop Pioneers Who Launched Modern Rock'' (Voyageur Press, 2010), ISBN 0-7603-3504-4, p. 140.</ref> that dominated [[Campus radio|college radio]] playlists, which included key bands like [[R.E.M.]] from the US and [[The Smiths]] from the UK.<ref name="AMCollegeRock">{{Citation | last =| title = College rock | journal = Allmusic| date = |url =http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d11971| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5yHMmSJur| archivedate =27 April 2011}}.</ref> These bands rejected the dominant [[synthpop]] of the early 1980s,<ref>{{Citation | last =S.

In the United States, the term was particularly associated with the abrasive, distortion-heavy sounds of the [[Pixies]], [[Hüsker Dü]], [[Minutemen (band)|Minutemen]], [[Meat Puppets]], [[Dinosaur Jr.]], and [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]].<ref name="AMCollegeRock" />

The most abrasive and discordant outgrowth of punk was [[noise rock]], which emphasised loud distorted electric guitars and powerful drums, and was pioneered by bands including [[Sonic Youth]], [[Swans (band)|Swans]], [[Big Black]] and [[Butthole Surfers]].<ref>{{Citation | last =| title = Noise Rock | journal = Allmusic| date = |url =http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/noise-rock-d2925| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5yLE0mhdZ| archivedate =30 April 2011}}.</ref> A number of prominent [[Independent record label|indie rock record labels]] were founded during the 1980s.

====Indie pop====
{{Main|Indie pop}}
In the United Kingdom the ''[[C86 (music)|C86]]'' cassette, a 1986 ''[[NME]]'' compilation featuring [[Primal Scream]], [[The Pastels]], [[The Wedding Present]] and other bands, was a document of the UK indie scene at the start of 1986. It gave its name to the [[indie pop]] scene that followed, which was a major influence on the development of the British [[Indie music scene|indie scene]] as a whole.<ref>{{Citation | last =M.

The Jesus and Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr, [[indie pop]] and the [[dream pop]] of [[Cocteau Twins]], were the formative influences for the [[shoegazing]] movement of the late 1980s. Named for the band members' tendency to stare at their feet and guitar [[effects pedal]]s onstage rather than interact with the audience, acts like [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], and later [[Slowdive]] and [[Ride (band)|Ride]] created a loud "wash of sound" that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback.<ref name=AMShoegaze>{{Citation | last = | title = Shoegaze | journal = Allmusic| date = |url = http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/shoegaze-d2680 | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5wjkalKMT| archivedate =24 February 2011}}.</ref> The other major movement at the end of the 1980s was the drug-fuelled [[Madchester]] scene. Based around [[The Haçienda]], a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and [[Factory Records]], Madchester bands such as [[Happy Mondays]] and [[The Stone Roses]] mixed [[acid house]] dance rhythms, [[Northern soul]] and [[funk]] with melodic guitar pop.<ref>{{Citation | last =| title = Madchester | journal = Allmusic | date = |url =http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d4391| archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5yJmvXX5F| archivedate =27 April 2011}}.</ref>

===Development: 1990s===

====Alternative enters the mainstream====
{{Main|Alternative rock}}
[[File:Stevemalkmus(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|Pavement singer/guitarist [[Stephen Malkmus]]]]
The 1990s brought major changes to the alternative rock scene. [[Grunge]] bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Hole (band)|Hole]], and [[Alice in Chains]] broke into the mainstream, achieving commercial chart success and widespread exposure.<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> [[Punk revival]] bands like [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]] also became popular and were grouped under the "alternative" umbrella.<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/> Similarly, in the United Kingdom [[Britpop]] saw bands like [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] emerge into the mainstream, abandoning the regional, small-scale and political elements of the 1980s [[Indie pop|indie]] scene.<ref>A. Bennett and J. Stratton, ''Britpop and the English Music Tradition'' (Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing, 2010), ISBN 0-7546-6805-3, p. 93.</ref>

As a result of alternative rock bands moving into the mainstream, the term "alternative" lost its original counter-cultural meaning and began to refer to the new, commercially lighter form of music that was now achieving mainstream success. It has been argued that even the term "sellout"  lost its meaning as grunge made it possible for a niche movement, no matter how radical, to be co-opted by the mainstream, cementing the formation of an individualist, fragmented culture.<ref name="Swanson">C. Swanson [http://nymag.com/arts/art/features/1993-new-museum-exhibit/ "Are We Still Living in 1993?"], retrieved 26 February 2013.</ref> This theory hypothesizes staying independent became a career choice for bands privy to industry functions rather than an ideal, as the principle of resistance to the market evaporated in favor of a more synergistic culture.<ref name="Swanson"/>

The term "indie rock" became associated with the bands and genres that remained dedicated to their independent status.<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> Even grunge bands, following their break with success, began to create more independent sounding music, further blurring the lines.<ref name="Swanson"/> Ryan Moore has argued that in the wake of the appropriation of alternative rock by the corporate music industry that what became known as indie rock increasingly turned to the past to produce forms of "retro" rock that drew on [[garage rock]], [[rockabilly]], [[blues]], [[country music|country]] and [[swing music|swing]].<ref>R. Moore, ''Sells Like Teen Spirit: Music, Youth Culture, and Social Crisis'' (New York: New York University Press, 2009), ISBN 0-8147-5748-0, p. 11.</ref>

====Diversification====
By the end of the 1990s indie rock developed a number of subgenres and related styles. Following [[indie pop]] these included lo-fi, noise pop, sadcore, post-rock, space rock and math rock.<ref name=AllMusicIndie/> [[Lo-fi music|Lo-fi]] eschewed polished recording techniques for a D.I.Y. ethos and was spearheaded by [[Beck]], [[Sebadoh]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]],<ref name=Bogdanov2002USAlternative/> who were joined by eclectic folk and rock acts of the [[The Elephant 6 Recording Company|Elephant 6]] collective, including [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], [[Elf Power]] and [[of Montreal]].<ref>D. Walk, "The Apples in Stereo: Smiley Smile", ''CMJ New Music'', Sep 1995 (25), p. 10.</ref> The work of [[Talk Talk (band)|Talk Talk]] and [[Slint]] helped inspire [[post-rock]] (an experimental style influenced by [[jazz]] and [[electronic music]], pioneered by [[Bark Psychosis]] and taken up by acts such as [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]], [[Stereolab]], and [[Laika (band)|Laika]]),<ref name="S. Taylor, 2006 pp. 154-5">S.

[[Space rock]] looked back to progressive roots, with drone-heavy and minimalist acts like [[Spacemen 3]] in the 1980s, [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]] and [[Spiritualized]], and later groups including [[Flying Saucer Attack]], [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] and [[Quickspace]].<ref>{{Citation | last = | title =Space rock| journal = Allmusic| date = | url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/space-rock-d2784 | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5wUOtn84J| archivedate =14 February 2011}}.</ref> In contrast, [[sadcore]] emphasized pain and suffering through melodic use of acoustic and electronic instrumentation in the music of bands like [[American Music Club]] and [[Red House Painters]],<ref>{{Citation | last = | title =Sadcore| journal = Allmusic| date = |url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d4588|pure_url=yes}} | archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5wUP1oqYG | archivedate =14 February 2011}}.</ref> while the revival of [[Baroque pop]] reacted against lo-fi and experimental music by placing an emphasis on melody and classical instrumentation, with artists like [[Arcade Fire]], [[Belle & Sebastian]] and [[Rufus Wainwright]]. [[Weezer]]'s ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996) introduced the genre to a wider and more mainstream audience.<ref>{{Citation | last =S. T.

===Signs of commercial interest: 2000s===
In the 2000s, the changing music industry, the decline in record sales, the growth of new digital technology and increased use of the Internet as a tool for music promotion, allowed a new wave of indie rock bands to achieve mainstream success.<ref name="N. Abebe"/> Existing indie bands that were now able to enter the mainstream included more musically and emotionally complex bands<ref name=Spitz2010>M.

In the early 2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped-down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock emerged into the mainstream.

The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands: [[The Strokes]], who emerged from the New York club scene with their début album ''[[Is This It]]'' (2001); [[The White Stripes]], from Detroit, with their third album ''[[White Blood Cells (album)|White Blood Cells]]'' (2001); [[The Hives]] from Sweden, after their compilation album ''[[Your New Favourite Band]]'' (2001); and [[The Vines (band)|The Vines]] from Australia with ''[[Highly Evolved]]'' (2002).<ref>P.

====Emo====
{{Main|Emo}}
Emo also broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s, with the platinum-selling success of [[Jimmy Eat World]]'s ''[[Bleed American]]'' (2001) and [[Dashboard Confessional]]'s ''[[The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most]]'' (2001).<ref name="DeRogatis2003"/> The new emo had a more refined sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations.<ref name=DeRogatis2003/> At the same time, use of the term "emo" expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion.<ref>{{Citation | last = H.

====Landfill Indie====
By the end of the 2000s the proliferation of indie bands was being referred to as "indie landfill",<ref name="T.

However, there continued to be commercial successes like [[Kasabian]]'s ''[[West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum]]'' (2009), which reached number one in the UK.<ref>{{Citation | last = G.
