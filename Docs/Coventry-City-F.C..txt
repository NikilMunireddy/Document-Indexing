'''Coventry City Football Club''' is a professional [[association football]] club based in the city of [[Coventry]], [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England. The team compete in [[Football League One|League One]], the third tier of the [[English football league system]].

Coventry City, which was formed as '''Singers F.C.''' in 1883, joined the [[Football League]] in 1919. They won their only major trophy in 1987 when they beat Tottenham Hotspur 3–2 to win the [[FA Cup]] in a match listed by the FA as one of the twelve classic FA Cup Finals.<ref name="Classic Cup Finals">{{cite web|title = Classic Cup Finals|publisher=[[The Football Association]]|url = http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1987CoventryTottenham| accessdate =8 August 2008}}</ref> They are one of only five clubs to have ever won the FA Cup and [[FA Youth Cup]] 'double' in the same season and they also reached two [[Football League Cup]] semi-finals, in 1981 and 1990.

The club, which is nicknamed the ''Sky Blues'' owing to the colour of their strip, was an inaugural member of the [[Premier League]] in 1992 and had spent 34 consecutive seasons (since 1967) in the English top flight prior to their relegation in 2001. Following eleven seasons in the second-tier [[Football League Championship]] without any significant success, Coventry were relegated to [[Football League One]] in 2012, the first time in 48 years that the club played in the English league system's third tier.

Coventry has only qualified for European competition once, during the 1970–71 season, when they competed in the European Fairs Cup (now the [[UEFA Europa League]]), reaching the second round. Despite beating [[Bayern Munich]] 2–1 in their home leg, they had lost 1–6 in the first leg in Munich to go out of the competition. They were unable to compete in the 1987–88 [[UEFA Cup Winner's Cup]] due to the ban on English clubs at that time.

From 1899 to 2005, Coventry City played at the [[Highfield Road (stadium)|Highfield Road]] stadium. In 1981 it became the first all-seater stadium in English football, though by the late-1990s the club's directors decided it was time to construct a larger stadium and chose a site in the Rowley's Green area of the city. The 32,609-capacity [[Ricoh Arena]] was opened in August 2005, but following a rent dispute with the ground's owners the club opted to play their home games at [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]]'s [[Sixfields Stadium]] starting in the 2013–14 season. A return to the Ricoh Arena was announced on 21 August 2014 by the club after a one-year absence.

==Playing kit==

===Colours===
Coventry's home shirts are either completely or predominately sky blue. However, in past seasons, different 'home colours' were worn. For example, in 1889, the then Singers FC wore pink and blue halved shirts (mirroring the corporate colours of Singers Motors). Furthermore, in the 1890s, black and red were the club's colours. In the early 1920s, the club wore red and green (to reflect the colours of the city crest). Sky blue was first used by Coventry in 1898 and the theme was used until 1922. Variations of blue and white were then used until the 1960s and the beginning of the 'sky blue revolution'. The colour made its return in 1962 thanks to the then manager, Jimmy Hill. To mark the 125th year of the club, Coventry wore a special brown shirt in the last home game of the 2008–09 season against Watford, having first worn a chocolate brown away kit in 1978. This kit has been cited by some as the worst in English football history, but also has an iconic status with some fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/transfer-news/coventrys-infamous-chocolate-brown-kit-4066416|title=Look: Coventry's infamous chocolate brown kit named as the worst strip in English football history|work=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, in the [[2011–12 FA Cup#Third round proper|Third round]] [[FA Cup]] tie versus Southampton, the team wore a commemorative blue and white striped kit, marking the 25th anniversary of the club winning the FA Cup in [[1987 FA Cup Final|1987]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/07/coventry-city-southampton-fa-cup|title=Coventry fans protest as Southampton dump home side out of FA Cup|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=7 January 2012|accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref> The strip was worn again in January 2013 for Coventry's [[2012–13 FA Cup#Third round proper|3rd round]] FA Cup fixture with Tottenham Hotspur, whom they beat in the 1987 final.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jan/04/coventry-tottenham-fa-cup-final-1987|title=Coventry head to Tottenham awash with memories of their finest hour|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Daniel|last=Taylor|date=4 January 2013|accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref>

===Kit maker and sponsorship===
As of the [[2015–16 Football League One|2015–16]] season, the kit is made by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] (via Just Sport Group – Nike's official affiliate). The home kit is sponsored by Allsopp & Allsopp.

The first official kit manufacture deal came in 1974, when [[Umbro]] signed a deal with the club. Coventry also had the first kit sponsorship deal in the football league, when Jimmy Hill, then Chairman of the club, negotiated a deal with [[Talbot]], who manufactured cars in the city.

===106 years at Highfield Road===
[[File:Highfield Road Stadium 22April04.jpg|thumb|Coventry City played at [[Highfield Road]] between 1899 and 2005]]
Coventry City began playing at the [[Highfield Road]] stadium in 1899 within the Hillfields district of the city, although the club did not buy the freehold to the site until 1937. The ground had an interesting history. In 1940 the main stand which backed onto terraced houses in Mowbray Street was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]], heavy turnstiles from the ground and gas meters from houses in Mowbray Street were discovered in Gosford Park, some 500 metres away.

The record crowd at the ground was on 29 April 1967 when 51,455 watched the Second Division title decider against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. This was more than 6,000 more than the previous record set against [[Aston Villa F.C|Aston Villa]] in 1938. Many people who were at that game suggest the attendance was a lot higher, possibly over 60,000. Supporters climbed onto the roofs of the stands and up the floodlights.

In 1968, the main stand burnt down and its replacement was built within four months.

In 1981, Highfield Road was converted into England's first ever [[all-seater stadium]] with a capacity of around 24,500, which many criticised as killing the atmosphere of the ground. Some seats were removed a few years later.<ref name="100yearshighfieldroad">{{cite web|url=http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/history/highfield-road-100-years.htm|title=100 Years of Highfield Road|work=cwn.org.uk|first=Jim|last=Brown|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> It had been gradually upgraded since then, with the final phase of work being completed in the mid-1990s, including two fully enclosed corners, providing some much-needed modernity. On 30 April 2005, the final game played at the stadium was against Midlands rivals [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]; Coventry won with a scintillating 6–2 scoreline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/coventry-city-anniversary-highfield-road-3314226|title=LOOK: Eight years today since Coventry City left Highfield Road|work=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=30 April 2005|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref> The stadium was subsequently demolished and replaced by a housing development.

===Relocating to the Ricoh Arena===
For the 2005–06 season, Coventry City moved to the new 32,609-capacity [[Ricoh Arena]] after 106 years at Highfield Road.<ref name="history"/><ref name="skysportsprofile">{{cite news|title=Coventry City Factfile: Ricoh Arena | url=http://www.skysports.com/football/venue/0,19753,11065_5,00.html | accessdate=4 August 2008 | publisher=[[Sky Sports]]}}</ref> In 1998, the club had decided that it was time to relocate to a new stadium in the Rowleys Green area of the city, three-and-a-half miles north of the city centre and close to junction 3 of the [[M6 motorway]]. The original plan was for a state-of-the-art, 45,000-seater multipurpose stadium with removable pitch and retractable roof. It was due to be ready for the 2001–02 season and was touted to be one of the finest and most advanced stadiums in Europe. However, the club's subsequent relegation, financial problems, financier/contractor withdrawals and England's failure to secure the 2006 World Cup competition led to a radical redesign. The resulting stadium was built to a standard bowl design with steep stands, in line with several other new stadia built during that period, though it has excellent acoustics and has been used to host several major rock concerts.

Despite initiating the project and being the principal attraction there, Coventry City's financial situation means that they no longer own the stadium and must pay rent to use it; this could appear to raise concerns over the managing of the club's finances by previous club officials, as in 2001 the club were the fourth-longest serving club in the top flight of English football. The stadium naming rights were originally sold to [[Jaguar Cars]], which has strong links with Coventry. Jaguar pulled out of the project on 16 December 2004 and a new major sponsor was needed. A £10&nbsp;million deal, which included naming rights, was signed and electronics manufacturer [[Ricoh]] became the new chief sponsor for the stadium. The project was funded largely by [[Coventry City Council]] and the (Alan Edward) Higgs Charity (of which former CCFC and ACL director the late Sir [[Derek Higgs]] was a trustee), and includes shopping facilities, a casino, exhibition halls and a concert venue.

At the beginning of the 2005–06 season, construction delays at the ground forced Coventry City to play their first three games of the season away and postpone their home games. On Saturday 20 August 2005, City hosted [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the first-ever game at the Ricoh Arena; Coventry won the game 3–0. On 28 July 2011, a statue of [[Jimmy Hill]] was installed at the main entrance to the Ricoh Arena, with Hill appearing in person to unveil it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-14328753|title=Jimmy Hill statue unveiled at Coventry's Ricoh Arena|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>

===2013 rent row and ground relocation===
[[File:Sixfieldsstadium.JPG|thumb|Rent disputes caused Coventry City to play the 2013–14 season at [[Sixfields Stadium]] in [[Northampton]]]]
On 3 May 2013, Coventry City put a contingency plan in place to play elsewhere for the 2013–14 season. It was argued by the club that this was due to ACL (Arena Coventry Limited), who manage the stadium, being unwilling to negotiate with the club to agree a new lease. However, this  led to the local newspaper, the ''[[Coventry Telegraph]]'', starting a petition in order to try stopping Coventry City from playing outside of Coventry. It was sent to all 72 clubs in the Football League and also the Football League chairman. In May 2013, managing director Tim Fisher set a plan of building a new stadium within the city over the next three years and ground-sharing whilst the new ground is being built.<ref name="Highfield Road II">{{cite web|title=Owners of Sky Blues planning to build Highfield Road II 'just outside' city | url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/football-news/coventry-city-planning-build-highfield-4003689 | accessdate=23 May 2013 | publisher=''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''}}</ref> In June 2013, ACL made an offer that Coventry City F.C. could play at the Ricoh Arena rent free while the club was in administration.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22856508 |title=BBC Sport – Coventry City given 'play for free' offer at Ricoh Arena |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 June 2013 |accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>

On 21 August 2014 it was announced an agreement had been reached allowing the club to return to the [[Ricoh Arena]] for the next two years with the option of another two years.<ref>{{cite web|title = Coventry City agree deal to return to the Ricoh Arena|publisher=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|url =http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/watch-coventry-city-agree-deal-7620919 | accessdate =16 September 2015}}</ref> Coventry City's first home game at the [[Ricoh Arena]] was played against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]] on 5 September 2014.

The return followed a social media campaign entitled #bringCityhome by the ''[[Coventry Telegraph]]'' <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/news-opinion/telegraph-comment-time-bring-coventry-7385463|title=Time to bring Coventry City home|date=7 July 2014|publisher=Coventry Telegraph|accessdate=16 September 2015|type=News article}}</ref> and a protest march by the Sky Blue Trust supporters' group.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/coventry-streets-flooded-sky-blue-7413024|title=Streets flooded with Sky Blue as supporters send out clear message|date=12 July 2014|publisher=Coventry Telegraph|accessdate=16 September 2015|type=News article}}</ref> The campaign drew praise from national media and figures within the football world.

==Supporters==

===Former Players' Association===
In February 2007 a Former Players' Association was launched. Set up by club historian and statistician Jim Brown, former 1980s player [[Kirk Stephens]] and a committee of volunteers, its aim was to bring former players of the club together and cherish their memories. To qualify for membership players have to have made at least one first team competitive appearance for the club or been a manager.

Around 50 former stars of the club attended the launch including Coventry City legends [[George Hudson (footballer)|George Hudson]], [[Cyrille Regis]], [[Charlie Timmins]] and [[Bill Glazier]]. The association's first newsletter was published in autumn 2007 and a website launched. The launch of 2007 was followed by subsequent Legends' Days. The 2009 event, held at the home game against [[Doncaster Rovers]] was attended by 43 former players including the first visit to Coventry for many years of [[Roy Barry]] and [[Dave Clements]]. In March 2012 the membership had increased past the 200 mark with former captain [[Terry Yorath]] inducted as the 200th member at the 2012 Legends' Day.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

===Sky Blue Trust===
The Sky Blue Trust is a [[supporters' trust]] for Coventry City F.C.; it was originally founded in 2003 as part of a national initiative under the auspices of the umbrella group, [[Supporters Direct]]. The Sky Blue Trust, like trusts at other clubs, is a legally based, independent, democratic supporters' group with membership open to all. One of the Sky Blue Trust's greatest achievements was raising funds to save the football club's Youth Academy which was threatened with closure.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} By 2009/2010, however, the trust had become moribund.<ref name="trust1">{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2012/05/09/new-coventry-city-fans-group-set-up-to-replace-sky-blue-trust-92746-30926857/|title=New Coventry City fans group set up to replace Sky Blue Trust|publisher=''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''|first=Martin|last=Bagot|date=9 May 2012|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> Given the ongoing financial uncertainty at Coventry City, the trust was re-launched in the summer of 2012.<ref name="trust1"/><ref name="trust2">{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2012/06/01/coventry-city-s-sky-blue-trust-to-be-reborn-92746-31093827/|title=Coventry City's Sky Blue Trust to be reborn|publisher=''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''|first=Martin|last=Bagot|date=1 June 2012|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> A new board for the trust was elected and from having less than 20 members the trust grew to over 700 within three months,TV pundit [[John McCririck]] is a well known member of the trust.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The key aim of the Sky Blue Trust is to obtain a financial stake in Coventry City F.C. and have at least one democratically elected trust member on the club's board, meaning that supporters have a direct say in the running of the club.<ref name="trust3">{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2012/06/13/reformed-coventry-city-fans-group-pushing-scheme-for-supporters-to-buy-stake-in-club-92746-31169222/|title=Reformed Sky Blue Trust wants 'fans to buy stake in Coventry City'|publisher=''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''|first=Martin|last=Bagot|date=13 June 2012|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="trust4">{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2012/06/19/coventry-city-fans-debate-plan-to-buy-stake-in-sky-blues-92746-31210499/|title=Coventry City fans debate plan to buy stake in Sky Blues|publisher=''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''|first=Martin|last=Bagot|date=19 June 2012|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="Sky Blue Trust&nbsp;— about">{{cite web|url=http://www.skybluetrust.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=48&Itemid=57|title=Sky Blue Trust – About The Trust – Our Aims & Objectives|work=skybluetrust.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref>

==='SISU Out' protesters===
In August 2011, after Coventry City fans became tired of cost-cutting by SISU, Coventry fans started to protest for the removal of SISU. Protests took place at the Jimmy Hill Statue at the Ricoh Arena before games but limited numbers turned out. However, after these games the number of protesters grew and so did the number of banners. After protesting near the rear entrance, the fans moved into the lobby and start chanting "SISU OUT" at which point a large number of "security response guards" moved in to remove the protesters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/2011/08/22/coventry-city-fans-stage-protests-outside-london-s-sisu-hq-and-ricoh-arena-92746-29279725/|title=Coventry City fans stage protests outside London's Sisu HQ and Ricoh Arena (videos)|publisher=''[[Coventry Telegraph]]''|first=Martin|last=Bagot|date=22 August 2011|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref>

===Sky Blue anthem===
The words to the club's song were written in 1962 by Team Manager [[Jimmy Hill]] and Director John Camkin; The words being set to the tune of the [[Eton Boating Song]].<ref name="anthem">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-20826566|title=Sky Blue Song 50th anniversary marked at Coventry City|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|date=22 December 2012|accessdate=17 August 2013}}</ref> It was launched at the home game with Colchester on 22 December 1962 (a match abandoned at half-time because of fog) with the words printed in the programme.<ref name="anthem"/> It quickly became popular with supporters during the epic FA Cup run in 1963 when the then Third Division team reached the quarter-finals of the [[FA Cup]] before losing to eventual winners [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]:

==Rivalries==
As of 2012, Coventry fans consider [[Leicester City]], with whom they contest the [[M69 derby]] to be their main rivals. [[Aston Villa]] are the club's traditional rivals but in recent years this has become somewhat one-sided rivalry as the latter have several stronger local rivalries. A lesser rivalry also exists with [[Birmingham City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedaisycutter.co.uk/2012/09/football-rivalries-the-survey/ |title=Football Rivalries: The Survey |publisher=The Daisy Cutter |date= |accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref> In the 1960s and early 1970s Wolves were the biggest local rivalries, and the teams had some classic games during that era, including the 1967 game at [[Highfield Road]] when 51,452 watched a 3–1 Coventry win, which ultimately meant the Sky Blues pipped Wolves to the Second Division title.

==In Popular Culture==
In a second-season episode of [[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] first aired in December 1970, the team is mentioned in the "World Forum/Communist Quiz" sketch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monty Python: Communist Quiz|url=http://www.montypython.net/scripts/com-quiz.php|website=MontyPython.net}}</ref> A host ([[Eric Idle]]) asks four socialist leaders ([[Karl Marx]], [[Lenin]], [[Che Guevara]] & [[Mao Tse-Tung]]) the last time Coventry City won the FA Cup. After receiving no guesses, the host responds that it was a trick question and that Coventry City have never won the FA Cup. This sketch first aired 17 years before Coventry's 1987 FA Cup victory.
