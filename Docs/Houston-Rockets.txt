The '''Houston Rockets''' are an American professional basketball team based in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. The Rockets compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), as a member club of the league's [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Toyota Center]], located in [[downtown Houston]]. The Rockets have won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. The team was established as the '''San Diego Rockets''', an [[expansion team]] originally based in [[San Diego|San Diego, California]], in 1967. In 1971, the Rockets [[Relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Houston.

The Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the [[1969 NBA Draft]], the Rockets selected [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Elvin Hayes]] [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall]], who would lead the team to its first [[1969 NBA Playoffs|playoff]] appearance in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record until the 1976–77 season, when they traded for [[center (basketball)|center]] [[Moses Malone]]. Malone went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) award twice and lead Houston to the [[NBA Conference Finals|conference finals]] in [[1976–77 NBA season|his first year]] with the team. He also led the Rockets to the [[NBA Finals]] in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]] where they were defeated in six games by the [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]] and future Rockets coach [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]].

In [[1984 NBA Draft|1984]], the Rockets drafted center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], who would be paired with {{convert|7|ft|4|inch|m}} [[Ralph Sampson]], forming one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the "Twin Towers", they led the team to the [[1986 NBA Finals]]—the second NBA Finals berth in franchise history—where Houston was again defeated by the Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the second round for the rest of the decade. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] took over as head coach midway through the 1991–92 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. The Rockets would reach the [[1994 NBA Finals]], where Olajuwon led the team to the franchise's first championship against [[Patrick Ewing]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. The team repeated as champions in [[1995 NBA Finals|1995]] as the sixth seed in the West and swept the favored [[Orlando Magic]], who were led by a young [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and  [[Penny Hardaway]]. Houston became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title.

The Rockets acquired all-star [[power forward (basketball)|forward]] [[Charles Barkley]] in 1996, but the presence of three of the NBA's 50 greatest players of all-time (Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley) was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001, and the Rockets of the early 21st century, led by superstars [[Tracy McGrady]] and [[Yao Ming]], followed the trend of consistent regular-season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster. The acquisitions of franchise players [[James Harden]] and [[Dwight Howard]] have launched the Rockets back into championship contention in the mid-2010s. The Rockets, under general manager [[Daryl Morey]], are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to [[sabermetrics]] in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.

Early in the 1987–88 season, Sampson, who had signed a new contract, was traded to the Golden State Warriors, bringing the Twin Towers era to an end just 18 months after their Finals appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/features/an-oral-history-hakeem-olajuwon-ralph-sampson-1980s-houston-rockets/|title=The Greatest Team That Never Was|publisher=Grantland|author=Abrams, Jonathan|date=November 8, 2012|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> Sampson's once-promising career was shortened due to chronic knee injuries, which forced his retirement in 1991.

Still, the duo was plagued with injuries - of the 463 regular season games for which they were teammates, Yao missed 146 and McGrady 160 - and did not win any playoff series, despite gathering leads over the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in [[2005 NBA Playoffs|2005]] and the Jazz in [[2007 NBA Playoffs|2007]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/2010/news/features/fran_blinebury/12/08/tracy-mcgrady-houston-return/ |title=Failures, injuries mark T-Mac's memories of paring with Yao|date=December 8, 2010|publisher=NBA.com|author=Blinebury, Fran |accessdate=February 23, 2016}}</ref> After the 2007 elimination, Van Gundy was fired,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/sports/rockets/article/Van-Gundy-dismissed-as-Rockets-coach-1837998.php |title=Van Gundy dismissed as Rockets coach |last=Feigen |first=Jonathan |date=May 18, 2007 |work=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=February 23, 2009}}</ref> and the Rockets hired [[Rick Adelman]] to replace him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/sports/rockets/article/Adelman-reaches-deal-to-coach-Rockets-1629681.php |title=Adelman reaches deal to coach Rockets |last=Feigen |first=Jonathan |date=May 21, 2008 |work=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=February 23, 2009}}</ref>

During the four years the Rockets were in San Diego, they played their games in the [[San Diego Sports Arena]],<ref name="chronhistory" /> which had a [[seating capacity]] of 14,400.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/uniontrib/20080909/news_1m9arena.html|author=Varga, George |title=Arm of entertainment giant taking over at Sports Arena |date=September 9, 2008 |work=San Diego Union-Tribune |accessdate=February 27, 2009}}</ref> In their first season after moving to Houston, the Rockets did not have their own arena, and they played their first two years at various venues in the city, including the [[Astrodome]], [[Reliant Park#Reliant Arena|AstroHall]], [[Sam Houston Coliseum]] and [[Hofheinz Pavilion]], the latter eventually being adopted as their home arena until 1975. They also had to play "home" games in other cities such as [[San Antonio]], [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], and even San Diego in efforts to extend the fan-base. During their first season, the Rockets averaged less than 5,000 fans per game (roughly half full), and in one game in Waco, there were only 759 fans in attendance.<ref name="chronhistory" />

Their first permanent arena in Houston was the 10,000 seat Hofheinz Pavilion on the campus of the [[University of Houston]], which they moved into starting in their second season. They played in the arena for four years, before occupying [[Lakewood Church Central Campus|The Summit]] in 1975.

==Team identity==

===Uniforms and logos===
When the Rockets debuted in San Diego, their colors were green and gold. Road uniforms featured the city name, while the home uniforms feature the team name, both in a serifed block lettering. This was the only uniform design the Rockets would use throughout their years in San Diego. The Rockets' first logo featured a rocket streaking with a basketball surrounded by the team name.<ref name=breitbard/>

Upon moving to Houston in 1971, the Rockets replaced green with red.<ref name=uniforms/> They kept the same design from their San Diego days, save for the change of color and city name. The logo used is of a player with a spinning basketball launching upward, with boosters on his back, leaving a trail of red and gold flames and the words "Houston Rockets" below it.<ref name=uniforms/>

For the 1972–73 season, the Rockets introduced the famous "mustard and ketchup" logo, so dubbed by fans, featuring a gold basketball surrounded by two red trails, with "Houston" atop the first red trail and "Rockets" (all [[capitalization|capitalized]] save for the lowercase 'E' and 'T') in black surrounding the basketball. The initial home uniforms, used until the 1975–76 season, features the city name, numbers and serifed player name in red with gold trim, while the away uniforms feature the city name (all capitalized except for the lower case 'T' and 'N'), numbers and serifed player name in gold with white trim.<ref name=uniforms/>

In the 1976–77 season, the Rockets modified their uniforms, featuring a monotone look on the [[Cooper Black]] fonts and white lettering on the road uniforms. On the home shorts, the team logo is located on the right leg, while the away shorts feature the team name wordmark on the same location. With minor modifications in the number font, this version was used in all four of their NBA Finals appearances, including their {{nbafy|1994}} and {{nbafy|1995}} championships.<ref name=uniforms/>

Following the 1995 title, the Rockets opted to modernize their look. After a fan contest with over 5,000 entries, the team went with the idea of [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]] artist Thomas Nash of a rocket orbiting a basketball, which was then reworked by Houston designer Chris Hill.<ref>{{cite news|title=Out with the old, In with the new|author=Barron, David|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=June 29, 1995}}</ref> Nash would later sue the Rockets for [[breach of contract]], given they were using his idea despite not having paid the contest prizes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/06/27/Franchises/ROCKETS-WIN-LOGO-SUIT-BUT-STILL-MAY-HAVE-TO-PAY-ARTIST.aspx|title=ROCKETS WIN LOGO SUIT BUT STILL MAY HAVE TO PAY ARTIST|date=June 27, 1997|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120061258/http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archivedate=November 20, 2015|title=Nash v.

Red was retained, but navy blue and silver became the uniform's primary colors. Both the home white and away navy uniforms featured gradient-fading pinstripes and futuristic number fonts, with side stripes of navy fading to red. This was used until the 2002–03 season.<ref name=uniforms/><ref name=intown>{{cite journal|url=http://www.intownmag.com/2003/August2003/html/Rockets2003.html |title=Rocket Science |author=Devadanam, Steven |journal=In Town Magazine |publisher=Houston Chamber of Commerce |date=August 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041121152350/http://www.intownmag.com/2003/August2003/html/Rockets2003.html |archivedate=November 21, 2004 }}</ref>

The Rockets' current logos and uniforms were introduced in the 2003–04 season,<ref name="fashion" /> created by New York-based agency Alfafa Studio in association with Japanese designer [[Eiko Ishioka]]. The logo is a stylized 'R' in the shape of a rocket during [[takeoff]], surrounded by a red orbit streak that can be interpreted as the central circle of a basketball court. Said "R" inspired the team's new custom typeface, designed so that every single digit could be read well from a distance, whether in the arena or on television. Red once again became the dominant color, with silver and black as secondary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alfalfastudio.com/projects/houston-rockets/|title=Houston Rockets|publisher=Alfafa Studio|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/sports/rockets/article/Rockets-settle-on-new-logo-2124612.php|title=Rockets settle on new logo|first=David|last=Barron |date=July 8, 2003|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> In 2009, the Rockets invoked the championship years with an alternate red uniform, featuring gold numbers and side stripes.<ref name=ketchup>{{cite web|last=Friedman|first=Jason|title=Rockets Unveil Alternate Jersey|url=http://www.nba.com/rockets/news/rocketsunveilalternatejersey_2009_09_23.html|publisher=Houston Rockets|date=September 24, 2009|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/sports/rockets/article/Rockets-new-alternate-jerseys-have-look-of-a-1604531.php|title=Rockets' new alternate jerseys have look of a champion|first=Jordan|last=Godwin |date=November 6, 2009|work=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref> The Rockets had two sleeved alternate jerseys for the 2015-16 season, an alternate silver-colored uniform whose design referenced the design of NASA's [[Titan II GLV|Gemini-Titan rocket]], and a red and gold jersey featuring the nickname "Clutch City".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/13667253/houston-rockets-unveil-three-alternate-uniforms|title=Rockets display trio of new alternates, including 'Clutch City' design|date=September 16, 2015|first=Paul|last=Lukas|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}</ref>

===Mascots===
The [[mascot]] of the Houston Rockets in the 1980s was called Booster. From 1993 to 1995, the mascot was Turbo, a costumed man that performed acrobatic dunks and other maneuvers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/rockets/mascot/turbo.html|title=ROCKETS: Turbo|publisher=|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> In 1995, the Rockets debuted [[Clutch (mascot)|Clutch the Bear]] as a second mascot, a large teddy bear-like mascot that performs a variety of acts during the games. After eight years of serving as dual mascots, the performer playing Turbo retired, making Clutch the sole mascot for the team.<ref>{{cite news |first=Craig |last=Hlavaty |publisher=[[Houston Press]] |title=Mascot School: How To Entertain, And What About Having To Pee? |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/news/mascot-school-how-to-entertain-and-what-about-having-to-pee-6721127 |date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref>

===Rivalries===

===Retained draft rights===
The Rockets hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm|title=NBA Salary Cap FAQ – 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement|quote=If the player is already under contract to, or signs a contract with a non-NBA team, the team retains the player's draft rights for one year after the player's obligation to the non-NBA team ends.
