'''Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle''' [[Venerable Order of Saint John|KStJ]], [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]] (22 May 1859&nbsp;– 7 July 1930) was a British writer and physician, most noted for creating the fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] and writing stories about him which are generally considered milestones in the field of [[crime fiction]].

He is also known for writing the fictional adventures of a second character he invented, [[Professor Challenger]], and for popularising the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''. He was a prolific writer whose other works include fantasy and science fiction stories, plays, romances, poetry, non-fiction and historical novels.

==Name==
Doyle is often referred to as "Sir Arthur Conan Doyle" or simply "Conan Doyle" (implying that Conan is part of a compound surname, as opposed to his [[Given name|given]] middle name). His baptism entry in the register of [[St Mary's Cathedral, Edinburgh (Roman Catholic)|St Mary's Cathedral]], Edinburgh gives "Arthur Ignatius Conan" as his given names, and "Doyle" as his surname. It also names Michael Conan as his [[godparent|godfather]].<ref>Stashower says that the compound version of his surname originated from his great-uncle Michael Conan, a distinguished journalist, from whom Arthur and his elder sister, Annette, received the compound surname of "Conan Doyle" (Stashower 20–21). The same source points out that in 1885 he was describing himself on the brass nameplate outside his house, and on his doctoral thesis, as "A. Conan Doyle" (Stashower 70). However, the 1901 census indicates that Conan Doyle's surname was "Doyle", leading some sources to assert that the form "Conan Doyle" was used as a surname only in his later years.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}</ref> The cataloguers of the [[British Library]] and the [[Library of Congress]] treat "Doyle" alone as his surname.<ref>

Steven Doyle, editor of the ''Baker Street Journal'', has written: "Conan was Arthur's middle name. Shortly after he graduated from high school he began using Conan as a sort of surname. But technically his last name is simply 'Doyle'."<ref>Steven Doyle & David A.

In 1882 he joined former classmate George Turnavine Budd as his partner at a medical practice in [[Plymouth]], but their relationship proved difficult, and Doyle soon left to set up an independent practice.<ref Name="NDB"/><ref>Stashower, pp. 52–59.</ref> Arriving in [[Portsmouth]] in June 1882 with less than £10 (£{{Inflation|UK|10|1882|r=-2}} today{{Inflation-fn|UK}}) to his name, he set up a medical practice at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, [[Southsea]].<ref>Stashower, pp. 55, 58–59.</ref> The practice was initially not very successful. While waiting for patients, Doyle again began writing fiction.

In 1890 Doyle studied ophthalmology in [[Vienna]], and moved to London, first living in Montague Place and then in South Norwood. He set up a practice as an [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologist]] at No. 2 Upper Wimpole St, London W1 (then known as 2 Devonshire Place).<ref>Stashower, p. 118.</ref> (A Westminster Council plaque in place over the front door can be seen today.)

==Literary career==

===Sherlock Holmes===
[[File:Sherlock Holmes Portrait Paget.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Portrait of Sherlock Holmes by Sidney Paget, 1904]]
Doyle struggled to find a publisher for his work. His first work featuring Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', was taken by [[Ward Lock & Co]] on 20 November 1886, giving Doyle £25 (£{{Inflation|UK|25|1886|r=-2}} today) for all rights to the story. The piece appeared one year later in the ''[[Beeton's Christmas Annual]]'' and received good reviews in ''[[The Scotsman]]'' and the ''[[Glasgow Herald]]''.<ref Name="NDB"/>

Holmes was partially modelled on his former university teacher [[Joseph Bell]]. In 1892, in a letter to Bell, Doyle wrote, "It is most certainly to you that I owe Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;... round the centre of deduction and inference and observation which I have heard you inculcate I have tried to build up a man."<ref>[http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/reviews/conan-doyle-and-joseph-bell-the-real-sherlock-holmes-surgeons-hall-museums-edinburgh-410821.html Independent, 7 August 2006];</ref> and, in his 1924 autobiography, he remarked, "It is no wonder that after the study of such a character [viz., Bell] I used and amplified his methods when in later life I tried to build up a scientific detective who solved cases on his own merits and not through the folly of the criminal.<ref>Doyle, Arthur Conan, ''Memories and Adventures'' (Reprint), Cambridge University Press, (Cambridge) 2012, p.26.</ref> [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] was able, even in faraway [[Samoa]], to recognise the strong similarity between [[Joseph Bell]] and Sherlock Holmes: "My compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes.&nbsp;... can this be my old friend Joe Bell?"<ref>Letter from R L Stevenson to Doyle 5 April 1893 [[s:The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 2/Chapter XII|The Letters of Robert Louis Stevenson Volume 2/Chapter XII]].</ref> Other authors sometimes suggest additional influences—for instance, the famous [[Edgar Allan Poe]] character [[C. Auguste Dupin]].<ref>Sova, Dawn B. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z''. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001. pp. 162–163.

A sequel to ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' was commissioned and ''[[The Sign of the Four]]'' appeared in ''[[Lippincott's Magazine]]'' in February 1890, under agreement with the Ward Lock company. Doyle felt grievously exploited by Ward Lock as an author new to the publishing world and he left them.<ref Name="NDB"/> Short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes were published in the ''[[Strand Magazine]]''. Doyle wrote the first five Holmes short stories from his office at 2 Upper Wimpole Street (then known as Devonshire Place), which is now marked by a memorial plaque.<ref>[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques City of Westminster green plaques]; accessed 22 March 2014.</ref>

Doyle's attitude towards his most famous creation was ambivalent.<ref name="Life" />  In November 1891 he wrote to his mother: "I think of slaying Holmes,... and winding him up for good and all. He takes my mind from better things." His mother responded, "You won't! You can't! You mustn't!"<ref>{{cite book|title=An Introduction to the Detective Story|last=Panek|first=LeRoy Lad|year=1987|publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press|location=Bowling Green, OH|isbn=0-87972-377-7|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xstGp7cOObMC&pg=PA78|accessdate=4 January 2012}}</ref>  In an attempt to deflect publishers' demands for more Holmes stories, he raised his price to a level intended to discourage them, but found they were willing to pay even the large sums he asked.<ref name="Life" />  As a result, he became one of the best-paid authors of his time.

In December 1893, to dedicate more of his time to his historical novels, Doyle had Holmes and [[Professor Moriarty]] plunge to their deaths together down the [[Reichenbach Falls]] in the story "[[The Final Problem]]". Public outcry, however, led him to feature Holmes in 1901 in the novel ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.

In 1903, Doyle published his first Holmes short story in ten years, ''[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]'', in which it was explained that only Moriarty had fallen; but since Holmes had other dangerous enemies—especially [[Colonel Sebastian Moran]]—he had arranged to also be perceived as dead. Holmes was ultimately featured in a total of 56 [[short story|short stories]]—the last published in 1927—and four novels by Doyle, and has since appeared in [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|many novels and stories by other authors]].

[[Jane Stanford]] compares some of Moriarty's characteristics to those of the [[Fenian]] [[John O'Connor Power]]. 'The Final Problem' was published the year the Second [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Home Rule Bill]] passed through the House of Commons. 'The Valley of Fear' was serialised in 1914, the year Home Rule, the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Government of Ireland Act]] (18 September) was placed on the Statute Book.<ref>Stanford Jane, ''That Irishman: The Life and Times of John O'Connor Power'', pp. 30, 124–127, History Press Ireland, May 2011; ISBN 978-1-84588-698-1</ref>

===Other works===
Doyle's first novels were ''[[The Mystery of Cloomber]]'', not published until 1888, and the unfinished ''[[The Narrative of John Smith|Narrative of John Smith]]'', published only in 2011.<ref name="johnsmith">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13667508|last=Saunders|first=Emma|publisher=BBC|title=First Conan Doyle novel to be published|date=6 June 2011|accessdate=6 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607112947/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13667508| archivedate= 7 June 2011|deadurl=no}}</ref> He amassed a portfolio of short stories including "The Captain of the Pole-Star" and "[[J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement]]", both inspired by Doyle's time at sea. The latter popularised the mystery of the ''[[Mary Celeste]]''<ref name="hastings">[[Macdonald Hastings]], ''Mary Celeste'', (1971); <!-- pages needed -->ISBN 0-7181-1024-2</ref> and added fictional details such as the perfect condition of the ship (which had actually taken on water by the time it was discovered) and its boats remaining on board (the one boat was in fact missing) that have come to dominate popular accounts of the incident.<ref Name="NDB"/><ref name="hastings"/> Doyle's spelling of the ship's name as ''Marie Celeste'' has become commoner in everyday use than the original form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/mary-celeste|title=Mary Celeste - definition of Mary Celeste in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=}}</ref>

Between 1888 and 1906, Doyle wrote seven historical novels, which he and many critics regarded as his best work.<ref name="Life" />  He also authored nine other novels, and later in his career (1912-1929) five stories, two of novella length, featuring the irascible scientist [[Professor Challenger]]. The Challenger stories include what is probably his best-known work after the Holmes oeuvre, ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''. He was a prolific author of short stories, including two collections set in [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic times]] featuring the French character [[Brigadier Gerard]].

Doyle's stage works include ''Waterloo'', the reminiscences of an English veteran of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the character of Gregory Brewster being written for [[Henry Irving]]; ''The House of Temperley'', the plot of which reflects his abiding interest of boxing; ''The Speckled Band'', after the [[The Speckled Band|short story]] of that name; and the 1893 collaboration with [[J.M. Barrie]] on the ''[[libretto]]'' of ''[[Jane Annie]]''.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E0CE3DD103BEF33A2575BC2A9639C94629ED7CF "''Jane Annie'' — J.M.

==Sporting career==
While living in [[Southsea]], Doyle played [[Association football|football]] as a goalkeeper for Portsmouth Association Football Club, an amateur side, under the pseudonym A. C. Smith.<ref>{{cite book|title=Full-Time at The Dell|last=Juson|first=Dave|author2=Bull, David|publisher=Hagiology Publishing|year=2001|isbn=0-9534474-2-1|page=21}}</ref> (This club, disbanded in 1896, has no connection with the present-day [[Portsmouth F.C.]], which was founded in 1898.) Doyle was a keen [[cricket]]er, and between 1899 and 1907 he played 10 [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches for the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). He also played for the amateur cricket team the [[Allahakbarries]] alongside authors [[J. M. Barrie]] and [[A. A. Milne]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8662375.stm "What is the connection between Peter Pan, Sherlock Holmes, Winnie the Pooh and the noble sport of cricket?]. BBC.

His highest score, in 1902 against [[London County Cricket Club|London County]], was 43. He was an occasional bowler who took just one first-class wicket (although one of the highest pedigree—it was [[W. G. Grace]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1900S/1900/ENG_LOCAL/OTHERS/LONDON-CO_MCC_23-25AUG1900.html |title=London County v Marylebone Cricket Club at Crystal Palace Park, 23–25 Aug 1900 |publisher=Static.cricinfo.com |accessdate=2 March 2010}}</ref> Also a keen golfer, Doyle was elected captain of the Crowborough Beacon Golf Club in [[Sussex]] for 1910.

In 1885 Doyle married Mary Louise (sometimes called "Touie") Hawkins, the youngest daughter of J. Hawkins, of [[Minsterworth]], [[Gloucestershire]], and sister of one of Doyle's patients.

Following the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] in South Africa at the turn of the 20th century and the condemnation from some quarters over the United Kingdom's role, Doyle wrote a short work titled ''The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct'', which argued that the UK's role in the Boer War was justified, and which was widely translated.

Doyle was a supporter of the campaign for the reform of the [[Congo Free State]], led by the journalist [[E. D. Morel]] and diplomat [[Roger Casement]]. During 1909 he wrote ''[[The Crime of the Congo]]'', a long pamphlet in which he denounced the horrors of that colony. He became acquainted with Morel and Casement, and it is possible that, together with [[Bertram Fletcher Robinson]], they inspired several characters in the 1912 novel ''[[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Spiring, Paul|url=http://www.bfronline.biz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=123&Itemid=9|title=B.

Doyle was also a fervent advocate of justice and personally investigated two closed cases, which led to two men being exonerated of the crimes of which they were accused. The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British, half-Indian lawyer named [[George Edalji]] who had allegedly penned threatening letters and mutilated animals in [[Great Wyrley]]. Police were set on Edalji's conviction, even though the mutilations continued after their suspect was jailed.<ref>''International Commentary on Evidence'', Volume 4, Issue 2 2006 Article 3, Boxes in Boxes: Julian Bardes, Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and the Edalji Case, D. Michael Risinger</ref> Apart from helping George Edalji, Doyle's work helped establish a way to correct other miscarriages of justice, as it was partially as a result of this case that the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]] was established in 1907.<ref>''International Commentary on Evidence'', Volume 4, Issue 2 2006 Article 3, Boxes in Boxes: Julian Barnes, Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and the Edalji Case, D. Michael Risinger</ref>

The story of Doyle and Edalji was dramatised in an episode of the 1972 BBC television series, ''The Edwardians''. In Nicholas Meyer's pastiche ''[[The West End Horror]]'' (1976), Holmes manages to help clear the name of a shy [[Parsi]] Indian character wronged by the English justice system. Edalji was of Parsi heritage on his father's side. The story was fictionalised in [[Julian Barnes]]'s 2005 novel ''[[Arthur and George]]'', which was adapted into a three-part drama by ITV in 2015.

The second case, that of [[Oscar Slater]], a [[Yekke]] and gambling-den operator convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in [[Glasgow]] in 1908, excited Doyle's curiosity because of inconsistencies in the prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was not guilty. He ended up paying most of the costs for Slater's successful appeal in 1928.<ref>{{cite book|title=Famous Trials|volume=1|last1=Roughead|first1=William|contribution=Oscar Slater|page=108|editor1-last=Hodge|editor1-first=Harry|publisher=Penguin Books|authorlink=William Roughead|year=1941}}</ref>

==Spiritualism, Freemasonry==
[[File:Cottingley Fairies 1.jpg|thumb|left|One of the five photographs of Frances Griffiths with the [[Cottingley Fairies|alleged fairies]], taken by Elsie Wright in July 1917]]
Doyle had a longstanding interest in [[Mysticism|mystical]] subjects.  In 1887 he joined the [[Society for Psychical Research]] and was also initiated as a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] (26 January 1887) at the Phoenix Lodge No. 257 in Southsea. He resigned from the Lodge in 1889, but returned to it in 1902, only to resign again in 1911.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner10.html|title=Arthur Conan Doyle, Spiritualist and Freemason|last=Beresiner|first=Yasha|date=2007|work=Masonic papers|publisher=PIETRE-STONES REVIEW OF FREEMASONRY|accessdate=13 March 2015}}</ref>

Following the death of his wife Louisa in 1906, the death of his son Kingsley just before the end of the First World War, and the deaths of his brother Innes, his two brothers-in-law (one of whom was [[Ernest William Hornung|E. W. Hornung]], creator of the literary character [[A. J. Raffles|Raffles]]) and his two nephews shortly after the war, Doyle sank into depression. He found solace supporting [[spiritualism]] and its attempts to find proof of [[Afterlife|existence beyond the grave]]. In particular, according to some,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Did Conan Doyle Go Too Far? |journal=Psychic News|first=Leslie|last=Price|issue=4037|year=2010}}</ref> he favoured [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|Christian Spiritualism]] and encouraged the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] to accept an eighth precept – that of following the teachings and example of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. He was a member of the renowned supernatural organisation [[The Ghost Club]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Topham|url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/the-ghost-club-a-history-by-peter-underwood.html|title=The Ghost Club – A History by Peter Underwood|publisher=Mysteriousbritain.co.uk|date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=28 May 2013}}</ref>

On 28 October 1918, Kingsley Doyle died from pneumonia, which he contracted during his convalescence after being seriously wounded during the 1916 [[Battle of the Somme]]. Brigadier-General Innes Doyle died, also from pneumonia, in February 1919. Sir Arthur became involved with Spiritualism to the extent that he wrote a novella on the subject, ''[[The Land of Mist]]'', featuring the character Professor Challenger. ''The Coming of the Fairies'' (1922)<ref>{{cite web|title=The Coming of the Fairies|url=http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=detailsTab&ct=display&fn=search&doc=BLL01015503689&indx=1&recIds=BLL01015503689&recIdxs=0&elementId=&renderMode=poppedOut&displayMode=full&dscnt=1&fctN=facet_creator&vl(174399379UI0)=any&frbrVersion=4&scp.scps=scope%3A(BLCONTENT)&fctV=Doyle%2C%2BArthur%2BConan%2C%2BSir%2C%2B1859-1930&tab=local_tab&dstmp=1371045422461&srt=rank&mode=Basic&gathStatTab=true&tb=t&vl(freeText0)=The%2BComing%2Bof%2Bthe%2BFairies&vid=BLVU1&frbg=&dum=true|work=British Library catalogue|publisher=[[British Library]]|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref> appears to show that Conan Doyle was convinced of the veracity of the five [[Cottingley Fairies]] photographs (which decades later were exposed as a hoax). He reproduced them in the book, together with theories about the nature and existence of fairies and spirits.

In 1919, the magician [[P. T. Selbit]] staged a séance at his own flat in [[Bloomsbury]]. Doyle attended the séance and declared the [[clairvoyance]] manifestations to be genuine.<ref>Baker, Robert A. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. p. 234. ISBN 978-1-57392-094-0</ref><ref>Christopher, Milbourne. (1996). ''The Illustrated History of Magic''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 264. ISBN 978-0-435-07016-8</ref> In 1920, Doyle debated the claims of [[Spiritualism]] with the notable sceptic [[Joseph McCabe]] at Queen's Hall in London. McCabe later published his evidence against the claims of Doyle and Spiritualism in a booklet entitled ''Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?'' which claimed Doyle had been duped into believing Spiritualism by [[mediumship]] trickery.<ref>[[Joseph McCabe]]. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/isspiritualismba00mccarich#page/n3/mode/2up ''Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined'']. London Watts & Co.</ref>

Doyle was friends for a time with [[Harry Houdini]], the American magician who himself became a prominent opponent of the Spiritualist movement in the 1920s following the death of his beloved mother. Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery (and consistently exposed them as frauds), Doyle became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers—a view expressed in Doyle's ''The Edge of the Unknown''. Houdini was apparently unable to convince Doyle that his feats were simply illusions, leading to a bitter public falling out between the two.<ref>[[Massimo Polidoro]]. (2003). ''Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims''. Prometheus Books. pp. 120-124. ISBN 1-59102-086-7</ref>  A specific incident is recounted in memoirs by Houdini's friend Bernard M.L. Ernst, in which Houdini performed an impressive trick at his home in the presence of Conan Doyle. Houdini assured Conan Doyle the trick was pure illusion and that he was attempting to prove a point about Doyle not "endorsing phenomena" simply because he had no explanation.  According to Ernst, Conan Doyle refused to believe it was a trick.<ref>Polidoro, Massimo.  "Houdini's Impossible Demonstration."  ''Skeptical Inquirer.''  The Committee For Skeptical Inquiry.  http://www.csicop.org/SI/show/houdinirsquos_impossible_demonstration/  (August 2006).</ref>

In 1922, the psychical researcher [[Harry Price]] accused the spirit photographer [[William Hope (paranormal investigator)|William Hope]] of fraud. Doyle defended Hope, but further evidence of trickery was obtained from other researchers.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Massimo Polidoro]] |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/photos_of_ghosts_the_burden_of_believing_the_unbelievable |title=Photos of Ghosts: The Burden of Believing the Unbelievable by Massimo Polidoro |publisher=Csicop.org |date= 2011|accessdate=5 December 2013}}</ref> Doyle threatened to have Price evicted from the [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]] and claimed if he persisted to write "sewage" about spiritualists, he would meet the same fate as Harry Houdini.<ref>William Kalush, Larry Ratso Sloman.

''Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle''. Prometheus Books. p. 67. ISBN 978-1-57392-896-0</ref> Because of the exposure of Hope and other fraudulent spiritualists, Doyle led a mass resignation of eighty-four members of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], as they believed the Society was opposed to spiritualism.<ref>G. K. Nelson. (2013). ''Spiritualism and Society''. Routledge. p. 159; ISBN 978-0-415-71462-4</ref>

Doyle and spiritualist [[William Thomas Stead]] were duped into believing [[Julius and Agnes Zancig]] had genuine psychic powers, both claiming that the Zancigs used [[telepathy]]. In 1924 Julius and Agnes Zancig confessed that that their [[Mentalism|mind reading]] act was a trick and published the secret code and all the details of the trick method they had used, under the title ''Our Secrets!!'' in a London newspaper.<ref>[[John Booth (magician)|John Booth]]. (1986). ''Psychic Paradoxes''. Prometheus Books. p. 8; ISBN 978-0-87975-358-0</ref> In his book ''The History of Spiritualism'' (1926), Doyle praised the [[psychic]] phenomena and spirit [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]]s produced by [[Eusapia Palladino]] and [[Mina Crandon]], who were both exposed as frauds.<ref name= Houdini>William Kalush, Larry Ratso Sloman. (2006). ''The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero''. Atria Books.

[[Richard Milner (historian)|Richard Milner]], an American historian of science, has presented a case that Doyle may have been the perpetrator of the [[Piltdown Man]] hoax of 1912, creating the counterfeit [[hominidae|hominid]] [[fossil]] that fooled the scientific world for over 40 years.

==Death==
[[File:Doyle Arthur Conan grave.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Doyle's grave at [[Minstead]], England]]
Doyle was found clutching his chest in the hall of Windlesham Manor, his house in [[Crowborough]], East Sussex, on 7 July 1930. He died of a heart attack at the age of 71. His last words were directed toward his wife: "You are wonderful."<ref>Stashower, p. 439.</ref> At the time of his death, there was some controversy concerning his burial place, as he was avowedly not a Christian, considering himself a [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]]. He was first buried on 11 July 1930 in Windlesham rose garden.

He was later reinterred together with his wife in [[Minstead]] churchyard in the [[New Forest]], Hampshire.<ref Name="NDB"/> Carved wooden tablets to his memory and to the memory of his wife, originally from the church at Minstead, are on display as part of a Sherlock Holmes exhibition at Portsmouth Museum.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-wooden-headstone-of-sir-arthur-conan-doyle-at-a-special-display--33668994.html?pv=1&stamp=2&imageid=BD2C7240-7D76-4D4E-9632-6F01BA8962F7&p=3609&n=1&orientation=0&pn=1&searchtype=0&IsFromSearch=1&srch=foo%253dbar%2526st%253d0%2526sortby%253d2%2526qt%253dsir%252520arthur%252520conan%252520doyle%252520portsmouth%252520museum%2526qt_raw%253dsir%252520arthur%252520conan%252520doyle%252520portsmouth%252520museum%2526qn%253d%2526lic%253d3%2526mr%253d0%2526pr%253d0%2526aoa%253d1%2526creative%253d%2526videos%253d%2526nu%253d%2526ccc%253d%2526bespoke%253d%2526apalib%253d%2526ag%253d0%2526hc%253d0%2526et%253d0x000000000000000000000%2526vp%253d0%2526loc%253d0%2526ot%253d0%2526imgt%253d0%2526dtfr%253d%2526dtto%253d%2526size%253d0xFF%2526blackwhite%253d%2526cutout%253d%2526archive%253d1%2526name%253d%2526groupid%253d%2526pseudoid%253d%2526userid%253d%2526id%253d%2526a%253d%2526xstx%253d0%2526cbstore%253d1%2526lightbox%253d%2526resultview%253dsortbyPopular%2526gname%253d%2526gtype%253d%2526apalic%253d%2526tbar%253d1%2526pc%253d%2526simid%253d%2526cap%253d1%2526customgeoip%253d%2526vd%253d0%2526cid%253d%2526saveQry%253d%2526editorial%253d1%2526t%253d0%2526edoptin%253d|title=Stock Photo - Wooden headstone of Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle at a special display in the Town's museum.
