It is the [[county seat|seat]] of [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], the most populous county in the state. Detroit's [[metropolitan area]], known as [[Metro Detroit]], is home to 4.3 million people, making it the [[List of Metropolitan Statistical Areas|fourteenth-most populous]] metropolitan area in the United States and the second-largest in the [[Midwestern United States]] (behind [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]]).

The [[Detroit–Windsor]] area, a commercial link straddling the [[Canada–United States border|Canada–U.S. border]], has a total population of about 5.7 million.<ref name=Agglomerations>[http://www.citypopulation.de/World.html World Agglomerations] Retrieved on May 5, 2009.</ref> The Detroit metropolitan region holds roughly one-half of Michigan's population.<ref name=CensusCity/><ref name=CensusMSA/> Detroit is a major port on the [[Detroit River]], a [[strait]] that connects the [[Great Lakes]] system to the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]. The [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]] is among the most important [[Airline hub|hubs]] in the United States. The City of Detroit anchors the second-largest economic region in the [[Midwest]], behind [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicago]], and the [[List of U.S. metropolitan areas by GDP|thirteenth-largest]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/gdp_metro/gdp_metro_newsrelease.htm|title=BEA: News Release: GDP by Metropolitan Area, Advance 2014, and Revised 2001–2013|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ECONOMIC GROWTH WIDESPREAD ACROSS METROPOLITAN AREAS IN 2014|website=Bureau of Economic Analysis|publisher=United States Department of Commerce|accessdate=25 September 2015}}</ref>

Detroit was founded on July 24, 1701 by the French explorer and adventurer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] and a party of settlers. With expansion of the automobile industry, the Detroit area emerged as a significant metropolitan region within the United States in the early 20th century, when the city became the fourth-largest in the country for a period. In the 1950s and 1960s, expansion continued with construction of a regional [[Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit|freeway system]].

Due to industrial restructuring and loss of jobs in the auto industry, Detroit lost considerable population from the late 20th century to present. Between 2000 and 2010 the city's population fell by 25 percent, changing its ranking from the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#2000|nation's 10th-largest city]] to 18th.<ref name=Wisely/> In 2010, the city had a population of 713,777, more than a 60 percent drop from a peak population of over 1.8 million at the 1950 census. This resulted from suburbanization, industrial restructuring, and the [[decline of Detroit]]'s auto industry.<ref name=CensusCity>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=26:2622000|accessdate=March 3, 2012|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> Following the shift of population and jobs to its suburbs or other states or nations, the city has focused on becoming the metropolitan region's employment and economic center.

The erstwhile rapid growth of the city left a globally unique stock of [[Architecture of metropolitan Detroit|architectural monuments]] and [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Detroit, Michigan|historic places]] of the first half of the 20th century, with many of them falling into disrepair or torn down since the 1960s. [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|Conservation]] efforts managed to save many architectural pieces since the 2000s and allowed several large-scale revitalisations. [[Downtown Detroit]] has held an increased role as a cultural destination in the 21st century, with the restoration of several historic theatres and entertainment venues, new sports stadiums, and a riverfront revitalization project. More recently, the population of Downtown Detroit, [[Midtown Detroit]], and a handful of other neighborhoods has increased. Some other neighborhoods remain distressed, with extensive abandonment of properties.

The Governor of Michigan, [[Rick Snyder]], declared a [[Financial emergency in Michigan|financial emergency]] for the city in March 2013, appointing an emergency manager. On July 18, 2013, [[Detroit bankruptcy|Detroit filed the largest municipal bankruptcy case]] in U.S. history.<ref name="detroitnews1">{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130718/METRO01/307180103#ixzz2ZQqjpHYO |title=The Detroit News |publisher= |accessdate=October 31, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20131013182100/http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20130718/METRO01/307180103 |archivedate=13 October 2013 }}</ref> It was declared bankrupt by Judge Steven W.

The present church was completed in 1887.<ref name=Woodford/>]]
The city was named by [[New France|French colonists]], referring to the [[Detroit River]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|le détroit du lac Érié}}, meaning ''the [[strait]] of Lake Erie''), linking [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Erie]]; in the historical context, the strait included the [[St. Clair River]], [[Lake St. Clair]] and the Detroit River.<ref name="RivièreduDétroit">{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/french/exhibits/franco_ontarian/big/big_36_map_detroit_river.htm |title=La rivière du Détroit depuis le lac Érié, 1764 |accessdate=May 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080703220808/http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/french/exhibits/franco_ontarian/big/big_36_map_detroit_river.htm |archivedate=July 3, 2008 }}</ref><ref>[[List of U.S. place names of French origin]]</ref>

On the shores of the strait, in 1701, the French officer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]], along with fifty-one French people and [[French Canadians]], founded a settlement called [[Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit]], naming it after [[Louis Phélypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain]], Minister of Marine under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]].<ref name=Riley>{{Cite book| author=Riley, John L.|title=The Once and Future Great Lakes Country: An Ecological History|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press| year=2013|isbn=0-7735-4177-2}}, p. 56.</ref> France offered free land to colonists to attract families to Detroit; when it reached a total population of 800 in 1765, it was the largest city between [[Montreal]] and [[New Orleans]], both also French settlements.<ref>[http://www.archives.gov.on.ca/ENGLISH/exhibits/franco_ontarian/detroit.htm French Ontario in the 17th and 18th centuries – Detroit].

By 1778, its population was up to 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in the [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|Province of Quebec]].<ref>Jacqueline Peterson, Jennifer S. H. Brown, ''Many Roads to Red River'' (2001), p69</ref>

The region grew based on the lucrative [[fur trade]], in which numerous Native American people had important roles. Detroit's city flag reflects its French colonial heritage. (See [[Flag of Detroit]]). Descendants of the earliest French and French Canadian settlers formed a cohesive community who gradually were replaced as the dominant population after more Anglo-American settlers came to the area in the early 19th century. Living along the shores of Lakes St. Clair, and south to Monroe and downriver suburbs, the French Canadians of Detroit, also known as [[Muskrat French]], remain a subculture in the region today.<ref>{{cite web|last1=LaForest|first1=James|title=‘Muskrat French’: French-Canadian River Culture in the Windsor/Detroit Region|url=https://voyageurheritage.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/muskrat-french-french-canadian-river-culture-in-the-windsordetroit-region/|website=Voyageur Heritage: Community Journal and Resource Guide|publisher=James LaForest|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Beneteau|first1=Marcel|title=Detroit River: A Special Place in French North American History|url=http://www.ameriquefrancaise.org/en/article-453/Detroit_River:_A_Special_Place_in_French_North_American_History.html|website=Encyclopedia of French Cultural Heritage in North America|publisher=Encylcopedia of French Cultural Heritage in North America|accessdate=5 September 2015}}</ref>

During the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–63), the North American front of the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France, British troops gained control of the settlement in 1760. They shortened the name to ''Detroit''. Several Native American tribes launched [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] (1763), and conducted a [[siege of Fort Detroit]], but failed to capture it. In defeat, France ceded its territory in North America east of the Mississippi to Britain following the war.

Following the [[American Revolutionary War]] and United States independence, Britain ceded Detroit along with other territory in the area under the [[Jay Treaty]] (1796), which established the northern border with Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Detroit-a-Chronicle-of-Its-Progress-Volume-1/105630/110 |title="History of Detroit: A Chronicle of Its Progress" Page 71, 1912 |publisher=Mocavo.com |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2014}}</ref> In 1805, fire destroyed most of the Detroit settlement, which consisted mostly of wooden buildings. A river warehouse and brick chimneys of the former wooden homes were the sole structures to survive.<ref>[http://www.ste-anne.org/dempsey.html "Ste. Anne of Detroit"], St. Anne Church. Retrieved on April 29, 2006.</ref>

===19th century===
From 1805 to 1847, Detroit was the capital of Michigan (first the territory, then the state). Detroit surrendered without a fight to British troops during the [[War of 1812]] in the [[Siege of Detroit]]. The [[Battle of Frenchtown]] (January 18–23, 1813) was part of a United States effort to retake the city, and American troops suffered their highest fatalities of any battle in the war. This battle is commemorated at [[River Raisin National Battlefield Park]] south of Detroit in Monroe County. Detroit was finally recaptured by the United States later that year.

It was incorporated as a city in 1815.<ref name=Woodford/> As the city expanded, a geometric street plan developed by [[Augustus B. Woodward]] was followed, featuring grand boulevards as in Paris.

Prior to the [[American Civil War]], the city's access to the Canadian border made it a key stop for refugee slaves gaining freedom in the North along the [[Underground Railroad]]. Many went across the Detroit River to Canada to escape pursuit by slave catchers.<ref name=Woodford/> There were estimated to be 20,000 to 30,000 African-American refugees who settled in Canada.

Numerous men from Detroit volunteered to fight for the Union during the [[American Civil War]], including the 24th Michigan Infantry Regiment (part of the legendary [[Iron Brigade]]), which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863. When the First Volunteer Infantry Regiment arrived to fortify Washington, DC, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] is quoted as saying "Thank God for Michigan!" [[George Armstrong Custer]] led the [[Michigan Brigade]] during the Civil War and called them the "Wolverines".<ref>Rosentreter, Roger (July/August 1998). "Come on you Wolverines, Michigan at Gettysburg," ''[[Michigan History magazine]]''.</ref>

During the late 19th century, several [[Gilded Age]] mansions reflecting the wealth of industry and shipping magnates were built east and west of the current downtown, along the major avenues of the Woodward plan. Most notable among them was the [[David Whitney House]] located at 4421 [[Woodward Avenue]], which became a prime location for mansions. During this period some referred to Detroit as the ''Paris of the West'' for its architecture, grand avenues in the Paris style, and for Washington Boulevard, recently electrified by [[Thomas Edison]].<ref name=Woodford/>  The city had grown steadily from the 1830s with the rise of shipping, shipbuilding, and manufacturing industries. Strategically located along the [[Great Lakes]] waterway, Detroit emerged as a major port and transportation hub.

In 1896, a thriving carriage trade prompted [[Henry Ford]] to build his first automobile in a rented workshop on Mack Avenue. During this growth period, Detroit expanded its borders by annexing all or part of several surrounding villages and townships.

===20th century===
[[File:Change of work shift at Ford Motor Company.jpg|thumb|A 4 [[12-hour clock|p.m.]] change of work shift at the Ford Motor Company assembly plant in [[Highland Park, Michigan]], 1910s]]

In 1903, Henry Ford founded the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Ford's manufacturing—and those of automotive pioneers [[William C. Durant]], the [[Dodge Brothers]], [[Packard]], and [[Walter Chrysler]]—established Detroit's status in the early 20th century as the world's automotive capital.<ref name=Woodford/> The growth of the auto industry was reflected by changes in businesses throughout the Midwest and nation, with the development of garages to service vehicles and gas stations, as well as factories for parts and tires.

With the rapid growth of industrial workers in the auto factories, [[labor unions]] such as the [[American Federation of Labor]] and the [[United Auto Workers]] fought to organize workers to gain them better working conditions and wages. They initiated [[Strike action|strikes]] and other tactics in support of improvements such as [[8-hour working day|the 8-hour day/40-hour work week]], increased [[wage]]s, greater benefits and improved [[Occupational safety and health|working conditions]]. The labor activism during those years increased influence of union leaders in the city such as [[Jimmy Hoffa]] of the [[Teamsters]] and [[Walter Reuther]] of the Autoworkers.

The city became the 4th-largest in the nation in 1920, after only New York City, Chicago and [[Philadelphia]], with the influence of the booming auto industry.

The [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol]] from 1920 to 1933 resulted in the Detroit River becoming a major conduit for smuggling of illegal Canadian spirits.<ref>Nolan, Jenny (June 15, 1999).[http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=181 How Prohibition made Detroit a bootlegger's dream town].

Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] beginning in 1915. "By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK," whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans.<ref name="43riots">[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eleanor-riots/ "Detroit Race Riots 1943"].

The [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic [[Works Progress Administration]] organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder.

Jobs expanded so rapidly that 400,000 people were attracted to the city from 1941 to 1943, including 50,000 blacks in the second wave of the Great Migration, and 350,000 whites, many of them from the South. Some European immigrants and their descendants feared black competition for jobs and housing. The federal government prohibited discrimination in defense work but when in June 1943, Packard promoted three blacks to work next to whites on its assembly lines, 25,000 whites walked off the job.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gP3DbiRcbPAC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=I%E2%80%99d+rather+see+Hitler+and+Hirohito+win+than+work+next+to+a+nigger&source=bl&ots=69xKZx1TNm&sig=cbsT6DR44pliovzPxIjoa_5oCeE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Kh2LUdnJJ_CB0QHY0IAo&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=I%E2%80%99d%20rather%20see%20Hitler%20and%20Hirohito%20win%20than%20work%20next%20to%20a%20nigger&f=false Philip A.

===Postwar era===
Industrial mergers in the 1950s, especially in the automobile sector, increased [[oligopoly]] in the American auto industry. Detroit manufacturers such as [[Packard Motor Car Company|Packard]] and [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] merged into other companies and eventually disappeared. At its peak population of 1,849,568, in the [[1950 United States Census|1950 Census]], the city was the 5th-largest in the United States, after New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.

[[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1950|As in other major American cities]] in the postwar era, construction of an extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated suburbanization; highways made commuting by car easier. In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used [[streetcar|electric streetcar line]] along the length of Woodward Avenue was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941 at peak times, a streetcar ran on [[Woodward Avenue]] every 60 seconds.<ref name="Peter Gavrilovich 2000 p.232">Peter Gavrilovich & Bill McGraw (2000) ''The Detroit Almanac: 300 Years of Life in the Motor City.'' p. 232</ref><ref>[http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9040 News+Views: Back track], ''Metro Times,'' Retrieved on July 16, 2013.</ref>

All of these changes in the area's transportation system favored low-density, auto-oriented development rather than high-density urban development, and industry also moved to the suburbs. The metro Detroit area developed as one of the most [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] job markets in the United States by the 21st century, and combined with poor public transport, resulted in many jobs beyond the reach of urban low-income workers.<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20130418/BUSINESS06/304180118/jobs-sprawl-Detroit-Brookings-Institution "Metro Detroit job sprawl worst in U.S.; many jobs beyond reach of poor"], ''Detroit Free Press''.

In 1950, the city held about one-third of the state's population, anchored by its industries and workers. Over the next sixty years, the city's population declined to less than 10 percent of the state's population. During the same time period, the sprawling Detroit metropolitan area, which surrounds and includes the city, grew to contain more than half of Michigan's population.<ref name=Woodford/> The shift of population and jobs eroded Detroit's tax base.

In June 1963, Rev. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] gave a [[Detroit Walk to Freedom|major speech]] in Detroit that foreshadowed his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech in Washington, D.C. two months later. While the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68)|African-American Civil Rights Movement]] gained significant federal civil rights laws in 1964 and 1965, longstanding inequities resulted in confrontations between the police and inner city black youth wanting change. Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the [[1967 Detroit riot|Twelfth Street riot]] in July 1967. Governor [[George W. Romney]] ordered the Michigan National Guard into Detroit, and President Johnson sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods. The affected district lay in ruins for decades.<ref>Sidney Fine, ''Violence in the Model City: The Cavanaugh Administration, Race Relations, and the Detroit Riot of 1967'' (1989)</ref> It was the most costly riot in the United States.

On August 18, 1970, the [[NAACP]] filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor [[William Milliken]], charging ''de facto'' public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain [[Racial segregation in the United States#Education|racial segregation]] in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods.<ref name=Meinke2011>{{cite journal|last=Meinke|first=Samantha|title=Milliken v Bradley: The Northern Battle for Desegregation|journal=Michigan Bar Journal|date=September 2011|volume=90|issue=9|pages=20–22|url=http://www.michbar.org/journal/pdf/pdf4article1911.pdf|accessdate=July 27, 2012}}</ref> The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth Circuit Court]] affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to [[Racial integration|integrate]] across the segregated metropolitan area.<ref name=Sedler87>{{cite journal|last=Sedler|first=Robert A.|title=The Profound Impact of Milliken v Bradley|journal=Wayne Law Review|year=1987|volume=33|issue=5|page=1693|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/waynlr33&g_sent=1&collection=journals&id=1707|accessdate=July 29, 2012}}</ref>
The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974.<ref name=Meinke2011 /> The subsequent [[Milliken v. Bradley|''Milliken v. Bradley'' decision]] had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.

"Milliken was perhaps the greatest missed opportunity of that period," said [[Myron Orfield]], professor of law at the [[University of Minnesota]]. "Had that gone the other way, it would have opened the door to fixing nearly all of Detroit's current problems."<ref name="remapp">[http://www.remappingdebate.org/article/squandered-opportunities-leave-detroit-isolated?page=0,2 "Squandered opportunities leave Detroit isolated"], Remapping Debate website.

John Mogk, a professor of law and an expert in urban planning at [[Wayne State University]] in Detroit, says, "Everybody thinks that it was the riots [in 1967] that caused the white families to leave. Some people were leaving at that time but, really, it was after Milliken that you saw mass flight to the suburbs. If the case had gone the other way, it is likely that Detroit would not have experienced the steep decline in its tax base that has occurred since then."<ref name="remapp"/>

In November 1973, the city elected [[Coleman Young]] as its first black mayor. After taking office, Young emphasized increasing racial diversity in the police department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Detroit Police Department|url=http://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/detroit-police-department|website=Detroit Historical Society|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref>
Young also worked to improve Detroit's transportation system, but tension between Young and his suburban counterparts over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term. In 1976, the federal government offered $600 million for building a regional [[rapid transit]] system, under a single regional authority.<ref>{{cite web|title=How metro Detroit transit went from best to worst|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/02/06/michigan-detroit-public-transit/22926133/|publisher=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>  But the inability of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit. Following the failure to reach an agreement over the larger system, the City moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system, which became known as the [[Detroit People Mover]].<ref>{{cite news|title=How Detroit ended up with the worst public transit|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/how-detroit-ended-up-with-the-worst-public-transit/Content?oid=2143889|accessdate=April 21, 2015|publisher=Metro Times}}</ref>

The gasoline crises of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]] also affected Detroit and the U.S. auto industry. Buyers chose smaller, more fuel-efficient cars made by foreign makers as the price of gas rose. Efforts to revive the city were stymied by the struggles of the auto industry, as their sales and market share declined. Automakers laid off thousands of employees and closed plants in the city, further eroding the tax base. To counteract this, the city used [[eminent domain]] to build two large new auto assembly plants in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Poletown Becomes Just a Memory: GM Plant Opens, Replacing Old Detroit Neighborhood|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-09-18/business/fi-6228_1_gm-plant|publisher=LA Times | first=James|last=Risen|date=September 18, 1985}}</ref>

As mayor, Young sought to revive the city by seeking to increase investment in the city's declining downtown. The [[Renaissance Center]], a mixed-use office and retail complex, opened in 1977. This group of skyscrapers was an attempt to keep businesses in downtown.<ref name=Woodford/><ref name=partnership/><ref name=Bailey/>
Young also gave city support to other large developments to attract middle and upper-class residents back to the city. Despite the Renaissance Center and other projects, the downtown area continued to lose businesses to the suburbs. Major stores and hotels closed and many large office buildings went vacant. Young was criticized for being too focused on downtown development and not doing enough to lower the city's high crime rate and improve city services.

High unemployment was compounded by [[middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, and some residents leaving the state to find work. The city was left with a higher proportion of poor in its population, reduced tax base, depressed property values, abandoned buildings, abandoned neighborhoods, high crime rates and a pronounced demographic imbalance.

In 1993 Young retired as Detroit's longest serving mayor, deciding not to seek a sixth term. That year the city elected [[Dennis Archer]], a former Michigan Supreme Court justice. Archer prioritized downtown development and easing tensions with Detroit's suburban neighbors. A referendum to allow casino gambling in the city passed in 1996; several temporary casino facilities opened in 1999, and permanent downtown casinos with hotels opened in 2007–08.<ref>{{cite web|title=East Riverfront History|url=http://www.degc.org/businesses/east-riverfront-history-1|publisher=Detroit Economic Growth Corporation|accessdate=April 21, 2015}}</ref>

Seen in panorama, Detroit's waterfront shows a variety of architectural styles. The [[Post-modern architecture|post modern]] Neo-Gothic spires of the [[One Detroit Center]] (1993) were designed to blend with the city's [[Art Deco]] skyscrapers. Together with the [[Renaissance Center]], they form a distinctive and recognizable skyline. Examples of the [[Art Deco]] style include the [[Guardian Building]] and [[Penobscot Building]] downtown, as well as the [[Fisher Building]] and [[Cadillac Place]] in the [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] area near [[Wayne State University]]. Among the city's prominent structures are United States' largest [[Fox Theatre (Detroit)|Fox Theatre]], the [[Detroit Opera House]], and the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].<ref name=AIADetroit>{{Cite book |author1=Hill, Eric J.  |author2=John Gallagher | title= AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture| year=2002 | publisher=Wayne State University Press }}</ref><ref name=DetArch>{{Cite book | author=[[Robert Sharoff|Sharoff, Robert]] | title=American City: Detroit Architecture| publisher=Wayne State University Press| year=2005| isbn=0-8143-3270-6}}</ref>

While the [[Downtown Detroit|Downtown]] and New Center areas contain high-rise buildings, the majority of the surrounding city consists of low-rise structures and single-family homes. Outside of the city's core, residential high-rises are found in upper-class neighborhoods such as the East Riverfront extending toward [[Grosse Pointe]] and the [[Palmer Park Apartment Building Historic District|Palmer Park]] neighborhood just west of Woodward. The University Commons-Palmer Park district in northwest Detroit, near the [[University of Detroit Mercy]] and [[Marygrove College]], anchors historic neighborhoods including [[Palmer Woods]], [[Sherwood Forest, Detroit|Sherwood Forest]], and the [[University District, Detroit|University District]].

The [[List of Registered Historic Places in Detroit, Michigan|National Register of Historic Places]] lists several area neighborhoods and districts. Neighborhoods constructed prior to World War II feature the architecture of the times, with wood-frame and brick houses in the working-class neighborhoods, larger brick homes in middle-class neighborhoods, and ornate mansions in upper-class neighborhoods such as [[Brush Park]], [[Woodbridge, Detroit|Woodbridge]], [[Indian Village, Detroit|Indian Village]], [[Palmer Woods]], [[Boston-Edison Historic District|Boston-Edison]], and others.

Some of the oldest neighborhoods are along the Woodward and [[East Jefferson Avenue Residential TR|East Jefferson]] corridors. Some newer residential construction may also be found along the Woodward corridor, the far west, and northeast. Some of the oldest extant neighborhoods include [[West Canfield Historic District|West Canfield]] and [[Brush Park]], which have both seen multimillion-dollar restorations and construction of new homes and condominiums.<ref name=partnership>{{Wayback |date=20080613121052 |url=http://www.theworldiscoming.com/seethechange.html |title=The world is coming, see the change }}.

The [[Detroit International Riverfront]] includes a partially completed three-and-one-half mile riverfront promenade with a combination of parks, residential buildings, and commercial areas. It extends from [[Hart Plaza]] to the MacArthur Bridge accessing [[Belle Isle Park]] (the largest island park in a U.S. city). The riverfront includes [[Tri-Centennial State Park]] and Harbor, Michigan's first urban state park. The second phase is a two-mile (3&nbsp;km) extension from Hart Plaza to the [[Ambassador Bridge]] for a total of five miles (8&nbsp;km) of parkway from bridge to bridge. Civic planners envision that the pedestrian parks will stimulate residential redevelopment of riverfront properties condemned under [[eminent domain]].

Other major parks include [[River Rouge Park|River Rouge]] (in the southwest side), the largest park in Detroit; Palmer (north of [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]]) and [[Chene Park]] (on the east river downtown).<ref>Editorial: "At Last, Sensible Dream for Detroit's Riverfront", ''Detroit News,'' December 13, 2002</ref>

The city of Detroit has a rich musical heritage and has contributed to a number of different genres over the decades leading into the new millennium.<ref name=Almanac2/> Important music events in the city include: the [[Detroit International Jazz Festival]], the [[Detroit Electronic Music Festival]], the Motor City Music Conference (MC2), the Urban Organic Music Conference, the [[Concert of Colors]], and the hip-hop Summer Jamz festival.<ref name=Almanac2/>

In the 1940s, [[Detroit blues]] artist [[John Lee Hooker]] became a long-term resident in the city's southwest Delray neighborhood. Hooker, among other important [[blues]] musicians migrated from his home in [[Mississippi]] bringing the [[Delta blues]] to northern cities like Detroit. Hooker recorded for [[Fortune Records]], the biggest pre-Motown blues/soul label. During the 1950s, the city became a center for jazz, with stars performing in the [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] neighborhood.<ref name=Woodford/> Prominent emerging [[Jazz]] musicians of the 1960s included: trumpet player [[Donald Byrd]] who attended Cass Tech and performed with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers early in his career and Saxophonist [[Pepper Adams]] who enjoyed a solo career and accompanied Byrd on several albums. The Graystone International Jazz Museum documents [[jazz]] in Detroit.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Graystone Online|url=http://www.ipl.org.ar/exhibit/detjazz/Graystone.html|publisher=Internet Public Library of the University of Michigan|accessdate=May 5, 2009}}</ref>

Other, prominent Motor City R&B stars in the 1950s and early 1960s was [[Nolan Strong]], [[Andre Williams]] and [[Nathaniel Mayer]] – who all scored local and national hits on the Fortune Records label. According to Smokey Robinson, Strong was a primary influence on his voice as a teenager. The Fortune label was a family-operated label located on Third Avenue in Detroit, and was owned by the husband and wife team of Jack Brown and Devora Brown. Fortune, which also released country, gospel and rockabilly LPs and 45s, laid the groundwork for Motown, which became Detroit's most legendary record label.<ref name=Carson>{{Cite book |first= David A. |last= Carson |title= Noise, and Revolution: The Birth of Detroit Rock 'n' Roll |publisher= University of Michigan Press |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-472-11503-0 }}</ref>

[[Berry Gordy, Jr.]] founded [[Motown Records]] which rose to prominence during the 1960s and early 1970s with acts such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The Temptations]], [[The Four Tops]], [[Smokey Robinson & The Miracles]], [[Diana Ross & The Supremes]], the [[The Jackson 5|Jackson 5]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]], [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]], [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[The Elgins]], [[The Monitors (American band)|The Monitors]], [[The Velvelettes]] and [[Marvin Gaye]].

[[The Motown Sound]] played an important role in the crossover appeal with popular music, since it was the first African American owned record label to primarily feature African-American artists. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972 to pursue film production, but the company has since returned to Detroit. [[Aretha Franklin]], another Detroit R&B star, carried the Motown Sound; however, she did not record with Berry's Motown Label.<ref name=Almanac2/>

Local artists and bands rose to prominence in the 1960s and 70s including: the [[MC5]], [[The Stooges]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Amboy Dukes]] featuring [[Ted Nugent]], [[Mitch Ryder]] and The Detroit Wheels, [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]], [[Alice Cooper]], and [[Suzi Quatro]]. The group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] emphasized the city's connection with rock in the song ''[[Detroit Rock City]]'' and the movie produced in 1999. In the 1980s, Detroit was an important center of the [[hardcore punk rock]] underground with many nationally known bands coming out of the city and its suburbs, such as [[The Necros]], [[The Meatmen]], and [[Negative Approach]].<ref name="Carson" />

Detroit is one of 12 American metropolitan areas that are home to professional teams representing the four major sports in North America. All these teams but one play within the city of Detroit itself (the [[National Basketball Association|NBA's]] [[Detroit Pistons]] play in suburban [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] at [[The Palace of Auburn Hills]]).

"This  allows Canada and Michigan to move the project forward immediately to its next steps which include further design work and property acquisition on the U.S. side of the border," Raitt said in a statement issued after she spoke in the House of Commons.

[[File:DPMoverRenCenstop.jpg|thumb|People Mover train comes into the [[Renaissance Center]] station]]
[[Mass transit]] in the region is provided by bus services. The [[Detroit Department of Transportation]] (DDOT) provides service to the outer edges of the city. From there, the [[Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation|Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART)]] provides service to the suburbs. Cross border service between the downtown areas of Windsor and Detroit is provided by [[Transit Windsor]] via the Tunnel Bus.<ref name=Tunnelbus>{{cite web|url=http://www.citywindsor.ca/000600.asp |title=Routes and Schedules |accessdate=May 5, 2009 |author=Transit Windsor. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20070927205706/http://www.citywindsor.ca/000600.asp |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>

An elevated rail system known as the [[Detroit People Mover|People Mover]], completed in 1987, provides daily service around a {{convert|2.94|mi|km}} loop downtown. The under construction (to open in 2016) [[M-1 Rail Line]] (see below) will serve as a link between the [[Detroit People Mover]] and [[SEMCOG Commuter Rail]]/[[Detroit (Amtrak station)|Detroit Amtrak station]]. The SEMCOG Commuter Rail line will extend from Detroit's [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] area to [[The Henry Ford]], [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Detroit Metropolitan Airport]], [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]], and [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] when it is opened.<ref name=SEMCOGrail>[http://www.semcog.org/AADD.aspx Ann Arbor – Detroit Regional Rail Project] ''SEMCOG''. Retrieved on February 4, 2010.</ref>

The [[Regional Transit Authority of Southeast Michigan|Regional Transit Authority (RTA)]] was established by an act of the Michigan legislature in December 2012 to oversee and coordinate all existing regional mass transit operations, and to develop new transit services in the region. The [[M-1 Rail Line]] is expected to open in mid-2017, running along [[Woodward Avenue]] from [[Downtown Detroit|downtown]] to the [[New Center, Detroit|New Center]] area.<ref>{{cite news  |date= July 28, 2014 |title= Construction Starts on Detroit Rail |work= [[The Mining Journal]] |location= Marquette, Michigan |agency= [[Associated Press]] |page= 5A}}</ref>

===Freeways===
{{Main|Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit}}

Metro Detroit has an extensive toll-free network of [[freeway]]s administered by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]]. Four major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]] surround the city. Detroit is connected via [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate&nbsp;75]] (I-75) and [[Interstate 96|I-96]] to [[Ontario Highway 401|Kings Highway 401]] and to major [[Southern Ontario]] cities such as [[London, Ontario]] and the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. I-75 (Chrysler and Fisher freeways) is the region's main north–south route, serving [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Detroit–Toledo and Seaway Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of Lake Erie.<ref name="Cantor">{{Cite book |last= Cantor |first= George |title= Detroit: An Insiders Guide to Michigan |year= 2005 |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn=0-472-03092-2}}</ref>

[[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] (Edsel Ford Freeway) runs east–west through Detroit and serves Ann Arbor to the west (where it continues to Chicago) and Port Huron to the northeast. The stretch of the current I-94 freeway from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one of America's earlier limited-access highways. [[Henry Ford]] built it to link the factories at Willow Run and Dearborn during World War II. A portion was known as the Willow Run Expressway. The [[Interstate 96 in Michigan|I-96]] freeway runs northwest–southeast through Livingston, Oakland and Wayne counties and (as the Jeffries Freeway through Wayne County) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.<ref name="Cantor"/>

[[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]] runs north–south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and [[Interstate 696|I-696]] in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit. [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] is a short spur route in downtown Detroit, an extension of the Chrysler Freeway. I-696 (Reuther Freeway) runs east–west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit. Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit. Michigan state highways designated with the letter M serve to connect major freeways.<ref name="Cantor"/>
