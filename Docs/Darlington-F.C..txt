'''Darlington Football Club''' was an English [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Darlington]], [[County Durham]]. The club was founded in 1883, and played its games at [[Feethams]], before moving to the [[The Darlington Arena|Darlington Arena]] in 2003. The arena is an [[all-seater stadium]] with a capacity of 25,000, although this was restricted to 10,000. The cost of the stadium was a major factor in driving the club into [[Administration (British football)|administration]]. The club originally played in regionally organised leagues, and were one of the founding members of the [[Northern Football League (England)|Northern League]] in 1889. They were first admitted to [[the Football League]] when the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] was formed in 1921.

They won the Third Division North title in 1925, and their 15th place in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1926 remained their highest ever league finish. After their admission to the League, they spent most of their history in the bottom tier. They won the [[Football League Third Division North Cup|Third Division North Cup]] in 1934; their first victory in nationally organised cup competition. They reached the last 16 of the [[FA Cup]] twice, and the quarter-final of the [[Football League Cup]] once, in 1968. In the early 1990s they won successive titles, with the Conference National in 1990 and the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1991. In 2011 they won the [[2011 FA Trophy Final|FA Trophy]], defeating [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] 1–0 at [[Wembley Stadium]].

In May 2012, the club was bought out of a period of administration without entering into a [[Trading while insolvent#Company voluntary agreement|Creditors Voluntary Agreement]] (CVA). [[The Football Association]] ruled that it should be treated as a new club, which required a change of playing name. The name chosen was [[Darlington 1883]], and that team was placed in the [[Northern Football League|Northern League]] Division One, which is the ninth tier of English football, for the 2012–13 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18535793 |title=Darlington fail in appeal to overturn FA demotion |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 June 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=rename>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18582393 |title=Darlington 1883 replaces former club name after FA ruling |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 June 2012 |accessdate=30 June 2012}}</ref><!--

The club's main rivals were [[Hartlepool United F.C.|Hartlepool United]]. The club's traditional colours were black and white shirts, black shorts and black and white socks. The club's crest depicted [[Locomotion No 1]], referencing the town's railway history, as well as a stylised [[Quakers|Quaker]] hat and the club's nickname, The Quakers, referencing the religious movement that had a historic influence on the town.

==History==

===Founding and pre-war===
In July 1883, a meeting was called in Darlington Grammar School to address concerns that so few [[Darlington]]-based football clubs were entering the major competition in the region, the [[Durham Challenge Cup]]. The meeting agreed with the view expressed by the ''[[Darlington & Stockton Times]]'' newspaper, that there was "no club, urban or rural, sufficiently powerful to worthily represent Darlington", decided to form a new club, and elected one Charles Samuel Craven, a local engineer, as secretary. Darlington Football Club duly entered the Durham Challenge Cup, reached the final in their first season, and won the trophy in 1885.<ref name="Echo Memories">{{cite news

In 1888, Darlington's kit consisted of a shirt with black and white vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks. Apart from a period between the 1910s and 1936, when blue shorts were worn, the basic colours of the home kit have remained black and white. The shirt design has varied, from the 1888 vertical stripes, through hoops, plain white, and back to hoops again in the 1990s.<ref name=hkitsdarlo>{{cite web

The club badge is in the form of a shield, divided diagonally into two parts; the smaller section, to the upper right, is in the club's home colour of white, the larger is red, their traditional away colour. In the white section is a stylised Quaker hat, emblematic of the major role played by the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers) in the history of the town. The larger section depicts [[George Stephenson]]'s [[Locomotion No 1]], the [[steam locomotive]] that hauled the first train on the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, ''The Quakers'', and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://behindthefootballbadges.com/DARLINGTON.php |title=Darlington |website=behindthefootballbadges.com |publisher=Paul Wild |accessdate=21 January 2010}}{{cbignore}}{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref>

[[Feethams]] was originally used by Darlington Cricket Club, but began to be used for football in the 1860s. Darlington F.C. began playing there when they formed in 1883. With growing crowd figures, the ground was expanded with the construction of the West stand at the turn of the twentieth century, and the construction of the Polam Lane end in 1905. In 1913, a pair of towers were built at the entrance to the ground, and in 1920, offices and changing rooms were built underneath the East stand. [[Floodlights (sport)|Floodlights]] were installed in September 1960, but after their first use an electrical fault gutted the West stand in a fire, prompting its rebuilding. In 1997, the East stand was demolished and rebuilt as an all seater stand.<ref name=feethams /> The new stand brought the capacity of the stadium up to 8,000.<ref name=feet2>{{cite web
