'''American Samoa''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-American Samoa.ogg|ə|ˈ|m|ɛr|ɨ|k|ən|_|s|ə|ˈ|m|oʊ|.|ə}}; {{lang-sm|Amerika Sāmoa'', {{IPA-all|aˈmɛɾika ˈsaːmʊa|}}; also ''Amelika Sāmoa'' or ''Sāmoa Amelika}}) is an [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territory]] of the [[United States]] located in the South [[Pacific Ocean]], southeast of [[Samoa]].<ref name=CIAfactbook/>

American Samoa consists of five main islands and two coral [[atoll]]s. The largest and most populous island is [[Tutuila]], with the [[Manu'a|Manu{{okina}}a]] Islands, [[Rose Atoll]], and [[Swains Island]] also included in the territory. American Samoa is part of the [[Samoan Islands]] chain, located west of the [[Cook Islands]], north of [[Tonga]], and some 300 miles (500&nbsp;km) south of [[Tokelau]]. To the west are the islands of the [[Wallis and Futuna]] group.

The [[United States Census Bureau|2010 census]] showed a total population of 55,519 people.<ref>[http://www.census.gov/2010census/news/releases/operations/cb11-cn177.html Census.gov] 2010 Census summary. Retrieved March 24, 2014</ref> The total land area is {{convert|199|sqkm|1|sp=us}}, slightly more than [[Washington, D.C.]] American Samoa is the southernmost territory of the U.S. and one of two U.S. territories (with the uninhabited [[Jarvis Island]]) south of the Equator. Tuna products are the main exports, and the main trading partner is the United States.

During the [[1918 flu pandemic]], the 12th governor of American Samoa [[John Martin Poyer]] quarantined the territory. Because of his actions, American Samoa was one of the few places in the world where no flu-related deaths occurred.

American Samoa is noted for having the highest rate of military enlistment of any U.S. state or territory. As of September 9, 2014, the local U.S. Army Recruiting Station in [[Pago Pago]] was ranked first in production out of the 885 Army recruiting stations and centers under the [[United States Army Recruiting Command]] (USAREC), which includes the 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, Korea, Japan, and Europe.<ref>http://www.samoanews.com/content/en/local-us-army-recruiting-station-ranked-1-world</ref>

Most American Samoans are bilingual and can speak [[American English|English]] and [[Samoan language|Samoan]] fluently. Samoan is the same language spoken in neighboring,  independent [[Samoa]].

==History==
[[File:Samoa islands 2002.gif|thumb|400px|Samoa Islands]]
{{main|History of Samoa|History of American Samoa}}

===18th century: First Western contact===
Contact with Europeans began in the early 18th century. [[Jacob Roggeveen]], a Dutchman, was the first known European to sight the [[Samoan Islands]] in 1722. This visit was followed by the French explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]], who named them the ''Navigator Islands'' in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when English [[missionaries]] and traders began arriving.

Early Western contact included a battle in the eighteenth century between French explorers and islanders in Tutuila, for which the Samoans were blamed in the [[Western civilization|West]], giving them a reputation for ferocity. The site of this battle is called [[Massacre Bay]].

===19th century===
Mission work in the Samoas had begun in late 1830 when [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] of the [[London Missionary Society]] arrived from the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tahiti]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Watson |first=R.M. |title=History of Samoa: THE ADVENT OF THE MISSIONARY.

Nevertheless, by the late nineteenth century, French, British, German, and American vessels routinely stopped at Samoa, as they valued [[Pago Pago|Pago Pago Harbor]] as a refueling station for coal-fired shipping and whaling.

[[File:Samoa Cram Map 1896.jpg|thumb|left|1896 map of the Samoa Islands.]]
In March 1889, a [[Germany|German]] naval force invaded a village on Samoa, and by doing so destroyed some American property. Three American warships then entered the [[Apia]] harbor and prepared to engage three German warships found there.<ref name=RLS>{{cite book |author=Stevenson, Robert Louis |title=[[A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa]]|year=1892|publisher=BiblioBazaar |isbn=1-4264-0754-8}}</ref> Before guns were fired, [[1889 Apia cyclone|a typhoon]] wrecked both the American and German ships. A compulsory [[armistice]] was called because of the lack of warships.<ref name=RLS/>

===Early 20th century===

[[File:German, British, American warships in Apia harbour, Samoa 1899.jpg|thumb|left|German, British and American warships in Apia Harbor, Samoa, 1899.]]

At the turn of the twentieth century, international rivalries in the latter half of the century were settled by the 1899 [[Tripartite Convention (1899)|Tripartite Convention]] in which Germany and the United States partitioned the [[Samoan Islands]] into two parts:<ref>Ryden, George Herbert. ''The Foreign Policy of the United States in Relation to Samoa''. New York: Octagon Books, 1975. (Reprint by special arrangement with Yale University Press. Originally published at New Haven: Yale University Press, 1928), p. 574; the Tripartite Convention (United States, Germany, Great Britain) was signed at Washington on December 2, 1899 with ratifications exchanged on February 16, 1900</ref> the eastern island group became a territory of the United States (the Tutuila Islands in 1900 and officially Manu'a in 1904) and is today known as American Samoa; the western islands, by far the greater landmass, became known as [[German Samoa]] after Britain vacated all claims to Samoa and accepted termination of German rights in [[Tonga]] and certain areas in the Solomon Islands and West Africa.<ref>Ryden, p. 571</ref> Forerunners to the Tripartite Convention of 1899 were the Washington Conference of 1887, the [[Treaty of Berlin (1889)|Treaty of Berlin of 1889]] and the Anglo-German Agreement on Samoa of 1899.

====US Protectorate====
[[File:BenjaminFranklinTilley.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rear Admiral|Rdml]]. [[Benjamin Franklin Tilley]], the [[List of governors of American Samoa|1st]] Governor of American Samoa (1900-1901)]]

The following year, the US formally occupied its portion: a smaller group of eastern islands, one of which surrounds the noted harbor of [[Pago Pago, American Samoa|Pago Pago]]. After the [[United States Navy]] took possession of eastern Samoa on behalf of the United States, the existing [[coaling station]] at Pago Pago Bay was expanded into a full naval station, known as [[United States Naval Station Tutuila]] under the command of a commandant. The Navy secured a [[Deed of Cession of Tutuila]] in 1900 and a [[Deed of Cession of Manuʻa]] in 1904 on behalf of the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]. The last sovereign of Manuʻa, the [[Tui Manua Elisala|Tui Manuʻa Elisala]], signed a Deed of Cession of Manuʻa following a series of U.S. Naval trials, known as the "Trial of the Ipu," in Pago Pago, Taʻu, and aboard a Pacific Squadron gunboat.<ref name = "ejgsbn">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nHp7-BTy57MC&pg=PA109&lpg=PA109&dq=passive+resistance+taulapapa&source=bl&ots=0Fi9UxdsVr&sig=IUcHLtCk5RdrWkUxuI8UpQG3raU&hl=en&ei=XHAVTKKuOaP38QahxJmSDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=passive%20resistance%20taulapapa&f=false |title=Passive Resistance of Samoans to US and Other Colonialisms, from Sovereignty Matters, University of Nebraska Press |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref> The territory became known as the US Naval Station Tutuila.

On July 17, 1911, the US Naval Station Tutuila, which was composed of Tutuila, Aunu'u and Manu'a, was officially renamed American Samoa.<ref name=tapuitea>{{cite news|first=Stan |last=Sorensen |title=Historical Notes, page 2 |url=http://americansamoa.gov/tapuitea/2006/Tapuitea60712.pdf |work=[[Tapuitea]] |publisher= |date=July 12, 2006 |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110926183511/http://americansamoa.gov/tapuitea/2006/Tapuitea60712.pdf |archivedate=September 26, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=snews>{{cite news|title=Manu'a celebrates 105 years under the U.S. Flag |url=http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=7779 |work=[[Samoa News]] |publisher= |date=July 16, 2009 |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20110927012532/http://www.samoanews.com/viewstory.php?storyid=7779 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>

====World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic====
[[File:Gov12.JPG|thumb|[[John Martin Poyer|Cdr. John Martin Poyer]] served as the [[List of governors of American Samoa|12th]] Governor of American Samoa (1915-1919)<ref>http://www.highlinehistory.org/oral_histories/Life_in_Samoa.pdf</ref>]]

In 1918 during the final stages of [[World War I]], the [[1918 flu pandemic|flu pandemic]] had taken its toll, spreading rapidly from country to country. American Samoa became one of only three places in the world (the others being [[New Caledonia]] and [[Marajó|Marajó island]] in Brazil) to have prevented any deaths during the pandemic through the quick response from [[John Martin Poyer|Governor John Martin Poyer]] after hearing news reports of the outbreak on the radio and requesting [[quarantine ships]] from the US mainland. The result of Poyer's quick actions earned him the [[Navy Cross]] from the [[United States Navy|US Navy]]. With this distinction, American Samoans regarded Poyer as their hero for what he had done to prevent the deadly disease. The neighboring New Zealand territory at the time [[Samoa|Western Samoa]] suffered the most of all Pacific islands with 90% of the population infected, 30% of adult men, 22% of adult women and 10% of children died. Poyer offered assistance to help his New Zealand counterparts, but was refused by the administrator of Western Samoa [[Robert Logan (politician)|Robert Logan]] who became outraged after witnessing the number of quarantine ships surrounding American Samoa. Angered by this, Logan had cut off communications with his American counterparts.

====Interwar period====

=====American Samoa Mau movement=====
After World War I, during the time of the [[Mau movement]] in Western Samoa (then a [[League of Nations]] mandate governed by New Zealand), there was a corresponding American Samoa Mau movement led by Samuelu Ripley, a World War I veteran who was from Leone village, Tutuila. After meetings in the United States mainland, he was prevented from disembarking from the ship that brought him home to American Samoa and was not allowed to return because the American Samoa Mau movement was suppressed by the US Navy. In 1930 the US Congress sent a committee to investigate the status of American Samoa, led by Americans who had a part in the overthrow of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]].

=====Annexation of Swains Island=====
[[Swains Island]], which had been included in the list of guano islands [[wikt:appertain|appertain]]ing to the United States and bonded under the [[Guano Islands Act]], was annexed in 1925 by Pub. Res. 68-75.<ref>Pub. Res. 68-75, {{USStat|43|1357}}, enacted March 4, 1925</ref>

=====Pan American and first trans-South Pacific flight=====
[[File:Sikorsky S42 (crop).jpg|thumb|right|The ''Samoan Clipper'']]

In 1938, the noted aviator [[Ed Musick]] and his crew died on the [[Pan American World Airways]] S-42 ''[[Samoan Clipper]]'' over Pago Pago, while on a survey flight to [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]]. Sometime after takeoff, the aircraft experienced trouble, and Musick turned it back toward Pago Pago. While the crew dumped fuel in preparation for an emergency landing, an explosion occurred that tore the aircraft apart.<ref>[http://www.clipperflyingboats.com/pan-am-pilots/edwin-musick Edwin Musick]</ref>

====World War II and aftermath====
During [[World War II]], US Marines stationed in Samoa outnumbered the local population and had a huge cultural influence. Young Samoan men from age 14 and above were combat trained by US military personnel. Samoans served in various capacities during World War II, including as combatants, medical personnel, code personnel, and ship repairmen.

In 1949, Organic Act 4500, a US [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]]-sponsored attempt to incorporate American Samoa, was introduced in Congress. It was ultimately defeated, primarily through the efforts of Samoan chiefs, led by Tuiasosopo Mariota.<ref>Story of the Legislature of American Samoa. 1988.</ref> The efforts of these chiefs led to the creation of a territorial legislature, the [[American Samoa Fono]], which meets in the village of [[Fagatogo]].

====1951-1999====
By 1956, the navy-appointed governor was replaced by [[Peter Tali Coleman]], who was locally elected. Although technically considered "unorganized" since the US Congress has not passed an [[Organic Act]] for the territory, American Samoa is self-governing under a constitution that became effective on July 1, 1967. The US Territory of American Samoa is on the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]], a listing which is disputed by the territorial government officials, who do consider themselves to be self-governing.

[[File:Splashdown 2.png|thumb|Locations of [[Pacific Ocean]] splashdowns of American spacecraft]]
American Samoa and [[Pago Pago International Airport]] had historic significance with the [[Apollo Program]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.tripod.com/~Tavita_Herdrich/apollosummary.html |title=Apollo Splashdowns Near American Samoa |work=Tavita Herdrich and News Bulletin |accessdate=July 7, 2010}}</ref> The [[astronaut]] crews of [[Apollo 10]], [[Apollo 12|12]], [[Apollo 13|13]], [[Apollo 14|14]], and [[Apollo 17|17]] were retrieved a few hundred miles from Pago Pago and transported by helicopter to the airport prior to being flown to Honolulu on [[C-141 Starlifter]] military aircraft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17steen.html |title=Apollo 17 Lunar Surface Journal – Kevin Steen |work=Eric M. Jones |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}</ref>

While the two Samoas share language and ethnicity, their cultures have recently followed different paths, with American Samoans often emigrating to [[Hawaii|Hawai{{okina}}i]] and the US mainland, and adopting many US customs, such as the playing of [[American football]] and [[baseball]]. Western Samoans have tended to emigrate instead to [[New Zealand]], whose influence has made the sports of [[rugby football|rugby]] and [[cricket]] more popular in the western islands. Travel writer [[Paul Theroux]] noted that there were marked differences between the societies in Samoa and American Samoa.

===21st century===
Due to economic hardship, military service has been seen as an opportunity in American Samoa and other [[Territories of the United States#Classification of current U.S. territories|US Overseas territories]];<ref>{{cite news |title=In South Pacific, US Army has strong appeal |author=James Brooke |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=August 1, 2005 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/world/asia/31iht-saipan.html |accessdate=September 30, 2009}}</ref> this has meant that there have been a disproportionate number of casualties per population compared to other parts of the United States. As of March 23, 2009, there have been 10 American Samoans who have died in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraq]], and 2 who have died in [[OEF-A|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Congressman Faleomavaega |authorlink=Eni Faleomavaega |title=WASHINGTON, DC—AMERICAN SAMOA DEATH RATE IN THE IRAQ WAR IS HIGHEST AMONG ALL STATES AND US TERRITORIES |url=http://www.house.gov/list/press/as00_faleomavaega/asdeathratehighestamongstates.html |work=Press Release |publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]] |date=March 23, 2009 |accessdate=September 30, 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20091009100120/http://www.house.gov/list/press/as00_faleomavaega/asdeathratehighestamongstates.html| archivedate= October 9, 2009 | deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=February 2014}}</ref>

===Notable events===
On December 10, 1787, French navigator [[Jean-François de Galaup, comte de Lapérouse]] landed two exploration parties on Tutuila's north shore: one from the ship La Boussole ("The Compass") at Fagasa, and the other from L' Astrolabe ("The Quadrant") at A'asu. One of the cooks, David, died of "scorbutic dropsy". On December 11, 1787, twelve members of Jean-François de La Pérouse's crew (including First Officer Paul-Antoine Fleuriot de Langle and 39 Samoans) were killed by angry Samoans at A'asu Bay, Tutuila, thereafter known as "Massacre Bay," which La Pérouse described as "this den, more fearful from its treacherous situation and the cruelty of its inhabitants than the lair of a lion or a tiger." This incident gave Samoa a reputation for savagery, and kept Europeans away until the arrival of the first Christian missionaries four decades later. On December 12, 1787, at A'asu Bay, Tutuila, French explorer Jean-François de La Pérouse ordered his gunners to fire one cannonball in the midst of the attackers who had killed twelve of his men the day before, and were now returning to launch another attack. He later wrote in his journal "I could have destroyed or sunk a hundred canoes, with more than 500 people in them: but I was afraid of striking the wrong victims; the call of my conscience saved their lives."  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamug.edu/samoa/a_asu/history.htm |title=A Brief History of "A'asu" |publisher=Tamug.edu |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marchant |first=Leslie R. |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/la-perouse-jean-francois-de-galaup-2329 |title=Biography – Jean-François de Galaup La Pérouse - Australian Dictionary of Biography |publisher=Adb.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

On March 25, 1891, [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] paid a rare visit to Pago Pago.

On December 15, 1916, English writer [[William Somerset Maugham]] arrived in Pago Pago, allegedly accompanied by a missionary and Miss Sadie Thompson. His visit inspired his short story "Rain", which later became plays and three major Motion Pictures. The building Maugham stayed during his visit still stands and has been for decades renamed [[Sadie Thompson Building]]. Today it is a prominent restaurant and Inn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sadieshotels.com/hotels/sadie-thompson-inn |title=Sadie Thompson Inn &#124; Sadie's Hotels |publisher=Sadieshotels.com |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

On November 3, 1920, American Samoa's 12th naval governor Commander [[Warren Jay Terhune]], committed suicide with a pistol in the bathroom of the Government mansion, overlooking the entrance to Pago Pago Harbor. His body was discovered by Government House's cook, SDI First Class Felisiano Debid Ahchica, USN. (His ghost is rumored to walk about the grounds at night).<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Robert Patterson |url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/wjterhune.htm |title=Warren Jay Terhune, Commander, United States Navy |publisher=Arlingtoncemetery.net |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Fagatogo Dock.jpg|thumb|Pago Pago Harbor today and inter-island dock area.]]
On August 11, 1925, [[Margaret Mead]] arrived in American Samoa aboard SS ''Sonoma'' to begin fieldwork for her doctoral dissertation in anthropology at Columbia University, where she was a student of Professor [[Franz Boas]]. Her work [[Coming of Age in Samoa]] was published in 1928, at the time becoming the most widely read book in the field of [[anthropology]]. The book however has sparked years of ongoing and intense debate and controversy.<ref>http://www.mmisi.org/ir/35_01/50worst.pdf</ref> The traditionalist conservative Intercollegiate Studies Institute listed Coming of Age in Samoa as #1 as the "50 Worst Books of the Twentieth Century". Mead returned to American Samoa one last time in 1971 for the dedication of the Jean P. Haydon Museum.

On November 24, 1939, American Samoa's last execution was carried out. Imoa, who was convicted of stabbing Sema to death, was hanged in the Customs House. The popular Samoan song "Fa'afofoga Samoa" said to be the final words of Imoa are based on these events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asbar.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=384:american-samoa-govt-v-imoa&catid=47:2asr&Itemid=228 |title=American Samoa Gov't v. Imoa |publisher=Asbar.org |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

On January 11, 1942, at 2:26&nbsp;a.m., "a Japanese submarine surfaced about 10,000 yards off the north coast of Tutuila between Southworth Point and Fagasa Bay," and fired about fifteen projectiles from its 5.5-inch deck gun at the U.S. Naval Station Tutuila over a period of approximately ten minutes. The first shell struck the rear of the store of Frank Shimasaki, one of Tutuila's few Japanese residents. The store was closed at the time, as Mr. Shimasaki was interned because of his "foreign background." The next one inflicted slight damage on the naval dispensary; the third landed on the lawn behind the naval quarters known as "Centipede Row," while the fourth hit the stone seawall outside the customs house. The others fell harmlessly into the harbor. "The fire was not returned, notwithstanding the eagerness of the Samoan Marines to test their skill against the enemy....No American or Samoan Marines were wounded." Commander Edwin B.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, American Samoa played a pivotal role in five of the Apollo Program missions. Astronauts returned to Earth just a few hundred miles from Pago and were transported to the islands en route home to the mainland.

On January 30, 1974, [[Pan Am Flight 806]], arriving on Wednesday night from Auckland, New Zealand, with 91 passengers aboard, crashed at Pago Pago International Airport at 10:41&nbsp;p.m. 86 people were killed, including Captain Leroy A. Petersen and the entire flight crew. Five passengers were injured: four seriously, and one minor. The plane was demolished by impact and fire. The crash was variously attributed to poor visibility, pilot error or wind shear. A violent storm was raging when the plane crashed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.samoanews.com/?q=node/80385 |title=PAGO'S WORST AIR DISASTER, PAN AM FLIGHT 806 SUBJECT OF DOCUMENTARY |publisher=Samoa News |date= |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref> In January 2014, filmmaker Paul Crompton visited the territory to interview local residents for a documentary film about the 1974 crash.

On April 17, 1980, during Flag Day celebrations in American Samoa, a US Navy patrol plane, carrying six skydivers from the US Army's Hawaii-based Tropic Lightning Parachute Club, had its vertical stabilizer shorn off by the Solo Ridge-Mount Alava aerial tramway cable, which stretches across Pago Pago Harbor. The plane crashed, demolishing a wing of the Rainmaker Hotel and killing seven people (all six crew members and one civilian). All six skydivers were reported in good condition. A memorial monument is erected on Mt. Mauga O Ali'i to honor their memory.

On July 22, 2010, Det. Lt. Lusila Brown was fatally shot outside the temporary High Court building in Fagatogo. The murder sent shock and panic waves throughout an island normally unscathed by gun violence. It was the first time in more than 15 years that a police officer was killed in the line of duty. The last was Sa Fuimaono, who drowned after saving a teenager from rough seas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/07/23/man-fatally-shoots-american-samoa-police-officer-outside-courthouse-just/ |title=Man fatally shoots American Samoa police officer outside courthouse just after hearing |publisher=Fox News |date=July 23, 2010 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Government and politics==

===Government===
{{Main|Government of American Samoa}}
The [[government of American Samoa]] is defined under the [[Constitution of American Samoa]] as an [[unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territory]]; the [[Ratification Act of 1929]] vested all civil, judicial, and military powers in the [[President of the United States|President of the United States of America]].

KENNEDY PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY AND MUSEUM|access-date=}}</ref> On June 2, 1967, Interior Secretary [[Fred Andrew Seaton]] promulgated the Constitution of American Samoa, which took effect on July 1, 1967.

[[File:Mary Tulafono and Togiola Tulafono.jpg|thumb|left|Former [[First Lady of American Samoa|First Lady]] Mary Tulafono and former Governor [[Togiola Tulafono]]]]
The [[Governor of American Samoa]] is the [[head of government]] and along with the [[Lieutenant Governor of American Samoa]] is elected on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] by [[popular vote]] for four-year terms. Since American Samoa is a self-governing territory, the [[President of the United States]] serves as the Head of State. He does not play an active role in government, but he can dissolve the Fono and no act of parliament will become law without his approval.

The [[legislative power]] is vested in the [[American Samoa Fono]], which has two [[bicameralism|chambers]]. The [[American Samoa House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has 21 members, elected for a two-year term, 20 in single-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] and one by a public meeting on [[Swain Island]]. The [[American Samoa Senate|Senate]] also has 18 members, elected for a four-year term by and from the chiefs of the islands.

The [[judiciary of American Samoa]] is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the [[High Court of American Samoa]] is the highest court below the [[United States Supreme Court]] in American Samoa, with the District Courts below it. The High Court is located in the capital of [[Pago Pago]]. It consists of a Chief Justice and an Associate Justice, appointed by the United States Secretary of the Interior.

===Politics===
{{main|Politics of American Samoa}}
{{see also|Elections in American Samoa|Political party strength in American Samoa}}
Politics of American Samoa takes place in a framework of a [[presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[Dependent territory|dependency]], whereby the [[List of American Samoa Governors|Governor]] is the [[head of government]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] [[multi-party system]]. American Samoa is an unincorporated and [[unorganized territory]] of the United States, administered by the [[Office of Insular Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of the Interior]]. Its constitution was ratified in 1966 and came into effect in 1967. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the governor. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the two chambers of the legislature. The American political parties (Republican and Democratic) exist in American Samoa, but few politicians are aligned with the parties. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

There is also the traditional village politics of the Samoa Islands, the "fa'amatai" and the "fa'asamoa", which continues in American Samoa and in independent Samoa, and which interacts across these current boundaries. The Fa'asamoa is the language and customs, and the Fa'amatai the protocols of the "fono" (council) and the chief system. The Fa'amatai and the Fono take place at all levels of the Samoan body politic, from the family, to the village, to the region, to national matters.

The "matai" (chiefs) are elected by consensus within the fono of the extended family and village(s) concerned. The matai and the fono (which is itself made of matai) decide on distribution of family exchanges and tenancy of communal lands. The majority of lands in American Samoa and independent Samoa are communal. A matai can represent a small family group or a great extended family that reaches across islands, and to both American Samoa and independent Samoa.

In 2010, voters rejected a [[American Samoan constitutional referendum, 2010|package of amendments]] to the territorial constitution, which would have, among other things, allowed only US citizens with Samoan ancestry to be legislators.

In 2012, both the Governor and American Samoa's delegate to the US Congress [[Eni Faleomavaega]] called for the populace to consider a move towards autonomy if not independence, to a mixed response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/american-samoa-must-consider-independence-congressman/946070 |title=American Samoa must consider independence – congressman |publisher=Radioaustralia.net.au |date=May 18, 2012 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2012-05-18/call-for-independence-discussion-for-american-samoa/946016 |title=Call for independence discussion for American Samoa |publisher=Radioaustralia.net.au |date=May 18, 2012 |accessdate=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of American Samoa}}

Employment on the island falls into three relatively equal-sized categories of approximately 5,000 workers each: the public sector, the single remaining [[tuna]] [[cannery]], and the rest of the private sector.

There are only a few [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] employees in American Samoa and no [[active duty]] military personnel except members of the U.S. Coast Guard, although there is an [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] unit. There is also a U.S. Army recruiting station in Utulei.

The overwhelming majority of public sector employees work for the American Samoa territorial government. The one tuna cannery, [[StarKist Tuna|StarKist]], exports several hundred million dollars worth of canned tuna to the United States each year. The other tuna cannery, Samoa Packing, a Chicken of the Sea subsidiary, closed in 2009 due to American Samoans being granted minimum wage.<ref name=minimumwage>{{cite web|url=http://www.europac.net/commentaries/congress_sacks_samoan_economy |title=Congress Sacks Samoan Economy |publisher=Europac.net |date=January 22, 2010 |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}</ref> In early 2007 the Samoan economy was highlighted in the [[United States Congress|Congress]] as it was not mentioned in the [[minimum wage]] bill, at the request of the Samoan delegate to the [[United States House of Representatives]], [[Eni Faleomavaega]].{{clarify|date=October 2010}}

From 2002 to 2007, real GDP of American Samoa increased at an average annual rate of 0.4 percent. The annual growth rates of real GDP ranged from −2.9 percent to +2.1 percent. The volatility in the growth rates of real GDP was primarily accounted for by changes in the exports of canned tuna. The tuna canning industry was the largest private employer in American Samoa during this period.

====American football====
About 30 ethnic Samoans, all from American Samoa, currently play in the [[National Football League]], and more than 200 play [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[college football]].<ref name="Football Island">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18560_162-6875877.html|title=American Samoa: Football Island |first=Scott |last=Pelley |work=[[60 Minutes]] |date=January 17, 2010 |accessdate=January 20, 2010}}</ref> In recent years, it has been estimated that a Samoan male (either an American Samoan, or a Samoan living in the mainland United States) is anywhere from 40<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2002/0527/1387626.html |title=The Walt Disney Internet Group (WDIG) – The Dominican Republic of the NFL |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=July 25, 2010}}</ref> to 56 times<ref name="Football Island"/> more likely to play in the NFL than a non-Samoan American.

[[Pittsburgh Steelers]] safety [[Troy Polamalu]], though born and raised in the mainland U.S., is perhaps the most famous Samoan currently in the NFL, not having his hair cut since 2000 (and only because a [[USC Trojans football|USC]] coach told him he had to) and wearing it down during games in honor of his heritage. The football culture was featured on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' January 17, 2010.

====Association football====
[[American Samoa national association football team]] is one of the newest teams in the world, and is also noted for being the world's weakest.

====Rugby league====
The [[American Samoa national rugby league team]] represents the country in international [[rugby league]]. The team competed in the 1988, 1992, 1998 and 2004 [[Rugby League Pacific Cup|Pacific Cup]] competitions. The team has also competed in the 2003 and 2004 [[Rugby League World Sevens|world sevens]] qualifiers in the 2005 [[Rugby League World Sevens|World sevens]].

There is also a new movement which aims to set up a four team domestic competition in American Samoa.<ref name="rugbyleagueplanet1"/>

====Rugby union====
Rugby union is a growing sport in American Samoa. The first rugby game recorded in American Samoa was in 1924, since then the development of the game had been heavily overshadowed by the influence of [[American Football]] during the 1970s. The highest governing body of rugby in American Samoa is the [[American Samoa Rugby Union]] which was founded in 1990 and was not affiliated into the [[World Rugby|IRB]] until 2012. Internationally, two American Samoans have played for the [[New Zealand]] national rugby union team, known as the [[All Blacks]]. [[Frank Solomon]] (born in [[Pago Pago]]) became the first American national of Samoan descent to play for a New Zealand team. Considered a pacific pioneer in New Zealand rugby, Solomon scored a try against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in the inaugural [[Bledisloe Cup]] match in 1932, which New Zealand won 21-13. The second American Samoan to play for the All Blacks is [[Jerome Kaino]] (born in [[Faga'alu]]). A native of [[Leone, American Samoa|Leone]], Kaino moved to New Zealand when he was 4 years old. In 2004 at age 21, he played his first match for New Zealand against the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] where he scored his first try, contributing to New Zealand's 47-19 victory that resulted in him becoming man of the match. He also played a crucial role in the [[Rugby World Cup 2011]] playing every match in the tournament. He scored four tries in the event which led to New Zealand winning the final against [[France national rugby union team|France]] 8-7. Kaino was also a key member of the [[Rugby World Cup 2015|2015 Rugby World Cup]] squad, where he played every match including a try he scored in the quarterfinals against [[France national rugby union team|France]] which New Zealand won 62-13. He scored again in the semifinals against [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], which New Zealand won 20-18. He played in the world cup final against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] where New Zealand won again 34-17 to become world champions for a record 3 times (1987, 2011 and 2015). Kaino is one of twenty New Zealand rugby players to have won the Rugby World Cup twice, back to back in 2011 and 2015.

====Sumo wrestling====
Some Samoan [[Sumo]] wrestlers, most famously [[Musashimaru]] and [[Konishiki]] have reached the highest ranks of ''[[ōzeki]]'' and ''[[Yokozuna (sumo)|yokozuna]]''.

====Track and field====
Hammer thrower [[Lisa Misipeka]] attracted international attention by winning a bronze medal in the [[1999 World Championships in Athletics]].
