'''Asistencia Asesoría y Administración LLC (AAA)''' (Spanish for "Assistance, Assessment, and Administration") is a [[lucha libre]] [[professional wrestling promotion]] based in [[Mexico]]. Founded in 1992 when [[Antonio Peña]] broke away from [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) to set up a promotion, which allowed him more [[creativity|creative freedom]], AAA has held a number of [[pay-per-view]]s (PPV) over the years and has promoted shows not just in Mexico but in the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] as well. The promotion utilizes both a [[hexagon]]al and the more conventional four-sided [[wrestling ring]] and has a reputation for its outlandish gimmicks and characters as well as having developed a more [[Hardcore wrestling|extreme]] match style over the last couple of years. Over the years AAA has worked together with several North American promotions such as the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) and [[World Championship Wrestling]]; while currently having a working relationship with Japan-based [[Pro Wrestling Noah]], US-based [[Global Force Wrestling]] (GFW) and the Canadian-based [[International Wrestling Syndicate]] (IWS).

==History==
[[File:Lucha Libre AAA.png|200px|thumb|left|First logo.]]
AAA dates from May 15, 1992, when [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) booker [[Antonio Peña]] broke with the company in favor of establishing his own group along with [[Konnan]] and much of the young and exciting [[skilled worker|talent]] from CMLL.<ref>Guerrero, Eddie. ''Cheating Death, Stealing Life: The Eddie Guerrero Story'', p. 78.</ref> This left CMLL with a middle-aged roster and a seemingly bleak future. AAA also looked for talent from other markets, as they found and signed Tijuana natives [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Mysterio, Jr.]] and [[Psicosis]]. The promotion flourished with top talent like [[El Hijo del Santo]], [[Octagón]], [[Blue Panther]], the Casas brothers ([[Negro Casas]] and [[Erick Casas|Heavy Metal]]) and possessed top draws in [[Los Gringos Locos]], [[Cien Caras]], [[Konnan]], and [[Perro Aguayo]]. The rising popularity of AAA soon caused rival [[Universal Wrestling Association]] to go out of business, and Peña quickly signed up top [[Professional wrestling terms#D|draws]] including [[El Canek]], Dos Caras and Los Villanos.

[[File:AAA-Sin-Limite.png|right|thumb|Logo of ''AAA Sin Límite'' program.]]
AAA's "golden years" (from 1993-1995) peaked with the ''[[AAA When Worlds Collide|When Worlds Collide]]'' [[pay-per-view]], promoted in conjunction with [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) and broadcast in the [[United States]] in 1994. Weeks after the show, [[Art Barr]] (a key member of [[Los Gringos Locos]]) died while visiting his family. As a result, AAA vacated the AAA Tag Team Championships, and this led to the departure of fellow stable-mates (in Los Gringos Locos) [[Eddie Guerrero]] and [[Louie Spicolli|Madonna's Boyfriend]]. El Hijo del Santo also departed as a result of creative problems, and stars such as [[Fuerza Guerrera]] and Blue Panther soon left too when the Mexican economy began to slow down (which resulted in the company's inability to offer as much work). Many wrestlers, including [[Rey Mysterio|Rey Misterio, Jr.]], [[Psicosis]], [[La Parka]], and [[Juventud Guerrera]], would also depart to WCW in 1996, as well as Konnan's short-lived Promo Azteca promotion. In early 1997, AAA established a working agreement with [[WWE]], but the only significant outcome resulted in several luchadores featuring in the 1997 ''[[Royal Rumble (1997)|Royal Rumble]]''.

AAA broadcasts shows regularly on [[Gala TV (Mexico)|Gala TV]] in Mexico and [[Univision Deportes Network|Univision TDN]] in Mexico and parts of the United States.

On October 6, 2006, founder [[Antonio Peña]] died of a heart attack. Following Peña's death his sister Marisela manages AAA financially, while Peña's brother-in-law Joaquín Roldán and his son, Dorian Roldán serve as operational managers. In 2008 Lucha Libre USA presented AAA's second U.S. pay-per-view, ''Legendary Battles of Triplemania''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indemand.com/product/view/91382|title=Lucha Libre: Legendary Battles Of Triplemania|accessdate=2009-06-27|publisher=In Demand!}}</ref> In 2009 AAA announced the official release of a video game originally entitled ''AAA El Videojuego''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/aaaelvideojuego/news.html?sid=6212457&om_act=convert&om_clk=newsfeatures&tag=newsfeatures;|title=AAA Lucha Libre headed for US|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2009-06-27|publisher=[[Gamespot]]|first=Brendan|last=Sinclair}}
</ref> The game was later retitled ''[[Lucha Libre AAA: Héroes del Ring]]'' by the publisher of the game, with a release date of October 12, 2010.

AAA developed a working relationship with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] in 2004. Through the relationship, AAA sent the [[luchador]]es [[Juventud Guerrera]], [[Héctor Garza]], [[Abismo Negro]], [[Erick Casas|Heavy Metal]], and [[Mr. Águila]] to TNA to compete in the [[TNA X Cup|America's X-Cup Tournament]] as a contingent known as [[Team Mexico]]. Team Mexico dominated the America's X-Cup Tournament, defeating [[Team USA (professional wrestling)|Team USA]] in the first round before retaining the Cup against both [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]] and [[Team Britain]]. They eventually lost at the [[TNA X Cup|World X-Cup]], which saw [[Team USA (professional wrestling)|Team USA]] defeat [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]] and [[Team Mexico]] in the [[Ultimate X]] finals to win the Cup. For multiple reasons TNA and AAA broke off their working relationship late in 2004. TNA continued utilizing luchadores, but opted to contract them individually as opposed to working through AAA.In 2006, AAA and TNA worked again for an event in Toreo de Cuatro Caminos, utilizing some of TNA's talent and stage (which includes the tunnel and lasers). After [[Konnan]] left TNA in June 2007 any chance of a working relationship disappeared especially given that Konnan has filed a [[racial discrimination]] [[lawsuit]] against TNA, later dismissed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_31899.shtml | title=TNA News: TNA Wrestling and Konnan agree to drop lawsuits against each other, Dixie Carter comments on suit  | date=May 7, 2009 | accessdate=June 3, 2015 | publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch | first=James | last=Caldwell}}</ref> Afterwards TNA started a working relationship with AAA's rival CMLL. However, in February 2010 the companies once again began a working relationship and started exchanging talent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/viewnews.php?id=1268277107|title=TNA and AAA start talent exchange|last=Martin|first=Adam|date=2010-03-10|publisher=WrestleView|accessdate=2010-03-11}}</ref>

In April 2014, after [[Jeff Jarrett]], the man behind the AAA-TNA relationship, had left TNA, he announced that his new [[Global Force Wrestling]] (GFW) was now working with the Mexican promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_78082.shtml|title=GFW news: Global Force's latest announcement - "partnership agreement" with international promotion|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2014-04-30|accessdate=2014-04-30|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref>

On January 12, 2014, it was announced that, with the backing of [[Mark Burnett]], AAA would begin airing a show on American network [[El Rey (network)|El Rey]] on the second half of the year. The one-hour weekly program would be accompanied by monthly and quarterly specials as well as live pay-per-views.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_75631.shtml|title=Mexico news: AAA officially bringing TV to the U.S., has backing of big-name TV producer|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2014-01-12|accessdate=2014-01-12|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> The show, titled ''[[Lucha Underground]]'', premiered on October 29, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/118-daily-updates/39066-lucha-underground-promotion-tv-debut-moved-back-three-weeks|title=Lucha Underground promotion TV debut moved back three weeks|date=2014-09-22|accessdate=2014-09-23|work=[[Dave Meltzer#Wrestling Observer Newsletter|Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}</ref>

On July 4, 2015, Canadian-based [[International Wrestling Syndicate]] (IWS) announced a talent partnership with AAA and [[Lucha Underground]].<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/IWSHardcore/posts/820574471389632 "IWS formed partnership with AAA wrestling and Lucha Underground"], ''International Wrestling Syndicate'', Retrieved on July 5, 2015.</ref><ref>Laprade, Patric.

==Championships==
Since its inception AAA has placed very few restrictions on the number of championships it promotes, often allowing wrestlers to defend titles that do not technically belong within AAA, such as titles from the now defunct [[Universal Wrestling Association]]. While they allowed these to be defended and used to promote their wrestlers they're not officially listed as AAA titles and thus do not appear on this list. In December 2008 AAA announced it they will no longer recognize or promote any title that does not belong to AAA - ending the long-standing practice.<ref name="AAAOnly">{{cite web | url = http://superluchas.net/?p=9627 | title = ¿AAA dejará de contar campeonatos de terceros? | accessdate = 2009-02-22 |publisher = Super Luchas | language = Spanish| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090204111153/http://superluchas.net/?p=9627| archivedate= 4 February 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}
