==History==

===Early history===
There has been a settlement in the area for over 4,000 years.<ref>[http://www.kirklees.gov.uk/events/venuedetails.asp?vID=45 Kirklees Council Website Castle Hill]</ref> The remains of a [[castra|Roman fort]] were unearthed in the mid 18th century at [[Slack Roman fort|Slack]] near [[Outlane]], west of the town.<ref>[http://www.huddersfield1.co.uk/huddersfield/tolson/roman_times/index.htm Huddersfield One – Tolson Museum Booklets]</ref> [[Castle Hill, Huddersfield|Castle Hill]], a major landmark, was the site of an [[Iron Age]] [[hill fort]]. Huddersfield was recorded in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086 as ''Oderesfelt'' and ''Odresfeld''.

Huddersfield has been a [[market town]] since [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] times. The [[market cross]] is on Market Place.

The manor of Huddersfield was owned by the [[de Lacy family]] until 1322, at which it reverted to royal ownership. In 1599, [[William Ramsden (died 1623)|William Ramsden]] bought the manor, and the Ramsden family continued to own the manor, which came to be known as the 'Ramsden Estate', until 1920. During their ownership they supported the development of the town, building the Huddersfield Cloth Hall in 1766 and the [[Sir John Ramsden’s Canal]] in 1780, and supporting the arrival of the railway arrived in the 1840s.<ref name=hudhist>{{cite web | title = Huddesfield's history | url = http://huddersfieldhistory.wordpress.com/huddersfields-history/ | publisher = Huddersfield Local History Society | accessdate = 22 January 2014}}</ref>

===Industrial Revolution===
Huddersfield was a centre of civil unrest during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. In a period where Europe was experiencing frequent wars, where trade had slumped and the crops had failed, many local [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] faced losing their livelihood due to the introduction of machinery in factories. [[Luddite]]s began destroying mills and machinery in response; one of the most notorious attacks was on Cartwright — a Huddersfield mill-owner, who had a reputation for cruelty — and his Rawfolds Mill. In his book ''Rebels Against the Future'', [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] describes how an army platoon was stationed at Huddersfield to deal with Luddites; at its peak, there were about a thousand soldiers in Huddersfield and ten thousand civilians. In response, Luddites began to focus attacks on nearby towns and villages, which were less well-protected; the largest act of damage that they committed was the destruction of Foster's Mill at [[Horbury]] — a village about {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Huddersfield.<ref>{{cite book

===Political history===
Two [[Prime Minister]]s have spent part of their childhood in Huddersfield: [[Harold Wilson]] and [[H. H. Asquith|Herbert Asquith]]. Wilson is commemorated by a statue in front of the railway station.

Kirklees Council was the first in the UK to have a [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] councillor, Nicholas Harvey who was instrumental in protesting against the intended closure of the [[Settle and Carlisle Railway]] line.<ref>{{cite web

Centre-right and rightist groups are also active.

==Governance==
[[File:Huddersfield-coa.gif|thumb|left|[[Coat of arms of Huddersfield|Coat of arms of the former County Borough]]]]
Huddersfield was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in the ancient [[West Riding of Yorkshire]] in 1868. The borough comprised the [[parish]]es of Almondbury, Dalton, Huddersfield, Lindley-cum-Quarmby and Lockwood. When the West Riding County Council was formed in 1889, Huddersfield became a [[county borough]], exempt from county council control.

In 1920, the Corporation bought the Ramsden Estate from the Ramsden family, that had owned much of the town since 1599, for the sum of £1.3&nbsp;million. As a result, the town became known for a time as ‘the town that bought itself’. To this day, much of the freehold of the town belongs to the local authority.<ref name=hudhist/>

Huddersfield expanded in 1937, assimilating parts of the [[Golcar]], [[Linthwaite]], and [[South Crosland]] urban districts.<ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/relationships.jsp?u_id=10166937&c_id=10001043

 |accessdate=9 October 2008}}</ref> The county borough was abolished in 1974 and its former area was combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees in West Yorkshire.

Attempts by the council to gain support for [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] were rejected by the population in an unofficial referendum held by the ''[[Huddersfield Daily Examiner]]''. The council did not apply for that status in either the 2000 or 2002 competitions.<ref>{{cite web

Huddersfield had a strong [[Liberalism|liberal]] tradition up to the 1950s reflected in the number of liberal social clubs in the town. The current [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) for the [[Huddersfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Huddersfield constituency]] is [[Barry Sheerman]], a [[Labour Co-operative]] member.

According to the [[United Kingdom Census 2001]] the population of the Huddersfield [[urban area|urban]] sub-area of the [[West Yorkshire Urban Area]] was 146,234, and the population of the former area of the county borough was 121,620. The wider South Kirklees area had a population of 216,011.

==Industry==
Huddersfield is a [[manufacturing]] town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced woollen [[textile]]s. This area of business, along with the chemical and and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was the basis of the town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of [[Woolen|woollen]] products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making [[alternating current]] electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just £300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest’s sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of £4,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas’s Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley. Other local manufacturers are [[Cummins|Cummins Turbo Technologies]] (turbochargers), David Brown Gear systems (industrial gearing), Huddersfield Fine Worsteds (textiles), Taylor & Lodge (textiles), C & J Antich (textiles), Syngenta AG ([[Agrichemical|agro-chemicals]]), [[Pennine Radio Limited]] ([[electronics]] [[transformer]]s and sheet [[metalworking]]) and a large number of niche manufacturers, such as Dual Seal Glass (maker of spandrel glass panels<ref>{{cite news|last=Zientek |first=Henryk |url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/business/dual-seal-glass-named-business-4963685 |title=Dual Seal Glass named Business of the Year |newspaper=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner |date=4 November 2011 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref>) and Ellis Furniture (producer of kitchen and bathroom furniture<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshirelife.co.uk/homes-gardens/interiors/ellis_furniture_the_huddersfield_family_business_still_going_strong_after_120_years_1_1571449 |title=Ellis Furniture - the Huddersfield family business still going strong after 120 years - Interiors |newspaper=Yorkshire Life |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref>). Huddersfield is home to Andrew Jones Pies, a regional award winning pie-maker, where a worker was killed in a gas explosion on 10 April 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/7993407.stm |work=BBC News |title=One dead in pie factory explosion |date=10 April 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bradford/7997976.stm |work=BBC News |title=Meeting over pie factory future |date=14 April 2009}}</ref> and [[Mamas and Papas]] – a manufacturer and retailer of prams, pushchairs and related items.

==Geography==

Huddersfield has an abundance of [[Victorian architecture]].<ref>[http://www.kirklees.gov.uk/business/regeneration/ldf/pdf/townCentres/Huddersfield_2002_fact_sheet_6.pdf Kirklees council 2002 fact sheet]</ref> The most conspicuous landmark is the Victoria Tower on Castle Hill. Overlooking the town, the tower was constructed to mark [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria's]] 60th Jubilee Year. A picture of the Victoria Tower features on the [[New Zealand]] wine ''Castle Hill''.

[[File:Town Hall and Concert Hall - geograph.org.uk - 321863.jpg|thumb|right|Huddersfield Town Hall]]
Huddersfield Town Hall was designed by John H. Abbey and built in two stages between 1875 and 1881. The first section opened on 26 June 1878, comprising the Mayor's Parlour, Council Chamber, Reception Room and municipal offices including the Sanitary Inspector, Inspector of Weights and Measures, Medical Officer, Town Clerk, Borough Surveyor and the Rates Office. The second phase opened in October 1881 comprising the Magistrates' Court and Concert Hall. The hall seats up to 1,200 people and hosts events ranging from classical to comedy and from choral to community events.

The [[colonnade]]d [[Huddersfield railway station]] in St George's Square was once described as 'a [[stately home]] with trains in it', and by [[Nikolaus Pevsner|Sir Nikolaus Pevsner]] as 'one of the best early railway stations in England'.<ref name="pevsner">{{cite book

[[St Peter's Church, Huddersfield|St Peter's Church]] (Huddersfield [[Parish Church]]) was constructed in 1838 and is adjacent to the town centre, on Byram Street, near the Pack Horse Centre.

The Pack Horse Centre is a covered [[pedestrianised]] shopping area constructed over a [[cobblestone]] street, Pack Horse Yard, renamed Pack Horse Walk. [[Pack horse]]s carried merchandise over pack-horse routes across the [[Pennines]] before [[Toll road|turnpike]] roads and railways improved transportation. The pedestrian link passes from Kirkgate, across King Street and along Victoria Lane, by the Shambles, to the Piazza and the distinctive Market Hall at Queensgate, which was built to replace the old Shambles Market Hall in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite web

[[Beaumont Park]] about {{convert|2|mi|km}} to the south of the town centre was bequeathed to the town in the 1880s, by the [http://www.kirkheatononlineparishclerk.com/kirkheaton/beaumont.htm Henry Ralph Beaumont ('Beaumont's of Whitley' estate)] and was opened on 13 October 1883, by [[Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany|Prince Leopold]], fourth son of [[Queen Victoria]], and his wife [[Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont]] (The Duke and Duchess of Albany). It is a fine example of a [[Victorian era]] public park with water cascades, bandstand and woodland.

[[Greenhead Park]] is another large park in Huddersfield, situated around {{convert|0.4|mi|km}} west of the town centre. A multimillion-pound restoration project, funded by the Heritage Lottery fund<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2010/09/17/huddersfield-s-greenhead-park-to-be-even-greener-86081-27284504/ |title=Huddersfield's Greenhead Park to be even greener |newspaper=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner|date=17 September 2010|accessdate= 6 April 2013}}</ref> was finished in autumn 2012.

==Transport==

===Road===
[[File:Huddersfieldmap 1954.png|thumb|right|A map of Huddersfield from 1954]]
Huddersfield is connected to the national [[motorway]] network via the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M62 motorway|M62]] motorways. The M1 passes about {{convert|10|mi|km}} to the east. The M62 comes passes about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} to the north and Huddersfield is served by three junctions: Mount ([[A640 road|A640]], J23 – limited access), Ainley Top ([[A629 road|A629]], J24) and between [[Brighouse]] and Cooper Bridge ([[A644 road|A644]], J25).

Huddersfield Corporation built an inner [[ring road]], part of the [[A62 road|A62]], in the 1970s. The area within the ring road now  defines the town's [[central business district]]. The ring road relieves traffic congestion in the town centre where many roads are [[pedestrianised]].

Main routes into Huddersfield include the A62 Leeds Road, [[A641 road|A641]] Bradford Road, A629 Halifax Road – Penistone Road, A640 New Hey Road and the A62 Manchester Road.

===Rail===
[[Huddersfield railway station]] has a comprehensive local and regional rail service but there is no direct service to London, and passengers have to change at [[Manchester Piccadilly station|Manchester Piccadilly]], [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]], [[Wakefield Westgate railway station|Wakefield Westgate]] or [[Mirfield railway station|Mirfield]].<ref>[http://www.grandcentralrail.com/tickets-timetables/routes/ Grand Central Rail – Routes]</ref> Some services are subsidised by the public transport coordinator, [[West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive|Metro]]. A frequent express service operates to [[Dewsbury]], [[Leeds]] and [[Manchester]] and regular services to [[Darlington]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester Airport]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and [[York]] operated by [[First TransPennine Express]].

===Bus===
[[File:Hudds-ftb.jpg|thumb|right|The Huddersfield Free Town Bus]]
A [[Trolleybuses in Huddersfield|trolleybus system]] operated from 1933 to 1968.  [[Huddersfield bus station]] was opened by the Mayor, Councillor Mernagh on 26 March 1974, although it had not been completed.<ref>[http://www.huddersfield1.co.uk/huddersfield/huddsmemory.htm Huddersfield One – Huddersfield History since 1940]</ref> It is the busiest bus station in West Yorkshire with a daily footfall of almost 35,000. Most bus services pass through the bus station. Many services are subsidised by Metro.

Huddersfield's bus operators reflect the national situation; local subsidiaries of three dominant national operators provide most services in the area: [[First Calderdale & Huddersfield]] provide most local services in Huddersfield and some services outside Kirklees with destinations including Bradford, Brighouse, Halifax, Manchester and [[Oldham]]. [[Arriva Yorkshire]] provide frequent services to Dewsbury and Leeds, and [[Yorkshire Tiger]] provide almost all services in the south east of the town. Other smaller operators include [[Stotts Coaches]] and [[Yorkshire Tiger#Tiger Blue|Tiger Blue]]. Centrebus Holdings purchased Teamdeck in May 2008, along with Stagecoach Yorkshire's Huddersfield depot.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/express-and-chronicle/2008/05/03/stagecoach-operation-is-sold-but-not-to-arriva-86081-20874542/ |title=Stagecoach operation is sold - but not to Arriva|date= 3 May 2008|newspaper=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner|accessdate=19 August 2014}}</ref> In November 2006, a [[Zero-fare public transport|zero-fare]] town centre bus service, the [[FreeCityBus|Free Town Bus]], was launched run by K-Line in partnership with Kirklees Council and Metro.

===Canal===
The [[Huddersfield Broad Canal]], originally the Sir John Ramsden Canal, and the [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]] which are both navigable by [[narrowboat]], and the broad canal by wider craft, wind around the south side of town. To the rear of the [[YMCA]] in the [[Turnbridge]] section is an electrically operated road bridge, which is still in use, to raise the road and allow boat traffic to pass. This bridge originally used a [[windlass]].

==Sport==
[[File:Huddersfield 002.jpg|thumb|right|The [[John Smith's Stadium]]]]
[[Association football|Football]] and [[rugby league]] are the main spectator sports in Huddersfield. Its professional football team, [[Huddersfield Town F.C.]] play in [[Football League Championship|the Championship]]. In 1926, the club became the first in England to win three successive league titles, a feat only three other clubs have matched.

The town was the birthplace of rugby league, and is home to the [[Huddersfield Giants]] who play in the [[Super League]], the top division in Europe. The town is home to [[Huddersfield Underbank Rangers]] rugby league club, who play in the Rugby League Conference.
[[Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club]] play in the [[National Division Three North]] and [[Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules]] club. The main sporting arena is [[John Smith's Stadium]], home to both the football team and rugby league side.

===Rugby football===
Rugby was first played in the town in 1848 and the Huddersfield Athletic Club, the direct progenitors of Huddersfield Giants, formed in 1864, played its first rugby game in 1866. In Huddersfield on 29 August 1895, 22 northern clubs met in the [[George Hotel, Huddersfield|George Hotel]] and voted to [[Secession|secede]] from the [[Rugby Football Union]] and set up the 'Northern Rugby Football Union' which became the [[Rugby Football League]] in 1922. The [[Rugby League Heritage Centre]] is in the basement of the George Hotel.

Following the split of 1895, Huddersfield became a focus for rugby league and is represented by Huddersfield Giants in the Super League. [[Huddersfield Giants]], the town's rugby league club, has won the [[Rugby Football League Championship]] seven times, most recently in 1961–62, and the [[Challenge Cup]] six times, the last time in 1952–53.

After 1895 rugby was played exclusively under the auspices of the Northern Rugby Football Union until 1909 when Huddersfield Old Boys were formed to play under [[rugby union]] rules, playing nomadically at five grounds until buying farmland at Waterloo in 1919 and, in 1946, renaming the club [[Huddersfield Rugby Union Football Club|Huddersfield RUFC]]. In 1969 the club was at the forefront of a revolution in English rugby when it became the first club in the country to organise mini and junior rugby teams. The innovation spread and almost every club in the country has a thriving junior section providing a production-line of home-grown talent. Junior players at Huddersfield number over 200. In 1997 the Waterloo junior grounds were sold and the {{convert|26|acre|km2|sing=on}} former [[Bass Brewery]] site at Lockwood Park was purchased for its replacement. With the assistance of a £2&nbsp;million grant from [[Sport England]], the club has transformed it into a major sports complex, conference centre and business park.

===Association football===
[[Huddersfield Town F.C.]] is the town's senior [[association football]] team, founded in 1908, and currently playing in [[Football League Championship]].
In 1921–22 Huddersfield won the [[FA Cup]] and between 1923 and 1926 became the first club to win the [[Football League First Division|League Championship]] three times in a row, an achievement matched only by three other teams. However, they have been less successful in modern times, having not played in the top division since the early 1970s. The club left its ground at [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]] in 1994 and now shares the [[John Smith's Stadium]] with the Huddersfield Giants rugby league team.

Notable ex-players include [[Scotland|Scottish]] international [[Denis Law]], [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]], a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] winner with [[England national football team|England]] in 1966 and [[Trevor Cherry]], England international.
[[Herbert Chapman]], [[Bill Shankly]], [[Neil Warnock]] and [[Steve Bruce]] are notable former Huddersfield Town managers.

===Other sports===
[[Huddersfield Rams Aussie Rules]] is an Australian rules football team, formed in 2008. The club played its first season in 2009 and won the [[Aussie Rules UK]] National League – Central Division and took part in the North West Division in 2010.

==Present day==

===Shopping===
Huddersfield has a large and diverse retail shopping area — enclosed within the town's ring road — compared with other towns of its size. There are three shopping areas: [http://www.kingsgateshoppingcentre.co.uk/ Kingsgate], The Packhorse Precinct and [http://www.piazzacentre.co.uk/main The Piazza Centre]. The Piazza offers an outdoor shopping mall near the public library, with a grassed area, used for relaxation and events throughout the year such as entertainment, international markets and iceskating in winter. Through the adjacent Market Arcade is a covered market hall, which has listed building status, due in part to its distinctive roof formed by [[Hyperbola|hyperbolic]] [[paraboloid]]s. It is adjacent to the town hall and public library. An open market is located next to [[Tesco]], on the opposite side of the town centre.

The town centre is home to several national high street retailers and chain stores including [[Clinton Cards]], [[GAME (retailer)|GAME]], [[House of Fraser]], [[JD Sports]], [[Sports Direct]] (formerly JJB), [[W H Smith]]s and [[Wilkinson (retailer)|Wilkinsons]]; up until January 2008, it also had a [[Woolworths Group|Woolworths]]. Fast food outlets include [[KFC]], [[McDonald's]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Wimpy Bar|Wimpy]] and [[Nando's]]. High street clothing and fashion retail outlets such as [[British Home Stores]], [[Marks & Spencer]], [[River Island]], [[Topman]] and [[Next (clothing)|Next]]. There are three major [[supermarket]] outlets located in the town centre, and alongside the ring road: two [[Sainsbury's]] and one Tesco. In 2014 a small [[Morrisons]] store opened in the town centre located in the building previously occupied by [[Burger King]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/west-yorkshire-news/huddersfield-burger-king-closes-make-6176592/ |newspaper=The Huddersfield Daily Examiner|title=Huddersfield Burger King closes to make way for Morrisons store|accessdate=}}</ref> There are also a variety of small specialist and independent shops, many located in the three-storey Victorian shopping arcade,  [http://www.byramarcade.com/ Byram Arcade], situated on Westgate.

===Entertainment===
The [[Lawrence Batley Theatre]], opened in 1994, in what was once the largest [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Wesleyan Chapel]] in the world,<ref>{{Google books|hjM9AAAAIAAJ|Medicine and society in Wakefield and Huddersfield, 1780–1870|page=30}}</ref> and presents dance, drama, comedy, music and exhibitions and is the base for Full Body & the Voice, a company focusing on the integration of disabled people into mainstream theatre.

==Health==
[[File:HuddersfieldRoyalInfirmary.jpg|thumb|right|[[Huddersfield Royal Infirmary]].]]
[[Huddersfield Royal Infirmary]] is situated in [[Lindley, West Yorkshire|Lindley]]. Medical services are split between there and the [[Calderdale Royal Hospital]] at [[Salterhebble]], near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]]. [[Kirkwood Hospice]] provides care for the [[terminal illness|terminally ill]], and is dependent on donations and charitable gifts. Princess Royal Hospital provided [[maternity]] facilities until the risks of not being able to get an [[ambulance]] to [[Emergency department|A&E]] in the event of complications were judged to outweigh the benefits of specialist service provision. It now functions as a day clinic, [[family planning]] consultation centre and [[Sexual health clinic|GUM Clinic]]. A decision to move most maternity services provided by the Calderdale & Huddersfield NHS Foundation Trust to the Calderdale Royal Hospital ended the provision in 2007, despite strong local opposition. The campaign was led by [[Save Huddersfield NHS]] which elected a councillor, Dr Jackie Grunsell in the Crosland Moor ward.  In January 2016 plans were announced to close the A&E department of Huddersfield Royal Infirmary and have all emergency cases go to Calderdale Royal instead. This sparked uproar in local communities as it would mean journeys from some areas of over 40 minutes to and from the hospital assuming that the main road into Halifax was not congested, as it frequently is.<ref>{{cite news|title=RECAP: Huddersfield Royal Infirmary set to be demolished as part of A&E closure plan|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/recap-huddersfield-royal-infirmary-set-10739008|work=Huddersfield Examiner|date=15 January 2016}}</ref>

The former [[St. Luke's Hospital, Huddersfield|St. Luke's Hospital]] in [[Crosland Moor]] mostly provided [[geriatric]] and [[psychiatric]] care. It closed in 2011 and the land was sold to a developer.

[[File:Freedom Scroll DWR Huddersfield (RLH).JPG|thumb|right|upright|DWR Freedom Scroll]]
On 2 July 1952, in recognition of historic ties and links with the [[The Duke of Wellington's Regiment|Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding)]], the Huddersfield County Borough had conferred on the regiment the Freedom of the Town. This gave the regiment the right to march through the town with 'flags flying, bands playing and bayonets fixed'. Many of the town and district's male residents had served in the regiment during its long history. This right to march was technically lost when the County Borough itself was merged with Dewsbury to form Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council though, unofficially, continued as on 25 March 1979, Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council gave the Freedom of Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers. The 3rd Battalion was the Duke of Wellington's [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit.

[[File:Yorkshire Regiment, Freedom of Huddersfield(RLH)2008-10-25.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Conferring the Freedom of Huddersfield on the [[Yorkshire Regiment]] 25 October 2008]]
When the 'Dukes' were amalgamated with the [[Prince of Wales's Own Regiment of Yorkshire]] and the [[The Green Howards|Green Howards]]' to form the [[Yorkshire Regiment]] on 6 June 2006. The right to march was finally ended as the award did not give the right, for the freedom to march, to be passed on to any heirs or successors. The majority of the Yorkshire Regiment is now composed of soldiers from the north and eastern areas of Yorkshire. The Yorkshire Regiment requested the right to march to be transferred to them. However, the County Borough no longer exists and so there was no authority to do so. The 'Freedom' given by Kirklees to the 3rd battalion of the Yorkshire Volunteers did not permit any transfer to heirs or successors and effectively that freedom also ceased when the battalion was amalgamated into the [[East and West Riding Regiment]]. The East and West Riding Regiment ceased to exist on 6 June 2006, having been merged into the Yorkshire Regiment as its 4th Battalion. Kirklees Metropolitan Borough Council, as successors to the Huddersfield Borough Council, amended the original 'Freedom' and transferred the 'Freedom' to the Yorkshire Regiment, at a Freedom parade on 25 October 2008.

* [[Haddersfield, Jamaica]], locally referred to and named for Huddersfield<ref name="haddersfield">'During the periods 1822–1832 the 33rd Regiment of Foot, recruited from West Yorkshire was stationed in Jamaica. At the end of the tour 142 men chose to remain in Jamaica, having married and raised families, some of which may have originated from Huddersfield, thereby originating the name. Over 560 officers and men died and were buried in Jamaica during this period, from endemic diseases. On 18 June 1853 the regiment formally became known as "The 33rd (or The Duke of Wellington's) Regiment". The regiment's second battalion was again posted to Jamaica (Newcastle Camp) from 18 March 1891 to 10 April 1893. {{cite book
