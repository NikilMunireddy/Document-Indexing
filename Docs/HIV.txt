[[File:HIV-genome.png|thumb|450px|Structure of the RNA genome of HIV-1]]
The RNA genome consists of at least seven structural landmarks ([[Long terminal repeat|LTR]], [[Trans-activation response element (TAR)|TAR]], [[HIV Rev response element|RRE]], PE, SLIP, CRS, and INS), and nine genes (''gag'', ''pol'', and ''env'', ''tat'', ''rev'', ''nef'', ''vif'', ''vpr'', ''vpu'', and sometimes a tenth ''tev'', which is a fusion of tat env and rev), encoding 19 proteins. Three of these genes, ''gag'', ''pol'', and ''env'', contain information needed to make the structural proteins for new virus particles.<ref name=compendia/> For example, ''env'' codes for a protein called gp160 that is cut in two by a cellular protease to form gp120 and gp41. The six remaining genes, ''tat'', ''rev'', ''nef'', ''vif'', ''vpr'', and ''vpu'' (or ''vpx'' in the case of HIV-2), are regulatory genes for proteins that control the ability of HIV to infect cells, produce new copies of virus (replicate), or cause disease.<ref name=compendia/>

The two Tat proteins (p16 and p14) are [[Activator (genetics)|transcriptional transactivators]] for the LTR promoter acting by binding the TAR RNA element. The TAR may also be processed into [[microRNA]]s that regulate the [[apoptosis]] genes [[ERCC1]] and [[IER3]].<ref name="pmid18299284">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ouellet DL, Plante I, Landry P, Barat C, Janelle ME, Flamand L, Tremblay MJ, Provost P | title = Identification of functional microRNAs released through asymmetrical processing of HIV-1 TAR element | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 36 | issue = 7 | pages = 2353–65 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18299284 | pmc = 2367715 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn076 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/36/7/2353 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19220914">{{cite journal | vauthors = Klase Z, Winograd R, Davis J, Carpio L, Hildreth R, Heydarian M, Fu S, McCaffrey T, Meiri E, Ayash-Rashkovsky M, Gilad S, Bentwich Z, Kashanchi F | title = HIV-1 TAR miRNA protects against apoptosis by altering cellular gene expression | journal = Retrovirology | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | page = 18 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19220914 | pmc = 2654423 | doi = 10.1186/1742-4690-6-18 | url = http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/18 }}</ref>  The [[Rev (HIV)|Rev]] protein (p19) is involved in shuttling RNAs from the nucleus and the cytoplasm by binding to the [[HIV Rev response element|RRE]] RNA element.

[[File:HIV Mature and Immature.PNG|thumb|right|Diagram of the immature and mature forms of HIV]]
The term [[viral tropism]] refers to the cell types a virus infects. HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as [[Helper T cell|CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells]], [[macrophage]]s, and [[microglial cell]]s. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4<SUP>+</SUP> T cells is mediated through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with [[chemokine]] coreceptors.<ref name=Chan/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Arrildt|first1=Kathryn Twigg|last2=Joseph|first2=Sarah Beth|last3=Swanstrom|first3=Ronald|title=The HIV-1 Env Protein: A Coat of Many Colors|journal=Current HIV/AIDS Reports|date=March 2012|issue=Current HIV/AIDS Reports|pages=53–63}}</ref>

HIV-2 is much less pathogenic than HIV-1 and is restricted in its worldwide distribution. The adoption of "accessory genes" by HIV-2 and its more promiscuous pattern of coreceptor usage (including CD4-independence) may assist the virus in its adaptation to avoid innate restriction factors present in host cells. Adaptation to use normal cellular machinery to enable transmission and productive infection has also aided the establishment of HIV-2 replication in humans. A survival strategy for any infectious agent is not to kill its host but ultimately become a [[commensal]] organism. Having achieved a low pathogenicity, over time, variants more successful at transmission will be selected.<ref name= CheneyandMcKnight>{{cite book |vauthors=Cheney K, McKnight A |chapter=HIV-2 Tropism and Disease | year=2010 |title=Lentiviruses and Macrophages: Molecular and Cellular Interactions | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn=978-1-904455-60-8 }}</ref>

In addition, Hu and Temin<ref name=Hu /> suggested that recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized whether or not the two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but not the cause of, the evolution of template switching.<ref name=Bonhoeffer />

====Assembly and release====
[[File:HIV on macrophage.png|thumb|right|HIV assembling on the [[Cell membrane|surface]] of an infected [[macrophage]].]]
The final step of the viral cycle, assembly of new HIV-1 virions, begins at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The Env polyprotein (gp160) goes through the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and is transported to the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]] complex where it is cleaved by [[furin]] resulting in the two HIV envelope glycoproteins, [[gp41]] and [[gp120]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hallenberger S, Bosch V, Angliker H, Shaw E, Klenk HD, Garten W | title = Inhibition of furin-mediated cleavage activation of HIV-1 glycoprotein gp160 | journal = Nature | volume = 360 | issue = 6402 | pages = 358–61 | date = November 26, 1992 | pmid = 1360148 | doi = 10.1038/360358a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.360..358H }}</ref>  These are transported to the [[plasma membrane]] of the host cell where gp41 anchors gp120 to the membrane of the infected cell. The Gag (p55) and Gag-Pol (p160) polyproteins also associate with the inner surface of the plasma membrane along with the HIV genomic RNA as the forming virion begins to bud from the host cell. The budded virion is still immature as the [[Group-specific antigen|gag]] polyproteins still need to be cleaved into the actual matrix, capsid and nucleocapsid proteins. This cleavage is mediated by the also packaged viral protease and can be inhibited by [[antiretroviral drug]]s of the [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitor]] class. The various structural components then assemble to produce a mature HIV virion.<ref name=Gelderblom>{{cite book | author= Gelderblom HR | year = 1997 | title = HIV sequence compendium | chapter = Fine structure of HIV and SIV |chapterurl=http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HIV/COMPENDIUM/1997/partIII/Gelderblom.pdf  | editor = Los Alamos National Laboratory | edition = | pages = 31–44 | publisher = [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] }}</ref> Only mature virions are then able to infect another cell.

===Spread within the body===
HIV is now known to spread between CD4+ T cells by two parallel routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms.<ref name=Zhang>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang C, Zhou S, Groppelli E, Pellegrino P, Williams I, Borrow P, Chain BM, Jolly C | title = Hybrid Spreading Mechanisms and T Cell Activation Shape the Dynamics of HIV-1 Infection | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = e1004179 | year = 2015 | pmid = 25837979 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004179 }}</ref> In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter.<ref name="Zhang"/> HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread.

===Genetic variability===
{{Further|Subtypes of HIV}}
[[File:HIV-SIV-phylogenetic-tree straight.svg|thumb|left|The [[phylogenetic tree]] of the SIV and HIV]]
HIV differs from many viruses in that it has very high [[genetic variability]]. This diversity is a result of its fast [[HIV#Replication cycle|replication cycle]], with the generation of about 10<sup>10</sup> virions every day, coupled with a high [[mutation rate]] of approximately 3 x 10<sup>−5</sup> per nucleotide base per cycle of replication and [[Genetic recombination|recombinogenic]] properties of reverse transcriptase.<ref name=RobertsonDL>{{cite journal | vauthors = Robertson DL, Hahn BH, Sharp PM | title = Recombination in AIDS viruses | journal = J Mol Evol. | volume = 40 | issue = 3 | pages = 249–59 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7723052 | doi = 10.1007/BF00163230 }}</ref><ref name="Rambaut_2004">{{cite journal | vauthors = Rambaut A, Posada D, Crandall KA, Holmes EC | title = The causes and consequences of HIV evolution | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 52–61 | pages = 52–61 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14708016 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1246 | url = http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/downloadPaper.php?id=242 }}</ref><ref name="pmid17960579">{{cite journal | vauthors = Perelson AS, Ribeiro RM | title = Estimating drug efficacy and viral dynamic parameters: HIV and HCV | journal = Stat Med | volume = 27 | issue = 23 | pages = 4647–57 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 17960579 | doi = 10.1002/sim.3116 }}</ref>

This complex scenario leads to the generation of many variants of HIV in a single infected patient in the course of one day.<ref name=RobertsonDL/> This variability is compounded when a single cell is simultaneously infected by two or more different strains of HIV. When simultaneous infection occurs, the genome of progeny virions may be composed of RNA strands from two different strains. This hybrid virion then infects a new cell where it undergoes replication. As this happens, the reverse transcriptase, by jumping back and forth between the two different RNA templates, will generate a newly synthesized retroviral [[DNA sequence]] that is a recombinant between the two parental genomes.<ref name=RobertsonDL/> This recombination is most obvious when it occurs between subtypes.<ref name=RobertsonDL/>

The closely related [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) has evolved into many strains, classified by the natural host species. SIV strains of the [[African green monkey]] (SIVagm) and [[sooty mangabey]] (SIVsmm) are thought to have a long evolutionary history with their hosts.

Although IFA can be used to confirm infection in these ambiguous cases, this assay is not widely used.

Although much less commonly available, [[nucleic acid]] testing (e.g., viral RNA or proviral DNA amplification method) can also help diagnosis in certain situations.<ref name="CDC2001" /> In addition, a few tested specimens might provide inconclusive results because of a low quantity specimen.

The latest recommendations of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)|CDC]] show that HIV testing must start with an immunoassay combination test for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and p24 antigen. A negative result rules out HIV exposure, while a positive one must be followed by an HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation immunoassay to detect which is present. This gives rise to four possible scenarios:

* 1. HIV-1 (+) & HIV-2 (-): HIV-1 antibodies detected
* 2. HIV-1 (-) & HIV-2 (+): HIV-2 antibodies detected
* 3. HIV-1 (+) & HIV-2 (+): HIV antibodies detected
* 4. HIV-1 (-) or indeterminate & HIV-2 (-): [[Nucleic acid test]] must be carried out to detect the acute infection of HIV-1 or its absence.<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/testingHIValgorithmQuickRef.pdf</ref>

An updated algorithm published by the CDC in June 2014 recommends that diagnosis starts with the p24 antigen test. A negative result rules out infection, while a positive one must be followed by an HIV-1/2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. A positive differentiation test confirms diagnosis, while a negative or indeterminate result must be followed by nucleic acid test (NAT). A positive NAT result  confirms HIV-1 infection whereas a negative result rules out infection (false positive p24).<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2014/HIV-testing-Labs-Flowchart.pdf</ref>

{{Main|HIV/AIDS research}}
HIV/AIDS research includes all [[medical research]] that attempts to prevent, treat, or cure [[HIV/AIDS]], as well as fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV.

Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV/AIDS research. This research includes behavioral [[health interventions]], such as research into [[sex education]], and [[drug development]], such as research into [[microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases]], [[HIV vaccine]]s, and [[antiretroviral drug]]s. Other medical research areas include the topics of [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]], [[post-exposure prophylaxis]], [[circumcision and HIV]], and [[Biological clock (aging)|accelerated aging effects]].

===Origins===
Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are believed to have originated in non-human [[primate]]s in West-central Africa, and are believed to have transferred to humans (a process known as [[zoonosis]]) in the early 20th century.<ref name=Orgin2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Origins of HIV and the AIDS Pandemic | journal = Cold Spring Harbor perspectives in medicine | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = a006841 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22229120 | pmc = 3234451 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a006841 }}</ref><ref name=Faria2014>{{cite journal | vauthors = Faria NR, Rambaut A, Suchard MA, Baele G, Bedford T, Ward MJ, Tatem AJ, Sousa JD, Arinaminpathy N, Pépin J, Posada D, Peeters M, Pybus OG, Lemey P | title = The early spread and epidemic ignition of HIV-1 in human populations | journal = Science | volume = 346 | issue = 6205 | pages = 56–61 | year = 2014 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1126/science.1256739 }}</ref>

HIV-1 appears to have originated in southern [[Cameroon]] through the evolution of SIV(cpz), a [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] (SIV) that infects wild [[chimpanzee]]s (HIV-1 descends from the SIV(cpz) endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies ''[[Central chimpanzee|Pan troglodytes troglodytes]]'').<ref name="pmid9989410">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao F, Bailes E, Robertson DL, Chen Y, Rodenburg CM, Michael SF, Cummins LB, Arthur LO, Peeters M, Shaw GM, Sharp PM, Hahn BH | title = Origin of HIV-1 in the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes troglodytes | journal = Nature | volume = 397 | issue = 6718 | pages = 436–41 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9989410 | doi = 10.1038/17130 | bibcode = 1999Natur.397..436G }}</ref><ref name=Keele>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keele BF, Van Heuverswyn F, Li Y, Bailes E, Takehisa J, Santiago ML, Bibollet-Ruche F, Chen Y, Wain LV, Liegeois F, Loul S, Ngole EM, Bienvenue Y, Delaporte E, Brookfield JF, Sharp PM, Shaw GM, Peeters M, Hahn BH | title = Chimpanzee reservoirs of pandemic and nonpandemic HIV-1 | journal = Science | volume = 313 | issue = 5786 | pages = 523–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16728595 | pmc = 2442710 | doi = 10.1126/science.1126531 | bibcode = 2006Sci...313..523K }}</ref> The closest relative of HIV-2 is SIV (smm), a virus of the [[sooty mangabey]] (''Cercocebus atys atys''), an [[Old World monkey]] living in litoral West Africa (from southern [[Senegal]] to western [[Ivory Coast|Côte d'Ivoire]]).<ref name=Reeves /> [[New World monkey]]s such as the [[Night monkey|owl monkey]] are resistant to HIV-1 infection, possibly because of a [[fusion gene|genomic fusion]] of two viral resistance genes.<ref name=Goodier>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodier JL, Kazazian HH | title = Retrotransposons revisited: the restraint and rehabilitation of parasites | journal = Cell | volume = 135 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–35 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18854152 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.022 }}</ref>
