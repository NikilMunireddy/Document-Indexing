Franklin began her career singing [[gospel music|gospel]] at her father, [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] [[C. L. Franklin]]'s [[New Bethel Baptist Church (Detroit, Michigan)|church]] as a child. In 1960, at the age of 18, Franklin embarked on a [[secular music|secular career]], recording for [[Columbia Records]] but only achieving modest success. Following her signing to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967, Franklin achieved commercial acclaim and success with songs such as "[[Respect (song)#Aretha Franklin version 2|Respect]]", "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman]]" and "[[Think (Aretha Franklin song)|Think]]". These hits and more helped her to gain the title [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|The Queen of Soul]] by the end of the [[1960s in music|1960s decade]].

Franklin eventually recorded a total of 112 charted singles on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', including 77 [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] entries, 17 top ten [[Billboard Hot 100|pop singles]], 100 [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] entries and twenty number-one [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B singles]], becoming the most charted female artist in the chart's history. Franklin also recorded acclaimed albums such as ''[[I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You]]'', ''[[Lady Soul]]'', ''[[Young, Gifted & Black]]'' and ''[[Amazing Grace (Aretha Franklin album)|Amazing Grace]]'' before experiencing problems with her record company by the mid-[[1970s in music|1970s]]. After her father was shot in 1979, Franklin left Atlantic and signed with [[Arista Records]], finding success with her part in the film, ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' and with the albums, ''[[Jump to It]]'' and ''[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]]''. In 1998, Franklin won international acclaim for singing the opera aria, "[[Nessun Dorma]]", at the [[Grammy Awards of 1998|Grammys of that year]] replacing [[Luciano Pavarotti]]. Later that same year, she scored her final Top 40 recording with "[[A Rose Is Still a Rose (song)|A Rose Is Still a Rose]]". Franklin's other popular and well known hits include, "[[Rock Steady (Aretha Franklin song)|Rock Steady]]", "[[Something He Can Feel]]" (from [[Sparkle (Aretha Franklin album)|the soundtrack]] to [[Sparkle (1976 film)|the 1976 film ''Sparkle'']]), "[[Jump to It (song)|Jump to It]]", "[[Freeway of Love]]", "[[Who's Zoomin' Who]]", "[[Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves]]", "[[I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)]]" (with [[George Michael]]), "[[It Isn't, It Wasn't, It Ain't Never Gonna Be]]" (with [[Whitney Houston]]) and a remake of [[The Rolling Stones]] song "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]".

Aretha Louise Franklin was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the daughter of [[Barbara Siggers Franklin|Barbara (née Siggers)]] and [[C. L. Franklin|Clarence LaVaughn Franklin]]. Her father, who went by the nickname, "C. L.", was an itinerant preacher originally from [[Shelby, Mississippi]], while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist.{{sfn|Bego|2010|p=11}} Alongside Franklin, her parents had three other children while both C. L. and Barbara had children from outside their marriage. The family relocated to [[Buffalo, New York]] when Franklin was two. Before her fifth birthday, C. L. Franklin permanently relocated the family to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] where he took over the pastorship of [[New Bethel Baptist Church (Detroit, Michigan)]]. Franklin's parents had a troubled marriage due to stories of C. L. Franklin's [[philandering]] and in 1948, they separated, with Barbara relocating back to Buffalo with her son, Vaughn, from a previous relationship.

Contrary to popular notion, Franklin's mother did not [[child abandonment|abandon]] her children; not only would Franklin recall seeing her mother in Buffalo during the summer, Barbara also frequently visited her children in Detroit.{{sfn|McAvoy|2002|pp=19-20}} Franklin's mother died on March 7, 1952, before Franklin's tenth birthday. Several women, including Franklin's grandmother Rachel, and [[Mahalia Jackson]] took turns helping with the children at the Franklin home.{{sfn|McAvoy|2002|p=22}} During this time, Franklin learned how to play piano by ear.{{sfn|McAvoy|2002|pp=20-21}} Franklin's father's emotionally driven sermons resulted in him being known as the man with the "million-dollar voice" and earning thousands of dollars for sermons in various churches across the country.{{sfn|Dobkin|2006|p=48}}{{sfn|Feiler|2009|p=248}} Franklin's celebrity led to his home being visited by various celebrities including gospel musicians [[Clara Ward]], [[James Cleveland]] and early [[The Caravans|Caravans]] members [[Albertina Walker]] and [[Inez Andrews]] as well as [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Jackie Wilson]] and [[Sam Cooke]].<ref>{{cite news|author= |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-19/entertainment/ct-ent-1220-inez-andrews-obit-20121219_1_albertina-walker-gospel-inez-andrews |title=Inez Andrews: A towering gospel artist - Chicago Tribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=2012-12-19 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/arts/music/inez-andrews-gospel-singer-dies-at-83.html?_r=0|title=Inez Andrews, Gospel Singer, Dies at 83|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2014-03-20|first=Dennis|last=Hevesi|date=December 21, 2012}}</ref>

==Music career==

===Beginnings===
Just after her mother's death, Franklin began singing solos at New Bethel, debuting with the hymn, "Jesus, Be a Fence Around Me".{{sfn|McAvoy|2002|p=22}}<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/5151565-421/roots--of-soul.html|title=Aretha Franklin's roots of soul|author=Dave Hoekstra|date=12 May 2011|publisher=''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> Four years later, when Franklin was 14, her father began [[career management|managing]] her, bringing her on the road with him during his so-called "gospel caravan" tours for her to perform in various churches.<ref name="Jillian Carool">{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Jillian|title=Aretha Franklin|year=2004|publisher=Raintree|location=Chicago|isbn=0-7398-7029-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nhDFoq_iQEC&pg=PA15}}</ref> He helped his daughter get signed to her first recording deal with J.V.B. Records, where her first album, ''[[Songs of Faith (Aretha Franklin album)|Songs of Faith]]'', was issued in 1956. Two singles were released to gospel radio stations including "Never Grow Old" and "[[Precious Lord, Take My Hand]]". Franklin sometimes traveled with [[The Caravans]] and [[The Soul Stirrers]] during this time and developed a crush on Sam Cooke, who was then singing with the Soul Stirrers before his secular career.

After turning 18, Franklin confided to her father that she aspired to follow Sam Cooke to record pop music. Serving as her manager, C. L. agreed to the move and helped to produce a two-song demo that soon was brought to the attention of [[Columbia Records]], who agreed to sign her in 1960. Franklin was signed as a "five-percent artist".{{sfn|Ebony|1964|p=88}} During this period, Franklin would be coached by choreographer [[Cholly Atkins]] to prepare for her pop performances. Before signing with Columbia, Sam Cooke tried to persuade Franklin's father to have his label, [[RCA Records|RCA]] sign Franklin. He had also been courted by local record label owner [[Berry Gordy]] to sign Franklin and her elder sister [[Erma Franklin|Erma]] to his [[Motown Records|Tamla]] label. Franklin's father felt the label was not established enough yet. Franklin's first Columbia single, "[[Today I Sing the Blues]]",<ref name=pc52/> was issued in September 1960 and later reached the top ten of the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm & Blues Sellers]] chart.

===Initial success===
[[File:Aretha Franklin.png|thumb|Franklin, 1967]]
In [[1961 in music|January 1961]], Columbia issued Franklin's first secular album, ''[[Aretha: With The Ray Bryant Combo]]''. The album featured her first single to chart the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, "[[Won't Be Long (Aretha Franklin song)|Won't Be Long]]", which also peaked at number 7 on the R&B chart. Mostly produced by [[Clyde Otis]], Franklin's Columbia recordings saw her recording in diverse genres such as [[standard (song)|standards]], [[vocal jazz]], [[blues]], [[doo-wop]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. Before the year was out, Franklin scored her first top 40 single with her rendition of the standard, "[[Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody]]", which also included the R&B hit, "[[Operation Heartbreak]]", on its b-side. "Rock-a-Bye" became her first international hit, reaching the top 40 in Australia and Canada. By the end of 1961, Franklin was named as a "new-star female vocalist" in ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Ebony|1964|p=85}} In 1962, Columbia issued two more albums, ''[[The Electrifying Aretha Franklin]]'' and ''[[The Tender, the Moving, the Swinging Aretha Franklin]]'', the latter of which charted number 69 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard Pop LPs]] chart.

By 1964, Franklin began recording more pop music, reaching the top ten on the R&B chart with the ballad, "Runnin' Out of Fools" in early 1965. She had two R&B charted singles in 1965 and 1966 with the songs "One Step Ahead" and "Cry Like a Baby" while also reaching the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Easy Listening]] charts with the ballads "[[You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)|You Made Me Love You]]" and "(No, No) I'm Losing You". By the mid-1960s, Franklin was netting $100,000 from countless performances in nightclubs and theaters.{{sfn|Ebony|1964|p=85}} Also during that period, Franklin appeared on rock and roll shows such as ''[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]'' and ''[[Shindig!]]''. However, it was argued that Franklin's potential was neglected at the label. Columbia executive [[John H. Hammond]] later said he felt Columbia did not understand Franklin's early gospel background and failed to bring that aspect out further during her Columbia period.<ref name=pc52>{{Gilliland|http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 – The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

===Commercial success===
In January 1967, choosing not to renew her Columbia contract after six years with the company, Franklin signed to Atlantic Records. That month, she  traveled to [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]] to record at [[FAME Studios]] to record the song, "[[I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)]]" in front of the musicians of the famed [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]].<ref name=pc52/> The song was later issued that February and shot up to number-one on the R&B chart, while also peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Franklin her first top ten pop single. The song's b-side, "[[Do Right Woman, Do Right Man]]", reached the R&B top 40, peaking at number 37. In April, Atlantic issued her frenetic version of [[Otis Redding]]'s "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]", which shot to number-one on both the R&B and pop charts and later became her [[signature song]] and was later hailed as a [[American Civil Rights Movement|civil rights]] and [[feminist movement|feminist]] anthem.<ref name=pc52/>

Franklin's debut Atlantic album, ''[[I Never Loved a Man the Way I Love You]]'', also became commercially successful, later going gold. Franklin scored two more top ten singles in 1967 including "[[Baby I Love You (Aretha Franklin song)|Baby I Love You]]" and "[[(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman]]". Franklin's rapport with producer [[Jerry Wexler]] helped in the creation of the majority of Franklin's peak recordings with Atlantic. In 1968, she issued the top-selling albums, ''[[Lady Soul]]'' and ''[[Aretha Now]]'', which included some of Franklin's most popular hit singles including "[[Chain of Fools]]", "[[Ain't No Way]]", "[[Think (Aretha Franklin song)|Think]]" and "[[I Say a Little Prayer]]". In February 1968, Franklin earned the first two of her Grammys including the debut category for [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]].<ref name=8grammies>[[Natalie Cole]] broke Franklin's "Best Female R&B Vocal Performance" winning streak with her 1975 single "This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)" (which, ironically, was originally offered to Franklin).</ref> On February 16, 1968, Franklin was honored with a day in her honor and was greeted by longtime friend [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] who gave her the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference|SCLC]] Drum Beat Award for Musicians just two months before his death.{{sfn|Dobkin|2006|p=5}}{{sfn|Whitaker|2011|p=315}}{{sfn|Bego|2010|p=107}} In June 1968, she appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.<ref name="TIME magazine - 28Jun1968 - cover - Aretha Franklin">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19680628,00.html|title=TIME Magazine Cover:  Aretha Franklin|date=June 28, 1968 |work=[[Time Magazine|Time]]|accessdate=September 30, 2011}}</ref>

Franklin's success expanded during the early 1970s in which she recorded top ten singles such as "[[Spanish Harlem (song)|Spanish Harlem]]", "[[Rock Steady (Aretha Franklin song)|Rock Steady]]" and "[[Day Dreaming (Aretha Franklin song)|Day Dreaming]]" as well as the acclaimed albums, ''[[Spirit in the Dark]]'', ''[[Young, Gifted & Black]]'' and her gospel album, ''[[Amazing Grace (Aretha Franklin album)|Amazing Grace]]'', which sold over two million copies. In 1971, Franklin became the first R&B performer to headline [[Fillmore West]], later recording the live album, ''[[Aretha Live at Fillmore West]]''.<ref name="Bill Graham">{{cite web|title=Aretha Franklin songs |url=http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/aretha-franklin/songs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120120044822/http://www.wolfgangsvault.com/aretha-franklin/songs |archivedate=January 20, 2012 }}

Despite the success of the single, "[[Angel (Aretha Franklin song)|Angel]]", the album bombed upon its release in 1973. Franklin continued having R&B success with songs such as "[[Until You Come Back to Me (That's What I'm Gonna Do)|Until You Come Back to Me]]" and "[[I'm in Love (Bobby Womack song)|I'm in Love]]" but by 1975, her albums and songs were failing to become a success. After [[Jerry Wexler]] left Atlantic for [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1976, Franklin worked on the [[Sparkle (Aretha Franklin album)|soundtrack]] to the film, "[[Sparkle (1976 film)|Sparkle]]", with [[Curtis Mayfield]]. The album yielded Franklin's final top 40 hit of the decade, "[[Something He Can Feel]]", which also peaked at number-one on the R&B chart. Franklin's follow-up albums for Atlantic including ''[[Sweet Passion]]'', ''[[Almighty Fire]]'' and ''[[La Diva (Aretha Franklin album)|La Diva]]'' bombed on the charts and in 1979, Franklin opted to leave the company.

Franklin also made an acclaimed guest role as a waitress in the comedy musical, ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. Franklin's first Arista album, ''[[Aretha (1980 album)|Aretha]]'', featured the #3 R&B hit, "United Together" and her Grammy-nominated cover of Otis Redding's "[[I Can't Turn You Loose]]". The follow-up, 1981's ''[[Love All the Hurt Away]]'', included her famed duet of the title track with [[George Benson]] while the album also included her Grammy-winning cover of [[Sam & Dave]]'s "[[Hold On, I'm A Comin'|Hold On, I'm Comin']]". Franklin returned to the Gold standard– for the first time in seven years– with the album, ''[[Jump to It]]''.  Its [[Jump to It (song)|title track]] was her first top 40 single on the pop charts in six years.

In 1985, inspired by her desire to have a "younger sound" in her music, her fifth Arista album, ''[[Who's Zoomin' Who?]]'', became her first album to be certified [[List of music recording certifications|platinum]], after selling well over a million copies, thanks to the hits, "[[Freeway of Love]]", the title track and "[[Sisters Are Doing It for Themselves]]".<ref>[[Rolling Stone]] magazine, "Aretha Franklin's New Wave of Pop" by Eliza Graham, page 11.</ref> The following year's ''[[Aretha (1986 album)|Aretha]]'' album nearly matched this success with the hit singles "[[Jumpin' Jack Flash]]", "[[Jimmy Lee (song)|Jimmy Lee]]" and "[[I Knew You Were Waiting for Me]]", her international number-one duet with [[George Michael]]. During that period, Franklin provided vocals to the theme songs of the shows, ''[[A Different World]]'' and ''Together''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1986-07-18/features/8602120160_1_abc-tv-aretha-franklin-brock-walsh|title=Writer's Ballad Tapped For Abc-tv Fall Theme|author=Patrick Goldstein|date=18 July 1986|publisher=''[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]''|accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref> In 1987, she issued her third gospel album, ''[[One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism]]'', which was recorded at her late father's New Bethel church, followed by ''Through the Storm'' in 1989. Franklin's 1991 album, ''What You See is What You Sweat'', flopped on the charts. Franklin returned to the charts in 1993 with the dance song "A Deeper Love" and returned to the top 40 with the song "Willing to Forgive" in 1994.

In 1998, Franklin returned to the top 40 with the [[Lauryn Hill]]-produced song, "[[A Rose Is Still a Rose (song)|A Rose Is Still a Rose]]", later issuing the [[A Rose Is Still a Rose|album of the same name]], which went gold. That same year, Franklin earned international acclaim for her performance of "[[Nessun Dorma]]" at the [[Grammy Awards of 1998|Grammy Awards]]. Her final Arista album, ''[[So Damn Happy (Aretha Franklin album)|So Damn Happy]]'', was released in 2003 and featured the Grammy-winning song, "Wonderful". In 2004, Franklin announced that she was leaving Arista after over 20 years with the label. To complete her Arista obligations, Franklin issued the duets compilation album, ''[[Jewels in the Crown: All-Star Duets with the Queen]]'', in 2007. The following year, she issued the holiday album, ''[[This Christmas, Aretha]]'', on DMI Records.

==Music style and image==
Franklin has often been described as a great singer and musician due to "vocal flexibility, interpretive intelligence, skillful piano-playing, her ear, her experience."{{sfn|Dobkin|2006|p=8}} Franklin's voice has been described as being a "powerful mezzo-soprano voice" and has been praised for her arrangements and interpretations of other artists' hit songs.{{sfn|Whitaker|2011|p=312}} Of describing Franklin's voice as a youngster on her first album, ''[[Songs of Faith (Aretha Franklin album)|Songs of Faith]]'', released when she was just fourteen, [[Jerry Wexler]] explained that Franklin's voice "was not that of a child but rather of an ecstatic [[hierophant]]."{{sfn|McMahon|2000|p=373}} Franklin's image went through rapid changes throughout her career. During the 1960s, Franklin was known for wearing bouffant hairdos and extravagant dresses that were sometimes embellished with either mink fur or feathers. In the 1970s, embracing her roots, Franklin briefly wore an Afro and the Afrocentric styled clothing admired by her peers. In the mid-1970s, after dropping weight, Franklin began wearing more fitted attire. By the 1980s, she had settled on wearing evening gowns and extravagant dresses.

After being raised in Detroit, Franklin relocated to [[New York City]] in the 1960s, where she lived until moving to [[Los Angeles]] in the mid-1970s. She eventually settled in [[Encino, Los Angeles]] where she lived until 1982. She then returned to the Detroit suburb of [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]] to be close to her ailing father and siblings. Franklin maintains a residence there to this day. Following an incident in 1984, she has cited a fear of flying that has prevented her from traveling overseas; she has performed only in North America since then.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXI72Wa65LU Interview], The Wendy Williams Show, March 2011, YouTube.com, at Minute 2:00, retrieved at 16.

By marrying Turman, Franklin became stepmother of Turman's three children from a previous marriage. Franklin and Turman separated in 1982 after Franklin returned to Michigan from California, and they divorced in 1984.

Following Franklin's divorce from Ted White, her brother Cecil became her manager, and maintained that position until his death from lung cancer on December 26, 1989. Sister Carolyn died the previous year in April 1988 from breast cancer, while eldest sister Erma passed from throat cancer in September 2002. Franklin's half-brother Vaughn died two months after Erma in late 2002. Half-sister Carl Kelley (née Jennings; born 1940) is still alive at 74. Kelley is C. L.
