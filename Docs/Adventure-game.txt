An '''adventure game''' is a [[video game]] in which the player assumes the role of protagonist in an interactive story driven by exploration and [[puzzle|puzzle-solving]].<ref name="rollings43"/> The [[Video game genres|genre]]'s focus on story allows it to draw heavily from other narrative-based media, literature and film, encompassing a wide variety of literary genres. Many adventure games ([[List of text-based computer games|text]] and [[Comparison of graphic adventure games|graphic]]) are designed for a single player, since this emphasis on story and character makes multi-player design difficult.<ref name="perspectives"/> ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' is identified as the first such adventure game, first released in 1976, while other notable adventure game series include ''[[Zork]]'', ''[[King's Quest]]'', ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'', and ''[[Myst]]''.

Initial adventure games developed in the 1970s and early 1980s were text-based, using text parsers to translate the player's input into commands. As personal computers became more powerful with the ability to show graphics, the graphic adventure game format became popular, initially by augmenting player's text commands with graphics, but soon moving towards [[point and click]] interfaces. Further computer advancements led to adventure games with more immersive graphics using real-time or pre-rendered three-dimensional scenes or [[full-motion video]] taken from the first- or third-person perspective.

For markets in the Western hemisphere, the genre's popularity peaked during the late 1980s to mid-1990s when many considered it to be among the most technically advanced genres, but had become a niche genre in the early 2000s due to the popularity of [[first-person shooters]] and became difficult to find publishers to support such ventures. Since then, a resurgence in the genre has occurred spurred on by success of [[independent video game development]], particularly from [[crowdfunding]] efforts, the wide availability of [[digital distribution]] enabling episodic approaches, and the proliferation of new gaming platforms including portable consoles and mobile devices.

Within the Asian markets, adventure games continue to be popular in the form of [[visual novel]]s, which make up nearly 70% of [[Personal computer game|PC games]] released in Japan.<ref name=ANN/> The Asian markets have also found markets for adventure games for portable and mobile gaming devices.

The term "Adventure game" originated from the 1970s text computer game ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'', or as it was often referred to simply as ''Adventure'',<ref name=rollings443/><ref name=encyclopedia/> which pioneered a style of [[gameplay]] that was widely imitated and became a genre in its own right. The [[Video game genres|video game genre]] is therefore defined by its gameplay, unlike the [[adventure (genre)|literary genre]], which is defined by the subject it addresses, the activity of adventure.<ref name="rollings474–476"/>

Essential elements of the genre include storytelling, exploration, and puzzle solving.<ref name="rollings474–476"/> Adventure games have been described as puzzles embedded in a narrative framework,<ref name=agdefinition/> where games involve "narrative content that a player unlocks piece by piece over time".<ref name=rules-385/> While the puzzles that players encounter through the story can be arbitrary, those that do not pull the player out of the narrative are considered examples of good design.<ref name="Todd105"/>

===Relationship to other genres===
Combat and action challenges are limited or absent in adventure games,<ref name="rollings443–444"/> thus distinguishing them from [[action game]]s.<ref name=agdefinition/> In the book ''[[Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams on Game Design]]'', the authors state that "this [reduced emphasis on combat] doesn't mean that there is no conflict in adventure games ... only that combat is not the primary activity."<ref name=rollings443/> Some adventure games will include a [[minigame]] from another [[video game genre]], which are not always appreciated by adventure game purists.<ref name="rollings446–447" /> Hybrid [[action-adventure game]]s blend [[action game|action]] and adventure games throughout the game experience, incorporating more physical challenges than pure adventure games and at a faster pace.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://adventuregamers.com/article/id,903/ | title=Insecticide, Part 1 review | publisher=[[Adventure Gamers]] | accessdate=5 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080811024218/http://www.adventuregamers.com/article/id,903/| archivedate= 11 August 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> This definition is hard to apply, however, with some debate among designers about which games are [[action game]]s and which involve enough non-physical challenges to be considered action-adventures.<ref name="fundamentals"/>

Adventure games are also distinct from [[role-playing video game]]s that involve action, team-building, and points management.<ref name=agdefinition /> Adventure games lack the numeric rules or relationships seen in role-playing games, and seldom have an internal economy.<ref name="rollings239-240"/> These games lack any skill system, combat, or "an opponent to be defeated through strategy and tactics."<ref name=rollings443/> However, some hybrid games exist here, where role-playing games with strong narrative and puzzle elements are considered RPG-adventures.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/heros-quest-so-you-want-to-be-a-hero | title=Hero's Quest: So You Want To Be A Hero | publisher=[[MobyGames]] | accessdate=5 August 2008}}</ref> Finally, adventure games are classified separately from [[puzzle video game]]s.<ref name=agdefinition /> Although an adventure game may involve puzzle-solving, they typically involve a player-controlled avatar in an interactive story.<ref name="fundamentals"/>

==Game design==

===Puzzle-solving===
Adventure games contain a variety of [[Puzzle game|puzzles]], decoding messages, finding and using items, opening locked doors, or finding and exploring new locations.<ref name="rollings460–461"/><ref name="Chandler119"/> Solving a puzzle will unlock access to new areas in the game world, and reveal more of the game story.<ref name=Bergman315/> Logic puzzles, where mechanical devices are designed with abstract interfaces to test a player's deductive reasoning skills, are common.<ref name="Adams444–445"/>

Some puzzles are criticized for the obscurity of their solutions, for example, the combination of a [[clothes line]], [[clamp (tool)|clamp]], and deflated [[rubber duck]] used to gather a key stuck between the subway tracks in ''[[The Longest Journey]]'', which exists outside of the game's narrative and serves only as an obstacle to the player.<ref name="understanding"/> Others have been criticized for requiring players to blindly guess, either by clicking on the right pixel, or by guessing the right verb in games that use a text interface.<ref name=Jenkins443-444/> Games that require players to navigate mazes have also become less popular, although the earliest text-adventure games usually required players to draw a map if they wanted to navigate the abstract space.<ref name="rollings56"/>

===Gathering and using items===
Many adventure games make use of an inventory management screen as a distinct gameplay mode.<ref name="rollings460–461"/> Players are only able to pick up some objects in the game, so the player usually knows that only objects that can be picked up are important.<ref name="fundamentals"/> Because it can be difficult for a player to know if they missed an important [[Item (gaming)|item]], they will often scour every scene for items. For games that utilize a [[point and click]] device, players will sometimes engage in a systematic search known as a pixel hunt. Games try to avoid this by highlighting the item, or by snapping the player's cursor to the item.<ref name="IGN_adventure">{{cite web| url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/849/849843p1.html | title = State of the Genre: Adventure Game |author1=Charles Onyett |author2=Steve Butts | date=February 2008 | publisher = IGN }}</ref>

Many puzzles in these games involve gathering and using items from their inventory.<ref name="Chandler119" /> Players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply real-world extrinsic knowledge about objects in unexpected ways. For example, by putting a deflated inner tube on a cactus to create a slingshot, which requires a player to realize that an inner tube is stretchy.<ref name="fundamentals"/> They may need to carry items in their inventory for a long duration before they prove useful,<ref>{{citation|title = "Sam and Max Review" in GameAxis Unwired – July 2007 | author = Wayne Santos | publisher = GameAxis Unwired | date = July 2007 }}</ref> and thus it is normal for adventure games to test a player's memory where a challenge can only be overcome by recalling a piece of information from earlier in the game.<ref name="fundamentals"/> There is seldom any time pressure for these puzzles, focusing more on the player's ability to reason than on quick-thinking.<ref name="Bergman311-315" />

===Story, setting, and themes===
Adventure games are single-player experiences that are largely story-driven.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3393/designers_notebook_its_time_to_.php | author = Ernest W. Adams | title = Designer's Notebook: It's Time To Bring Back Adventure Games | publisher = Gamasutra | date = 9 November 1999 }}</ref> More than any other genre, adventure games depend upon their story and setting to create a compelling single-player experience.<ref name="fundamentals"/> They are typically set in an [[immersive environment]], often a [[fantasy world]],<ref name=encyclopedia /><ref name="Gibson276"/> and try to vary the setting from chapter to chapter to add novelty and interest to the experience.<ref name="fundamentals"/> Comedy is a common theme, and games often script comedic responses when players attempt actions or combinations that are "ridiculous or impossible".{{sfn|Rollings|Adams|2003|p=444}}

Since adventure games are driven by storytelling, character development usually follows literary conventions of personal and emotional growth, rather than new powers or abilities that affect gameplay.<ref name="fundamentals"/> The player often embarks upon a [[quest]],<ref name=pedersen36/> or is required to unravel a mystery or situation about which little is known.<ref name=alessi /> These types of mysterious stories allow designers to get around what [[Ernest W. Adams]] calls the "Problem of Amnesia", where the player controls the protagonist but must start the game without their knowledge and experience.<ref name="problems">{{harvnb|Adams|1999}}</ref> Story-events typically unfold as the player completes new challenges or puzzles, but in order to make such storytelling less mechanical new elements in the story may also be triggered by player movement.<ref name="fundamentals"/>

===Dialogue and conversation trees===
{{Further|Dialog tree}}

Adventure games have strong storylines with significant dialog, and sometimes make effective use of recorded dialog or narration from voice actors.<ref name="fundamentals"/> This genre of game is known for representing dialog as a [[dialog tree|conversation tree]].<ref name=Scholder167/> Players are able to engage a [[non-player character]] by choosing a line of pre-written dialog from a menu, which triggers a response from the game character.<ref name="rollings446–447"/> These conversations are often designed as a [[tree structure]], with players deciding between each branch of dialog to pursue.<ref name="rollings469"/> However, there are always a finite number of branches to pursue, and some adventure games devolve into selecting each option one-by-one.<ref name="Rouse230"/> Conversing with characters can reveal clues about how to solve puzzles, including hints about what that character would want before they will cooperate with the player.<ref name="fundamentals"/> Other conversations will have far-reaching consequences, deciding to disclose a valuable secret that has been entrusted to the player.<ref name="fundamentals"/> Characters may also be convinced to reveal their own secrets, either through conversation or by giving them something that will benefit them.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===Goals, success and failure===
The primary goal in adventure games is the completion of the assigned quest.<ref name=pedersen16/> Early adventure games often had [[score (game)|high scores]] and some, ''[[Zork]]'', also assigned the player a rank, a text description based on their score.{{sfn|Montfort|2003|p=136}} High scores provide the player with a secondary goal,<ref name=pedersen16/> and serve as an indicator of progression.{{sfn|Montfort|2003|p=136}} While high scores are now less common, external reward systems, [[Xbox Live]]'s Achievements perform a similar role.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://xbox.about.com/od/xbox360faqs/f/achievementsfaq.htm|title=What Are Xbox Achievements?|website=About.com Tech|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref>

The primary failure condition in adventure games, inherited from more action-oriented games, is player death. Without the clearly identified enemies of other genres, its inclusion in adventure games is controversial, and many developers now either avoid it or take extra steps to foreshadow death.<ref name="rollings459–460"/> Some early adventure games trapped the players in [[Unwinnable|unwinnable situations]] without ending the game. [[Infocom]]'s text adventure ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' has been criticized for a scenario where failing to pick up a pile of junk mail at the beginning of the game prevented the player, much later, from completing the game.<ref name="twinkie">{{cite web| last=Adams |first=Ernest | title=Designer's Notebook: Bad Game Designer, No Twinkie! | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3260/designers_notebook_bad_game_.php | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] | accessdate=10 June 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100510113532/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3260/designers_notebook_bad_game_.php| archivedate= 10 May 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The adventure games developed by LucasArts purposely avoided creating a dead-end situation for the player due to the negative reactions to such situations.<ref name="usgamer lucasarts gateway">{{Cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-gateway-guide-to-lucasarts-adventure-games | title = The Gateway Guide to LucasArts Adventure Games | first = Bob | last = Mackey | date = 21 January 2015 | accessdate = 10 November 2015 | work = [[USGamer]] }}</ref>

==Subgenres==

===Text adventures and Interactive Fiction===
{{anchor|Text adventure}}
{{Main|Interactive fiction}}
[[File:Zork photo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A computer terminal running ''[[Zork]]'' (1977), one of the first commercially successful text adventure games.]]
Text adventures convey the game's story through passages of text, revealed to the player in response to typed instructions.<ref name="rollings155-156"/> Early text adventures, ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'', "Hugo's House of Horrors" and Scott Adams' games, used a simple [[verb]]-[[noun]] parser to interpret these instructions, allowing the player to interact with objects at a basic level, for example by typing "get key".<ref name=Salter29/> Later text adventures, and modern interactive fiction, use [[natural language processing]] to enable more complex player commands like "take the key from the desk". Notable examples of advanced text adventures include most games developed by [[Infocom]], including ''[[Zork]]'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.<ref name="rollings155-156"/> With the onset of graphic adventures, the text adventure fell to the wayside, though the medium remains popular as a means of writing [[Interactive Fiction]] (IF), which tend to be focused more on the narrative through player exploration and discovery rather than puzzle solving. Interactive fiction may include puzzles, but these tend to be incorporated as part of the narrative in comparison to being specifically added as gameplay that must be solved to continue within adventure games.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.1up.com/features/choose-adventure | title = Choose Your Own Adventure | first = Laura | last = Crigger | date = 20 June 2008 | accessdate = 23 February 2016 | work = [[1UP.com]] }}</ref>

===Graphic adventure===
Graphic adventures are adventure games that use graphics to convey the environment to the player. Games under the graphic adventure banner may have a variety of input types, from text parsers to touch screen interfaces.<ref name="rollings155-156"/> Graphic adventure games will vary in how they present the avatar. Some games will utilize a first-person or third-person perspective where the camera follows the player's movements, whereas many adventure games use drawn or pre-rendered backgrounds, or a context-sensitive camera that is positioned to show off each location to the best effect.<ref name="rollings451"/>

====Point-and-click adventure games====
[[File:The Whispered World screenshot 006.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Whispered World]]'' (2009) is an example of a context-based point-and-click adventure game using high-definition graphics and animation.]]
Point-and-click adventure games are those where the player typically controls their character through a [[point-and-click]] interface using a computer mouse or similar pointing device, though additional control schemes may also be available.<ref name=Salter40/> The player clicks to move their character around, interact with non-player characters, often initiating [[conversation tree]]s with them, examine objects in the game's settings or with their character's item inventory. Many point-and-click games would include a list of on-screen verbs to describe specific actions in the manner of a text adventure, but newer games have used more context-sensitive user interface elements to reduce or eliminate this approach. Often, these games come down to collecting items for the character's inventory, and figuring where is the right time to use that item; the player would need to use clues from the visual elements of the game, descriptions of the various items, and dialog from other characters to figure this out. Later games developed by [[Sierra Online]] including the ''[[King's Quest (series)|King's Quest]]'' games, and nearly all of the [[LucasArts adventure games]], are point-and-click based games.

====Escape the room games====
{{main|Escape the room}}
[[Escape the room]] games are a further specialization of point-and-click adventure games; these games are typically short and confined to a small space to explore, with almost no interaction with non-player characters. Most games of this type require the player to figure out how to escape a room using the limited resources within it and through the solving of logic puzzles. Other variants include games that require the player to manipulate a complex object to achieve a certain end in the fashion of a [[puzzle box]]. These games are often delivered in [[Adobe Flash]] format and are also popular on mobile devices. Examples of the subgenre include the ''[[Submachine (series)|Submachine]]''-series, ''[[MOTAS]] (Mystery of Time and Space)'' and ''[[The Room (2012 video game)|The Room]]''.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/185397/Could_The_Rooms_success_predict_a_new_trend.php | title = Could The Room's success predict a new trend? | work = [[Gamasutra]] | first = Leigh | last = Alexander | date = 23 January 2013 | accessdate = 10 November 2015 }}</ref>

====Puzzle adventure games====
Puzzle adventure games are adventure games that put a strong emphasis on logic puzzles. They typically emphasize self-contained puzzle challenges with logic puzzle toys or games. Completing each puzzle opens more of the game's world to explore, additional puzzles to solve, and can expand on the game's story.<ref name="Rouse233"/> There are often few to none [[non-playable character]]s in such games, and lack the type of inventory puzzles that typical point-and-click adventure games have. Puzzle adventure games were popularized by ''[[Myst]]'' and ''[[The 7th Guest]]''. These both used mixed media consisting of pre-rendered images and movie clips,<ref name="Rouse208"/> but since then, puzzle adventure games have taken advantage of modern game engines to present the games in full 3D settings, such as ''[[The Talos Principle]]''. ''Myst'' itself has been recreated in such a fashion in the title ''realMyst''. Other puzzle adventure games are casual adventure games made up series of puzzles used to explore and progress the story, exemplified by ''[[The Witness (2016 video game)|The Witness]]'' and the  ''[[Professor Layton]]'' series of games.

====Exploration games====
[[File:The Stanley Parable - Screenshot 03.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Stanley Parable]]'' (2014) is a first-person exploration game set in an office building.]]
Exploration games are narrative-focused adventures that allow players to experience their story through exploration and discovery. They are story-focused and feature fewer puzzles or even no puzzles at all. They allow players to roam around an environment freely and often tell their story through discovering elements like books, journals, or clues rather than through dialog and cutscenes as in more traditional adventure games. As puzzles are de-emphasized, story and atmosphere are placed at the forefront. The lack of actions had lead to these types of games being referred to by the sometimes derogatory term '''walking simulators'''. Some examples of exploration games include ''[[Gone Home]]'', ''[[Dear Esther]]'', ''[[The Stanley Parable]]'', ''[[Jazzpunk]]'', and ''[[Thirty Flights of Loving]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-gateway-guide-to-walking-simulators | title = The Gateway Guide to Walking Simulators | publisher = [[US Gamer]] | date = 22 July 2015 | accessdate = 27 July 2015 | first = Bob | last = Mackey }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/19/seven-game-design-trends-e3-2015 | title = Robots, dogs and the apocalypse: seven game design trends from E3 2015 | first1 = Simon |last1 = Parkin | first2= Keith | last2= Stuart | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 17 June 2015 | accessdate = 27 July 2015 }}</ref>

===Visual novel===
[[File:Wikipe-tan_visual_novel_(Ren%27Py).png|thumb|right|alt=A cartoon girl in a sailor outfit stands in front of a photograph of a green chalkboard. The lower-third screen is covered by a translucent dialogue box.|A common layout for a [[visual novel]] game]]
{{Main|Visual novel}}
A {{Nihongo|visual novel|ビジュアルノベル|bijuaru noberu}} is a hybrid of text and graphical adventure games, typically featuring text-based story and interactivity aided by static or [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]-based visuals. They resemble mixed-media novels or [[tableau vivant]] stage plays. The format has its primary origins in Japanese and other Asian video game markets, typically for personal computers and more recently on handheld consoles or mobile devices. The format has not gained much traction in Western markets.<ref name=ANN>{{cite web|date=8 February 2006| url = http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2006-02-08/amn-and-anime-advanced-announce-anime-game-demo-downloads| title = AMN and Anime Advanced Announce Anime Game Demo Downloads| publisher = Hirameki International Group Inc.| accessdate =1 December 2006}}</ref> A common type of visual novel are [[dating sim]]s, which has the player attempt to improve a relationship with one or more other characters, such as ''[[Hatoful Boyfriend]]''.

===Interactive movie===
{{Main|Interactive movie}}
Some adventure games have been presented as interactive movies; these are games where most of the graphics are either fully pre-rendered or use [[full motion video]] from live actors on a set, stored on a media that allows fast [[random access]] such as [[laserdisc]] or [[CD-ROM]]. The game's software would present a scene and then display options for the player to continue on, the choice leading to the game playing a new scene from the media. The video may be augmented by additional computer graphics; ''[[Under a Killing Moon]]'' used a combination of full motion video and 3D graphics. Because these games are limited by what has been pre-rendered or recorded, there is a lack of player interactivity in these titles, with wrong choices or decisions leading quickly to an ending scene. Interactive movies have seen a larger growth with the advancement of computing power that can render pre-scripted scenes in real-time, thus providing for more depth of gameplay that is reactive to the player (often including the use of [[quick time event]]s for more interactivity), but still following a pre-written story. Such games include [[Quantic Dream]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit (2005 video game)|Fahrenheit]]'' and ''[[Heavy Rain]]'', and many of [[Telltale Games]]' episodic adventure series such as ''[[The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead]]''.

===Hybrids===
There are a number of hybrid graphical adventure games, borrowing from two or more of the above classifications. For example, the ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series of games, while presenting itself as a visual novel, includes elements of point-and-click adventure games. The ''[[Zero Escape]]'' series wraps several escape-the-room puzzles within the context of a visual novel.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/12/17/999-9-hours-9-persons-9-doors-review | title = 999: 9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors - Review | work = [[IGN]] | first = Lucas | last = Thomas | date = 17 December 2010 | accessdate = 8 February 2016 }}</ref> The ''[[Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (series)|Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' series has the player use point-and-click type interfaces to locate clues, and [[minigame]]-type mechanics to manipulate those clues to find more relevant information.<ref name="IGN review">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/21/sherlock-holmes-returns-to-investigative-gaming|title=Sherlock Holmes Returns to Investigative Gaming|publisher=IGN|accessdate=21 June 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927022137/http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/21/sherlock-holmes-returns-to-investigative-gaming|archive-date=27 September 2014|deadurl=no|author=Campbell, Colin|date=21 September 2012}}</ref>

{{main|Action-adventure game}}
While most adventure games typically do not include any time-based interactivity by the player, action-adventure games are a hybrid of [[action game]]s with adventure games that often require to the player to react quickly to events as they occur on screen.<ref name="rollings446–447"/> The action-adventure genre is broad, spanning many different subgenres, but typically these games utilize strong storytelling and puzzle-solving mechanics of adventure games among the action-oriented gameplay concepts. The foremost title in this genre was ''[[Adventure (1979 video game)|Adventure]]'', a graphic home console game developed based on the text-based ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'',<ref name="rollings443–444"/> while the first ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' brought the action-adventure concept to a broader audience.

==History==

=== Text adventures (1976–1989) ===
[[File:ADVENT -- Will Crowther's original version.png|thumb|300px|[[Telechrome^type]] output of [[Will Crowther]]'s original version of ''Colossal Cave Adventure''.]]
''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (1976), written by [[William Crowther (computer programmer)|William Crowther]] and [[Don Woods (programmer)|Don Woods]], is known to be the first game in the adventure genre, and a significant influence on the genre's early development, as well as influencing core games in other genres such as ''[[Adventure (1979 video game)|Adventure]]'' (1979) for the [[action-adventure video game]] and ''[[Rogue (video game)|Rogue]]'' (1980) for [[roguelike]]s. Crowther was an employee at [[Bolt, Beranek and Newman]], a Boston company involved with [[ARPANET]] [[router (computing)|router]]s, in the mid-1970s.<ref name=montfort10/> As an avid [[caver]] and [[role-playing game]] enthusiast, he wrote a text adventure based on his own knowledge of the [[Mammoth Cave National Park|Mammoth Cave]] system in [[Kentucky]].<ref name=montfort10/> The program, which he named ''Adventure'', was written on the company's [[PDP-10]] and used 300 kilobytes of memory.<ref name=cameron40/><ref name=adventureland>{{cite web| url=http://www.alphaworks.com.au/scottadams/series.htm | title=Scott Adams Adventureland | accessdate=10 July 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080719230812/http://www.alphaworks.com.au/scottadams/series.htm| archivedate= 19 July 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The program was disseminated through ARPANET, which led to Woods, working at the [[Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] at [[Stanford]] at the time, to modify and expand the game, eventually becoming ''Colossal Cave Adventure''.<ref name=montfort10/>

''Colossal Cave Adventure'' set concepts and gameplay approaches that would become staples of text adventures and interactive fiction.<ref name=Salter23-24/> Following its release on ARPANET, numerous variations of ''Colossal Cave Adventure'' appeared throughout the late 1970s and early 1980s, with some of these later versions being re-christened ''Colossal Adventure'' or ''Colossal Caves''. These variations were enabled by the increase in [[microcomputer|microcomputing]] that allowed programmers to work on home computers rather than mainframe systems.<ref name=cameron40/><ref name=montfort88/><ref name="nelson349"/> The genre gained commercial success with titles designed for home computers. [[Scott Adams (game designer)|Scott Adams]] launched [[Adventure International]] to publish text adventures including an adaptation of ''Colossal Cave Adventure'', while a number of [[MIT]] students formed [[Infocom]] to bring their game ''[[Zork]]'' from mainframe to home computers and was a commercial success.
<ref name=Salter25-26/> Other companies in this field included [[Level 9 Computing]], [[Magnetic Scrolls]] and [[Krome Studios Melbourne|Melbourne House]].

When personal computers gained the ability to display graphics, the text adventure genre began to wane, and by 1990 there were few if any commercial releases. Non-commercial text adventure games are still developed today, as the genre of interactive fiction.

=== Early graphical development (1980–1990) ===
[[File:Mystery House - Apple II render emulation - 2.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Mystery House]]'' for the [[Apple II family|Apple II]] was the first adventure game to use graphics in the early [[home computer]] era.]]
The first known graphical adventure game was ''[[Mystery House]]'' (1980), by [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]], then at the time known as On-Line System.<ref name=Salter39-41/> The game featured static [[vector graphics]] atop a simple command line interface, building on the text adventure model. Sierra would continue to produce similar games under the title ''Hi-Res Adventure''.<ref name=high134 /><ref name=montfort169/> Vector graphics would give way to [[bitmap graphics]] which also enabled for simple animations to show the player-character moving in response to typed commands. Here, Sierra's ''[[King's Quest I|King's Quest]]'' (1984), though not the first game of its type, is recognized as a commercially successful graphical adventure game, enabling Sierra to expand on more titles.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/> Other examples of early games include [[Koei]]'s ''[[Night Life (video game)|Night Life]]'' and ''Danchi Tsuma no Yuwaku'' (1982), ''Sherwood Forest'' (1982), [[Yuji Horii]]'s ''[[Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken|Portopia Serial Murder Case]]'' (1983), ''[[The Return of Heracles]]'' (which faithfully portrayed [[Greek mythology]]) by [[Stuart Smith (game designer)|Stuart Smith]] (1983), [[Dale Johnson]]'s ''Masquerade'' (1983), Antonio Antiochia's ''[[Transylvania (computer game)|Transylvania]]'' (1982, re-released in 1984), and ''[[Adventure Construction Set]]'' (1985), one of the early hits of [[Electronic Arts]].

As computers gained the ability to use pointing devices and [[point-and-click]] interfaces, graphical adventure games moved away from including the text interface and simply provided appropriate commands the player could interact with on-screen. The first known game with such an interface was ''[[Enchanted Scepters]]'' (1984) from [[Silicon Beach Software]], which used drop-down menus for the player to select actions from while using a text window to describe results of those actions.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/> In 1985, [[ICOM Simulations]] released ''[[Déjà Vu (video game)|Déjà Vu]]'', the first of its [[MacVenture]] series, utilized a more complete point-and-click interface, including the ability to drag objects around on the current scene, and was a commercial success.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/> The point-and-click system also worked well for game consoles, with games like [[Chunsoft]]'s ''Portopia Serial Murder Case'' (1985) and [[Square (company)|Square]]'s ''[[Suishō no Dragon]]'' (1986), both on the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] using the controller input instead of text-based actions.<ref name=Square-Enix/><ref name=itmedia-dragon/> [[LucasArts]] started developing their own point-and-click adventures, starting with ''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' in 1987, and continuing a line of highly successful titles based on their [[SCUMM]] game engine.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/><ref name=Salter38-39/>

===Expansion (1990–2000)===
Graphical adventure games would continue to improve with advances in graphic systems for home computers, providing more detailed and colorful scenes and characters. With the adoption of [[CD-ROM]] in the early 1990s, it became possible to include higher quality graphics, video, and audio in adventure games.
<ref name="Rouse208"/> This saw the addition of [[voice acting]] to adventure games, the rise of [[Interactive movie]]s, ''[[The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery]]'', and the gradual adoption of three-dimensional graphics in adventure games, the critically acclaimed ''[[Grim Fandango]]'', Lucasarts' first 3D adventure.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/>

[[File:Myst-library and ship.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''[[Myst]]'' used high-quality [[3D computer graphics|3D]] rendered graphics to deliver images that were unparalleled at the time of its release.]]
''[[Myst]]'', released in 1993 by [[Cyan Worlds]], is considered one of the genre's more influential titles. ''Myst'' included pre-rendered 3D graphics, video, and audio.<ref name=Salter46-47/> ''Myst'' was an atypical game for the time, with no clear goals, little personal or object interaction, and a greater emphasis on exploration, and on scientific and mechanical puzzles. Part of the game's success was because it did not appear to be aimed at an adolescent male audience, but instead a mainstream adult audience. ''Myst'' held the record for computer game sales for seven years&mdash;it sold over nine million copies on all platforms, a feat not surpassed until the release of ''[[The Sims]]'' in 2000.<ref name="best-selling">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-overtakes-myst/1100-2857556/ |title=The Sims overtakes Myst |accessdate=17 March 2008 |author=Walker, Trey |date=22 March 2002 |work=[[GameSpot]] |publisher=[[CNET Networks]]}}</ref> In addition, ''Myst'' is considered to be the "killer app" that drove mainstream adoption of CD-ROM drives, as the game was one of the first to be distributed solely on CD-ROM, forgoing the option of floppy disks.<ref name="ign retro">{{cite web|author=Staff|date=1 August 2000|url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/082/082913p1.html|title=RC Retroview: Myst|publisher=IGN|accessdate=21 April 2008}}</ref><ref name="1up"/> ''Myst''{{'}}s successful use of mixed-media would lead to its own sequels, and other puzzle-based adventure games using mixed-media such as ''[[The 7th Guest]]''. With many companies attempting to capitalize on the success of ''Myst'', a glut of similar games followed its release, which contributed towards the start of the decline of the adventure game market in 2000.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/>

[[Sega]]'s ambitious ''[[Shenmue]]'' (1999) attempted to redefine the adventure game genre with its realistic 3D graphics, [[Third person (video games)|third-person perspective]], direct character control interface, sandbox [[Open world|open-world]] gameplay, [[quick time event]]s, and [[fighting game]] elements. Its creator [[Yu Suzuki]] originally touted it as a new kind of adventure game, "FREE" ("Full Reactive Eyes Entertainment"), offering an unparalleled level of player freedom, giving them full reign to explore expansive interactive city environments with its own day-night cycles and changing weather, and interact with fully voiced [[non-player character]]s going about their daily routines. Despite being a commercial failure, the game was critically acclaimed and has remained influential.<ref name=1UP/><ref name=Escapist>{{cite web |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_285/8455-Lost-in-Yokosuka |title=Lost in Yokosuka |last1=Main |first1=Brendan |date=21 December 2010 |website= |publisher=''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref name=GTM>{{cite web |url=http://www.nowgamer.com/features/1148/interview-with-shenmue-creator-yu-suzuki |title=Shenmue: Creator Yu Suzuki Speaks Out |date=8 January 2012 |website=nowgamer.com |publisher=''[[GamesTM]]''|access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref name=IGN/>

===Decline (2000–2010)===
{{see also|Graphic adventure game#Decline and rebirth}}
Whereas once adventure games were one of the most popular genres for computer games, by the mid-1990s the market share started to drastically decline. The forementioned saturation of ''Myst''-like games on the market led to little innovation in the field and a drop in consumer confidence in the genre.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/> ''Computer Gaming World'' reported that a "respected designer" felt it was impossible to design new and more difficult adventure puzzles as fans demanded, because Scott Adams had already created them all in his early games.<ref name="cgw199010"/> Another factor that led to the decline of the adventure game market was the advent of [[first person shooter]]s, ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]''.<ref name="Wolf187"/><ref name=Salter20/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070515/cook_01.shtml | title=The Circle of Life: An Analysis of the Game Product Life-cycle | publisher=gamasutra.com | date=15 May 2007 | accessdate=15 July 2008}}</ref> These games, taking further advantage of computer advancement, were able to offer strong, story-driven games within an action setting.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/>

This slump in popularity led many publishers and developers to see adventure games as financially unfeasible in comparison. Notably, Sierra was sold to [[CUC International]] in 1998, and while still a separate studio, attempted to recreate an adventure game using 3D graphics, ''[[King's Quest: Mask of Eternity]]'', as well as ''Gabriel Knight 3'', both which fared poorly; the studio was subsequently closed in 1999. Similarly, LucasArts released ''Grim Fandango'' to many positive reviews but poor sales; it released one more title, ''Escape from Monkey Island'' in 2000, but subsequently stopped development of ''Sam & Max: Freelance Police'' and had no further plans for adventure games.<ref name=Salter81-82 /> Many of those developers for LucasArts, including Grossman and Schafer, left the company during this time.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/> Sierra developer Lori Ann Cole stated in 2003 her belief that the high cost of development hurt adventure games: "They are just too art intensive, and art is expensive to produce and to show. Some of the best of the Adventure Games were criticized they were just too short. Action-adventure or Adventure Role-playing games can get away with re-using a lot of the art, and stretching the game play."<ref name="acg20030908"/>

Traditional adventure games became difficult to propose as new commercial titles. Gilbert wrote in 2005, "From first-hand experience, I can tell you that if you even utter the words 'adventure game' in a meeting with a publisher you can just pack up your spiffy concept art and leave. You'd get a better reaction by announcing that you have the plague."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://grumpygamer.com/3258434 | title = Adventure Games (via) | date = 23 July 2005 | accessdate = 17 February 2012 | publisher = [[Ron Gilbert]] | first = Ron | last = Gilbert |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612160141/http://grumpygamer.com/3258434|archive-date=12 June 2007}}</ref> In 2012 Schaefer said "If I were to go to a publisher right now and pitch an adventure game, they'd laugh in my face."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-02/09/double-fine-kickstarter | title = Tim Schafer persuades fans to finance next adventure game | work = [[Wired UK]] | date= 9 February 2012 | accessdate = 10 February 2012 | first = Mark | last= Brown }}</ref> Though most commercial adventure game publication had stopped in the United States by the early 2000s, the genre was still popular in Europe.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/> Games such as ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' by [[Funcom]] as well as ''[[Amerzone]]'' and ''[[Syberia]]'', both conceived by [[Benoît Sokal]] and developed by [[Microïds]], with rich classical elements of the genre still garnered high critical acclaims.<ref name="arstech gfx history"/>

Similar to the fate of interactive fiction, conventional graphical adventure games have continued to thrive in the [[Amateur adventure game|amateur scene]]. This has been most prolific with the tool [[Adventure Game Studio]]. Some notable [[:Category:Games created using AGS|AGS games]] include those by [[Ben Croshaw]] (namely the ''[[Chzo Mythos]]''), ''Ben Jordan: Paranormal Investigator'', ''[[Time Gentlemen, Please! (video game)|Time Gentlemen, Please!]]'', ''[[Soviet Unterzoegersdorf]]'', ''[[Metal Dead]]'', and [[AGD Interactive]]'s Sierra adventure remakes. [[Adobe Flash]] is also a popular tool known for adventures such as ''[[MOTAS]]'' and the [[escape the room]] genre entries.

===New platforms and rebirth (2005–onward)===
Following the demise of the adventure genre in the early 2000s, a number of events have occurred that have led to a revitalization of the adventure game genre as commercially viable: the introduction of new computing and gaming hardware and software delivery formats, and the use of crowdfunding as a means of achieving funding.

The 2000s saw the growth of [[digital distribution]] and the arrival of [[smart phone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s, with touch-screen interfaces well-suited to point-and-click adventure games. The introduction of larger and more powerful touch screen devices like the [[iPad]] allowed for more detailed graphics, more precise controls, and a better sense of immersion and interactivity compared to personal computer or console versions.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27947/InDepth_Your_Survival_Guide_to_the_iPads_Launch_Lineup.php | title = In-Depth: Your Survival Guide to the iPad’s Launch Lineup | first= Danny | last = Cowen | date = 5 April 2010 | accessdate =5 April 2010 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100407102150/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/27947/InDepth_Your_Survival_Guide_to_the_iPads_Launch_Lineup.php| archivedate= 7 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="ipad interview">{{cite web| url = http://www.destructoid.com/telltale-s-dan-connors-on-the-ipad-sam-max-169778.phtml | title = Telltale's Dan Connors on the iPad, Sam & Max | first = Dale | last = North | date = 3 April 2010 | accessdate =3 April 2010 | publisher = [[Destructoid]] | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100405003652/http://www.destructoid.com/telltale-s-dan-connors-on-the-ipad-sam-max-169778.phtml| archivedate= 5 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> In gaming hardware, the handheld [[Nintendo DS]] and subsequent units included a touch-screen, and the [[Nintendo Wii]] console with its [[Wii Remote]] allowed players to control a cursor through [[motion control]].

The Nintendo DS in particular helped spark a resurgence in the genre's popularity through the introduction of otherwise unknown Japanese adventure games, typically [[visual novel]]s localized for Western audiences.<ref name=Kalata-Snatcher/><ref name=Independent/><ref name=Olympian/> In 2005, [[Capcom]] re-released the courtroom-based visual novel game ''[[Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney]]'', originally a 2001 [[Game Boy Advance]] game released only in Japan, for the Nintendo DS in both Asian and Western markets.<ref name=Kalata-Snatcher/><ref name=Olympian/> The game and its [[Ace Attorney|sequels]] proved popular with Western audiences, and are credited for revitalizing the adventure game genre.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-review/1900-6135422/ | title=Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Review | publisher=[[GameSpot]] | accessdate=27 July 2010}}</ref> Following on ''Ace Attorney''{{'}}s success, [[Level-5 (video game company)|Level-5]] and Nintendo published the ''[[Professor Layton]]'' series worldwide starting in 2007.

Further, the improvements in digital distribution led to the concept of [[Episodic video game|episodic adventure games]], delivering between three and five "chapters" of a full game over a course of several months via online storefronts, [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], [[PlayStation Store]], and [[Nintendo eShop]]. Modeled off the idea of televisions episodes, episodic adventure games break the story into several parts, giving players a chance to digest and discuss the current story with others before the next episode is available, and further can enhance the narrative by creating cliffhangers or other dramatic elements to be resolved in later episodes.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/01/03/opinion-episodic-gaming-needs-to-change.aspx | title = Opinion – Episodic Gaming Needs To Change | first = Joe | last = Joba | work = [[Game Informer]] | date=3 January 2016 | accessdate = 28 January 2016 }}</ref> The first major successful episodic adventure games were those of [[Telltale Games]], a developer founded by former LucasArts employees following the cancellation of ''Sam & Max: Freelance Police''. Telltale found critical success in ''[[The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead]]'' series released in 2012, which eschewed traditional adventure game elements and puzzles for a strong story and character-driven game, forcing the player to make on-the-spot decisions that would become determinants and affect not only elements in the current episode but future episodes and in sequels. Its success was considered a revitalization of the genre,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/729486/the-walking-deads-season-finale-is-coming-next-week/|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=30 November 2012|last=Rosenberg|first=Adam|publisher=[[G4 (TV channel)|G4]]|title=The Walking Dead's Season Finale Is Coming Next Week}}</ref> and would lead Telltale to produce more licensed games driven by story rather than puzzles.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/2026802/how-adventure-games-came-back-from-the-dead.html | title = How adventure games came back from the dead | work = [[PC World]] | first = Rob | last = Manuel | date = 5 February 2013 | accessdate = 23 February 2016 }}</ref> The episodic format would become popular with other adventure games ''[[Life Is Strange]]''.

Online distribution has also helped lower the costs of brings niche Japanese titles to consumers, which has enabled another outlet for visual novels and dating sims to be localized and released for Western markets. Localization and distribution can be performed by small teams, removing financial barriers to bringing these games, often released as [[dōjin soft]] or hobbist titles, to Western countries.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gamasutra.com/blogs/CelsoRiva/20150713/248338/Making_and_selling_visual_novels_and_dating_sims.php | title = Making and selling visual novels and dating sims | first = Celso | last = Riva | date = 13 July 2015 | accessdate = 11 November 2015 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> A noted example of this is ''[[Hatoful Boyfriend]]'', a comedy dating sim in which the player attempts to date pigeons in a high school setting. The game was originally released in Japan in 2011, but received significant attention on its remake and localization in 2014, in part due to its humorous concept, and its distribution was supported by Western publisher [[Devolver Digital]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/06/date-a-pigeon-in-hatoful-boyfriend | title = Hatoful Boyfriend Coming to US This Summer | date = 6 June 2014 | first = Miranda | last = Sanchez | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref>

Meanwhile, another avenue for adventure game rebirth came from the discovery of the influence of [[crowdfunding]].<ref name=Salter136-137/> Tim Schafer had founded [[Double Fine Productions]] after leaving LucasArts in 2000. He had tried to find funding support for an adventure game, but publishers refused to consider his proposals for fear of the genre being unpopular. In 2012, Schafer turned to [[Kickstarter]] to raise $400,000 to develop an adventure game; the month-long campaign ended with over $3.4 million raised, making it, at the time, one of the largest Kickstarter projects, enabling Double Fine to expand the scope of their project and completing the game as ''[[Broken Age]]'', released over two parts in 2014 and 2015. The success led many other developers to consider the crowd funding approach, including those in the adventure game genre who saw the Double Fine Kickstarter as a sign that players wanted adventure games. Many sequels, remakes, and spiritual successors to classic adventure games emerged on Kickstarter, leading to a significant increase in traditional adventure game development during this time.<ref name=Salter136-137/> Some of these include:

===Japanese adventures===
Due to the differences in computer hardware, language and culture, development of adventure games took a different course in Japan compared to Western markets, generally focusing on [[visual novel]]s and its subgenres in comparison to point-and-click and other graphical adventures.

====Early Japanese adventures (1982–1986)====
{{see also|Visual novel}}
In the early 1980s, adventure games began gaining popularity in Japan. The country's computer market was largely dominated by [[NEC]]'s 8-bit [[NEC PC-8801|PC-8801]] (1981) and 16-bit [[NEC PC-9801|PC-9801]] (1982) platforms, which could display 8 simultaneous colors and had a [[Display resolution|resolution]] of 640×400, higher than Western computers at the time, in order to accommodate [[Japanese writing system|Japanese text]]. This in turn had an impact on [[game design]], as NEC PCs became known for adventure games with detailed color graphics, which would eventually evolve into [[visual novel]]s. NEC soon had several competitors such as the [[FM-7]] (1982), the AV (1985) version of which could display more than 4000 colors in addition to featuring [[FM synthesis]] sound. Its 16-bit successor, the [[FM Towns]] (1989), could display [[24-bit color]] (16.8 million colors) and featured a [[CD-ROM]] drive.<ref name="hg101_retro">{{cite web|author=John Szczepaniak|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/JPNcomputers/Japanesecomputers.htm|title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|accessdate=16 March 2011}} Reprinted from {{citation|title=Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier|work=[[Retro Gamer]]|issue=67|year=2009}}</ref>

Japan's first domestic adventure games were [[ASCII (company)|ASCII]]'s ''[[:jp:表参道アドベンチャー|Omotesando Adventure]]'' (表参道アドベンチャー) and ''[[Minami Aoyama Adventure]]'' (南青山アドベンチャー), released for the PC-9801 in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=月刊アスキー別冊　蘇るPC-9801伝説　永久保存版|url=http://ascii.jp/elem/000/000/341/341643/|publisher=[[ASCII (company)|ASCII]]|accessdate=19 September 2011| date=February 2004 }} ([http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ja&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fascii.jp%2Felem%2F000%2F000%2F341%2F341643%2F&act=url Translation])</ref> Another early Japanese adventure that same year was [[MicroCabin]]'s ''Mystery House'', which was unrelated to (but inspired by) the [[On-Line Systems]] [[Mystery House|game of the same name]].

The most famous early Japanese adventure game was the 1983 [[Crime fiction|murder mystery]] game ''[[Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken|Portopia Serial Murder Case]]'', developed by [[Yūji Horii]] (of ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' fame) and published by Enix. The game was viewed in a [[First person (video games)|first-person perspective]], followed a [[first-person narrative]], and featured color graphics.

The command selection [[Menu (computing)|menu]] input system, where the player chooses from a menu list of commands either through [[keyboard shortcut]]s or scrolling down the menu, was introduced in 1983, and would largely replace the verb-noun parser input method over the years.<ref name="Salter29" /> The earliest known title to use the command selection menu system was the Japanese adventure game ''Spy 007'' (スパイ00.7), published in April 1983, and it was followed soon after by several other Japanese adventure games in 1983. These included the ''eroge'' title ''[[Joshiryo Panic]]'', authored by Tadashi Makimura and published by Enix for the FM-7 in June and slightly earlier for the [[FM-8]]; ''Atami Onsen Adventure'' (熱海温泉アドベンチャー), released by Basic System (ベーシックシステム) in July for the FM-7 and slightly earlier for the PC-8001; ''Planet Mephius'', released in July; and ''Tri-Dantal'' (トリダンタル), authored by Y.

A distinct form of Japanese adventure game that eventually emerged is the [[visual novel]], a genre that was largely inspired by ''Portopia Serial Murder Case'',<ref name="Retro-85"/> and uses many conventions that are distinct from Western adventures. They are almost universally first-person, and driven primarily by dialog. They also tend to use menu-based interactions and navigation, with point and click implementations that are quite different from Western adventure games. Inventory-based puzzles of the sort that form the basis of classic Western adventures, are quite rare. Logic puzzles like those found in ''[[Myst]]'' are likewise unusual. Because of this, Japanese visual novels tend to be streamlined, and often quite easy, relying more on storytelling than challenge to keep players interested.<ref name=Kalata-Snatcher/>

[[Hideo Kojima]] (of ''[[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear]]'' fame) was inspired by ''Portopia'' to enter the video game industry,<ref name=Kasavin>{{cite web | url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/6120427/p-2.html | title="Everything is Possible": Inside the Minds of Gaming's Master Storytellers | accessdate=15 August 2007 | last=Kasavin | first=Greg | date=21 March 2005 | work=[[GameSpot]] | publisher=[[CNET Networks]] |page=2| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070929100614/http://www.gamespot.com/features/6120427/p-2.html| archivedate= 29 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> and produce his own adventure games. After completing the [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'', his first graphic adventure was released by [[Konami]] the following year: ''[[Snatcher]]'' (1988), an ambitious [[cyberpunk]] detective novel graphic adventure that was highly regarded at the time for pushing the boundaries of video game storytelling, cinematic [[cut scene]]s, and mature content.<ref name=1UP-Kojima>[http://www.1up.com/features/retroactive-metal-gear Retroactive: Kojima's Productions], [[1UP.com|1UP]]</ref> It also featured a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] science fiction setting, an [[amnesia]]c protagonist, and some [[light gun shooter]] segments. It was praised for its graphics, soundtrack, high quality writing comparable to a novel, voice acting comparable to a film or radio drama, and in-game computer database with optional documents that flesh out the game world. The [[Sega CD]] version of ''Snatcher'' was for a long time the only major visual novel game to be released in America, where it, despite a [[M for Mature|Mature]] rating limiting its accessibility,<ref name=Kalata-Snatcher>Kurt Kalata, [http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/snatcher/snatcher.htm Snatcher], Hardcore Gaming 101</ref> gained a [[cult following]].<ref name=Kalata-Policenauts/>

Following ''[[Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake]]'', Kojima produced his next graphic adventure, ''[[Policenauts]]'' (1994), a point-and-click adventure notable for being an early example of extensive voice recording in video games.<ref name=IGN-Kojima>{{cite web|title=Kojima's Legacy: We reflect on the influence of Hideo Kojima's 20 years in gaming|author=Mark Ryan Sallee|publisher=IGN|url=http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/715/715932p1.html|accessdate=20 August 2009}}</ref> It also featured a [[hard science fiction]] setting, a theme revolving around space exploration, a plot inspired by the ancient [[Japanese literature|Japanese tale]] of ''[[Urashima Taro]]'', and some occasional [[Full motion video based game|full-motion video]] cut scenes. The gameplay was largely similar to ''Snatcher'', but with the addition of a point-and-click interface and some [[first-person shooter]] segments. ''Policenauts'' also introduced summary screens, which act to refresh the player's memory of the plot upon reloading a [[Saved game|save]], an element Kojima would later use in ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]''. The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version of ''Policenauts'' could also read the memory card and give some [[easter egg]] dialogues if a save file of Konami's [[dating sim]] ''[[Tokimeki Memorial]]'' is present, a technique Kojima would also later use in ''Metal Gear Solid''.<ref name=Kalata-Policenauts>Kurt Kalata, [http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/policenauts/policenauts.htm Policenauts], Hardcore Gaming 101</ref> From 1997 to 1999, Kojima developed the three ''[[Tokimeki Memorial (series)|Tokimeki Memorial Drama Series]]'' titles, which were adaptations of ''Tokimeki Memorial'' in a visual novel adventure game format.<ref>[http://uk.ps2.ign.com/articles/088/088501p1.html Hideo Kojima Speaks], [[IGN]]</ref>

From the early 1990s, Chunsoft, the developer for the NES version of ''Portopia'', began producing a series of acclaimed visual novels known as the ''[[Sound novel|Sound Novels]]'' series, which include ''[[Otogirisō]]'' (1992), ''[[Kamaitachi no Yoru]]'' (1994), ''[[Machi (video game)|Machi]]'' (1998), ''[[428: Fūsa Sareta Shibuya de]]'' (2008), and ''[[999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors]]'' (2010). From the late 1990s, a number of Japanese adventure games began using a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Third person (video games)|third-person]] direct control format, particularly on consoles like the [[Dreamcast]] and [[PlayStation 2]]. Examples include [[Sega]]'s ''[[Shenmue (series)|Shenmue]]'' series (since 1999), [[Konami]]'s ''[[Shadow of Memories]]'' (2001), [[Irem]]'s ''[[Disaster Report]]'' series (since 2002), and [[Cing]]'s ''[[Glass Rose]]'' (2003).

In recent years, Japanese visual novel games have been released in the West more frequently, particularly on the [[Nintendo DS]] handheld following the success of mystery-solving titles such as [[Capcom]]'s ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' series (which began on the [[Game Boy Advance]] in 2001), Cing's ''[[Hotel Dusk: Room 215|Hotel Dusk]]'' series (beginning in 2006),<ref name=Kalata-Snatcher/> and [[Level-5 (video game company)|Level-5]]'s ''[[Professor Layton]]'' series (beginning in 2007).<ref name=Attorney-Layton/> English [[fan translation]]s of visual novels such as Square's ''[[Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hōseki|Radical Dreamers]]'' (a 1996 [[gaiden|side story]] to the [[Chrono (series)|''Chrono'' series]] of [[role-playing video game]]s) and [[Key (company)|Key]]'s ''[[Clannad (visual novel)|Clannad]]'' (2004) have also been made available in recent years.

==Notable developers==
Within the adventure game genre, several developers and studios became instrumental in the direction that the genre has taken.

===Adventure International (1978–1985)===
{{Main|Adventure International}}
Adventure International is a development company founded by programmer [[Scott Adams (game designer)|Scott Adams]] alongside his wife Alexis. Adams was a fan of ''Colossal Cave Adventure'', and had spent days to run through the game to achieve the highest score possible, "Adventure Grandmaster".<ref name=adventureland /><ref name=byte>{{citation | title=Pirate Adventure | magazine=Byte: The Small Systems Journal |date = December 1980| volume=5 | issue=12 | publisher=Gale Group }}</ref> From this, he was inspired to write a similar game for the home computer system [[TRS-80]], which lacked the memory capacity of the mainframes that ''Colossal Cave Adventure'' ran on. To get around this, he wrote a reusable [[high-level programming language|high-level language]] and an [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] written in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]].<ref name=adventureland /><ref name=crash>{{citation | last=Kidd | first=Graeme | magazine=Crash Magazine | title=Great Scott | issue=15 |date=April 1985 | url=http://www.crashonline.org.uk/15/adams.htm | accessdate=15 July 2008}}</ref> Adventure International was founded to sell the title, becoming the first commercially-sold adventure game.<ref name=montfort121/> Adams' second title, ''[[Pirate Adventure]]'', was an original game in a similar style to ''Colossal Cave Adventure'', and its source code, written in BASIC, was published in the December 1980 issue of ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]''.<ref name=byte /><ref name=montfort121/> In his subsequent games, starting with ''Mission Impossible'', Adams reworked his interpreter in [[assembly language]] that improved the speed of his software. Adventure International went on to produce a total of twelve adventure games before a [[North American video game crash of 1983|downturn]] in the industry led to the company's bankruptcy in 1985.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2006/07/gamesetinterview_adventure_int.php | title=GameSetInterview: Adventure International's Scott Adams | publisher=GameSetWatch | date=19 July 2006 | accessdate=16 July 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080623195741/http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2006/07/gamesetinterview_adventure_int.php| archivedate= 23 June 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Several adventure game designers and writers cite Adams' games as an influence on their own creations.<ref name="ign round table">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/02/the-past-present-and-future-of-adventure-games | title = The Past, Present, and Future of Adventure Games | date = 3 March 2015 | accessdate = 10 November 2015 | work = [[IGN]] | first = Kosta | last = Andreadis }}</ref><ref name="ew schafer">{{cite web | url = http://www.ew.com/article/2015/01/27/grim-fandango-creator-tim-schafer-on-the-adventure-game-revival | title = 'Grim Fandango' creator Tim Schafer on the adventure-game revival | first = Joshua | last = Riveria | date = 27 January 2015 | accessdate = 10 November 2015 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref>

===Infocom (1979–1989)===
{{Main|Infocom}}
Infocom was a game development company formed in June 1979 by, among others, [[Dave Lebling]], [[Marc Blank]], [[Tim Anderson (Zork)|Tim Anderson]], [[Bruce Daniels]], and [[Albert Vezza]]. Lebling and Blank were students at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s Laboratory for Computer Science at the time of ''Colossal Cave Adventure''{{'}}s release. Desiring to create a similar game, they worked alongside fellow students Anderson and Daniels to create the text adventure ''[[Zork]]'' for the [[PDP-10]] minicomputer, distributed via [[ARPANET]].<ref name=sloane77/> On graduation the students, together with their group leader [[Albert Vezza]], decided to form Inforcom to port ''Zork'' for home computers,<ref name=sloane77/>{{sfn|Montfort|2003|p=125}} As with Adams, Infocom was also limited by the size of memory on home computers at the time like the [[Apple II]] and TRS-80. They broke up ''Zork'' into three episodes to manage the size, and then created the [[Zork Implementation Language]] (ZIL) and the [[Z-machine]] to run ZIL programs, the first [[virtual machine]] used in a commercial product.<ref name=montfort127/> ''Zork'' was very successful, with the first episode ''Zork I'' released in 1980 and selling nearly 380,000 copies by 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/09/great_scott_infocoms_alltime_s.php |title=Great Scott: Infocom's All-Time Sales Numbers Revealed |date=20 September 2008 |work=GameSetWatch |publisher=Think Services |accessdate=23 September 2008 |first=Simon |last=Carless |authorlink=Simon Carless<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesetwatch.com%2F2008%2F09%2Fgreat_scott_infocoms_alltime_s.php&date=2008-09-21 |archivedate=21 September 2008 -->}}</ref>

The company continued to develop new text adventure games, expanding in size to over 100 employees at its peak; by 1984, they had sold over $10 million in game software.<ref name="mitrev">{{cite web | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/400384/fountain-of-ideas/ | title = Fountain of Ideas | work = [[MIT Technology Review]] | date = 1 May 1999 | accessdate = 10 November 2015 | first = Simson | last = Garfinkel }}</ref> Their success drew writer [[Douglas Adams]], who had loved ''Zork'', to help produce two games through them: the first based on Douglas Adams' popular ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', and an original work called ''[[Bureaucracy (video game)|Bureaucracy]]''.<ref name="infocom mit paper">{{cite web | url = http://web.mit.edu/6.933/www/Fall2000/infocom/infocom-paper.pdf | title = Down From the Top of Its Game: The Story of Infocom, Inc. | authors = Briceno, Hector; Chao, Wesley; Glenn, Andrew; Hu, Stanley; Krishnamurthy, Ashwin; and Tsuchida, Bruce | date = 15 December 2000 | accessdate = 10 November 2015 | publisher = [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] }}</ref> The company also attempted to expand into business software, writing the relational database program ''[[Cornerstone (software)|Cornerstone]]'', released in 1985; though ''Cornerstone'' was well-received, its release was at a time of a slump in software sales, and the company lost a significant amount of money on the title, as well as divided the company internally on progress going forward.<ref name="infocom mit paper"/> Struggling for funding, Infocom was bought by [[Activision]] in 1986 and returned to adventure game development, but following that, the increased power of home microcomputers and graphic-driven games saw the demand for Infocom titles decline. Infocom was late to add graphics to its games as to be able to compete with other titles until 1987. By 1989, the Infocom division at Activision had been reduced to 10 employees, and was ultimately shuttered; Activision would continue to develop some text adventure games inhouse using the Infocom brand but with no connection to the original team.<ref name="infocom mit paper"/> The demise of Infocom is considered to be the end of the commercial age for interactive fiction, but its legacy would remain; the Z-machine remains a popular source for running non-commercial interactive fiction games developed in more modern tools such as [[Inform]].<ref name="mitrev"/>

===Sierra (1979–1999)===
{{Main|Sierra Entertainment}}
Sierra On-Line was founded by [[Roberta Williams|Roberta]] and [[Ken Williams (gaming)|Ken Williams]] in 1980. Roberta had also been inspired by ''Colossal Cave Adventure'', and unable to find similar games of that type, wrote her own detective story based loosely on [[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' and the board game ''[[Cluedo|Clue]]''.<ref name=high134/> Once she had completed its design, she had convinced Ken to stop work on a [[FORTRAN]] compiler he had been developing as to bring her game to light on the [[Apple II series|Apple II]] home computer. The game, initially titled ''Hi-Res Adventure'', was ultimately released as ''[[Mystery House]]''; ''Mystery House'' was the first adventure game to feature graphics, using [[vector graphics]] atop a simple two-word command parser.<ref name=high134/><ref name=montfort169/> The Williamses initially sold the game on their own, achieving reasonable sales. Though Ken wanted to continue developing business software, they ultimately decided to continue to develop games, forming On-Line Systems in 1980, which they would eventually rename as Sierra On-Line.<ref name=montfort169/>

Sierra's initial games, labeled as part of the ''Hi-Res Adventure'' series, followed the same approach as ''Mystery House'', using a first-person perspective graphical view along with text commands; Roberta would design each game's story and puzzles, while Ken would program it. In 1983, [[IBM]] contacted Sierra to develop a game for their new system, the [[PCjr]], which featured more advanced graphics at the time as well as a more advanced sound system. Roberta designed a fairy-tale style adventure that would better visualized by the PCjr's graphics, and Ken developed software to allow animations include the player's character to occur on-screen in response to the player's typed commands. This was aided by the development of the [[Adventure Game Interpreter]], a virtual machine that used a high-level language to control. This game became known as ''[[King's Quest I]]''. It initially had poor sales due to its tie-in to the PCjr, but when IBM later abandoned the system, the Williamses were free to port the game to other systems, where it became highlight successful.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/06/a-year-of-adventure-1-kings-quest-i | title = A Year of Adventure #1: King's Quest | first = Kosta | last = Andreadis | date = 6 January 2014 | accessdate = 10 November 2015 | work = [[IGN]] }}</ref> Sierra began to expand, producing more games in the ''[[King's Quest]]'' series, which prompted thematic spinoffs in the ''[[Space Quest]]'' series by [[Mark Crowe]] and [[Scott Murphy (video game designer)|Scott Murphy]], the ''[[Police Quest]]'' series by [[Jim Walls]]. The company would also produce other adventure games including the ''[[Leisure Suit Larry (series)|Leisure Suit Larry]]'' series by [[Al Lowe]], ''[[Quest for Glory]]'' by [[The Coles|Corey and Lori Ann Cole]], and ''[[Gabriel Knight]]'' by [[Jane Jensen]]. As games featuring point-and-click interfaces began to become popular in the mid-1990s, Sierra also began to produce these types of games, including the forementioned ''Gabriel Knight'' series, ''[[Phantasmagoria]]'', and ''[[Shivers (video game)|Shivers]]''.

Sierra would develop new games and push the boundaries of adventure gaming until its purchase by [[Cendant]] in 1998. Then in 1998, Cendant sold off their entire interactive software branch for $1 billion to Havas Interactive, a subsidiary of [[Vivendi Universal]].<ref name="Kaplan">{{cite web|last1=Kaplan|first1=Karen|title=Havas to Buy Cendant Unit, Keep Employees|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/21/business/fi-46084|publisher=''Los Angeles Times''|accessdate=May 2, 2016|date=November 21, 1998}}</ref> At that point, the adventure game market was starting to wane as other types of genres became more popular, partially enabled by more powerful home console hardware such as the [[PlayStation]]. Sierra exited the game development sector, and was rebranded as Sierra Entertainment to help with video game publishing. They would continue to publish titles through 2008; at that time, Vivendi has been acquired by Activision, who shut down Sierra though kept the name. Following the resurgence of adventure games in 2010, Activision reactivated Sierra Entertainment for the first of several projects, the 2015 ''[[King's Quest (2015 video game)|King's Quest]]'' a new title in the series that was developed by [[The Odd Gentlemen]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Sierra Is Back!!!

===LucasArts (1986–2000)===
{{Main|LucasArts|LucasArts adventure games}}
[[File:Maniac Mansion.png|thumb|250px|''[[Maniac Mansion]]'' on the [[Commodore 64]], the first game to use the [[SCUMM]] interface]]
Lucasfilm Games was a game-development division spun off from [[Lucasfilm]] in 1982, making a wide variety of titles; it eventually was renamed as [[LucasArts]].<ref name=Salter38-39 /> LucasArts has made significant contributions to the adventure genre market in the 1980s and 1990s. Its initial foray was the text-adventure game ''[[Labyrinth: The Computer Game]]'' based on the [[Labyrinth (film)|film of the same name]].

In 1987, LucasArts developers [[Ron Gilbert]] and [[Gary Winnick]] created the graphical adventure game ''[[Maniac Mansion]]''.<ref name=Salter38-39/> Gilbert was inspired to add graphics after seeing Sierra's ''[[King's Quest]]'', having not been a fan of text-based adventure games. Gilbert created the [[SCUMM]] game engine (an initialism for "Simple Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion")<ref name="arstech scummvm"/> that enabled for a point-and-click game interface, which would be expanded upon and used throughout most other LucasArts adventure games.<ref name=Salter39-41/><ref name=Salter42-43/> Gilbert led the development of the comedic pirate adventure ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island]]'', the first LucasArts game taking advantage of 256 color graphics, bringing along two new hires to LucasArts, [[Dave Grossman (game developer)|Dave Grossman]] and [[Tim Schafer]], to help in writing and programming.<ref name=Salter42-43/> The team differentiated themselves from the Sierra games in that they eliminated any possibility of the player-character dying in the game, so that the player would never become stuck in a title.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.videogamer.com/xbox360/the_cave/news/ron_gilbert_talks_the_cave_optimism_and_high_stakes.html | title = Ron Gilbert talks The Cave, optimism, and high stakes | work = [[VideoGamer.com]] | date = 13 December 2012 | first = Neon | last = Kelly | accessdate = 23 March 2016 | quote = Gilbert: "The no death in Monkey Island really came from playing these Sierra games. I remember playing Police Quest once and I got off my little shift and went into the locker room, put my stuff in the locker, and then I walked out of the locker room and I got fired and the game was over because I didn't put my gun in the locker. It's just like, wait a minute... With Monkey Island, I just wanted to eliminate all of that. You know what? A game should just be something you experience, right? I just feel games are something that should wash over you and there shouldn't be this sense of failure. You may struggle with a puzzle, but you should never feel like you've failed." }}</ref> The game was highly successful, leading LucasArts to continue to develop titles in similar manner between Gilbert, Winnick, Grossman, and Schafer, including: the ''Monkey Island'' sequels ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'' and ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]''; ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'', a [[Chuck Jones]]-inspired sequel to ''Maniac Mansion''; ''[[Sam & Max Hit the Road]]'' based on [[Steve Purcell]]'s [[Sam & Max]] characters; ''[[Full Throttle (1995 video game)|Full Throttle]]'' which centered on [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gangs]] in the near-future; ''[[The Dig]]'', a science-fiction themed title developed in collaboration with [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Orson Scott Card]]; and the [[film noir]]-styled ''[[Grim Fandango]]'' that expanded the SCUMM engine to a three-dimensional canvas via the [[GrimE]]. Other adventure games developed by the LucasArts team included ''[[Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders]]'', ''[[Loom (video game)|Loom]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure]]'', and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'', These games would also integrate a fuller musical score through LucasArts' [[iMUSE]] system that was developed by music composers [[Peter McConnell]] and [[Michael Land]].<ref name="Brandon86"/>

At the time of ''Grim Fandango''{{'}}s release around 2000, the computer game market was seeing a shift to more graphics-enabled games due to updated computer speeds. ''Grim Fandango'' sold poorly, and LucasArts' next adventure game release ''[[Escape from Monkey Island]]'' was panned.<ref name=Salter82/> LucasArts cancelled two future adventure game projects, focusing more on action games, particularly those related to the ''Star Wars'' franchise which were better sellers.<ref name=Salter81-82/> Gilbert, Winnick, Grossman, and Schafer would leave LucasArts for other pursuits. Though LucasArts did not make new adventure games from 2000 onward, they did help to develop remastered versions of ''The Secret of Monkey Island'' and ''Monkey Island 2'' in 2009 and 2010 respectively, and were reportedly working on a similar remaster of ''Day of the Tentacle''. At that point in 2011, LucasArts was bought out and incorporated into [[Disney]], and the division was eventually shuttered in 2013.<ref name="vice lucasarts">{{cite web | url = http://www.vice.com/read/the-rise-fall-and-rebirth-of-lucasarts-adventure-classics-883http://www.vice.com/read/the-rise-fall-and-rebirth-of-lucasarts-adventure-classics-883 | title = The Rise, Fall, and Rebirth of LucasArts’ Adventure Classics | first = Richard | last = Corbett | date = 28 January 2016 | accessdate = 28 January 2016 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}</ref>

Most of LucasArts' adventure titles have been critically praised and still considered some of the best computer games over a decade from their initial release.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/189899/why_are_we_still_talking_about_.php | title = Why are We Still Talking about LucasArts' Old Adventure Games? | first = Frank |last = Cifaldi | work = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 5 April 2013 | accessdate = 28 January 2016 }}</ref> Because of their popularity, fans have developed the [[ScummVM]] emulation engine that allows these titles to be played on modern systems, and since has been expanded to include other adventure game engines such as from Sierra Online, [[Revolution Software]] and [[Adventure Soft]].<ref name="arstech scummvm">{{Cite web | url = http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/01/maniac-tentacle-mindbenders-of-atlantis-how-scummvm-kept-adventure-gaming-alive/ | title = Maniac Tentacle Mindbenders: How ScummVM’s unpaid coders kept adventure gaming alive | work = [[Ars Technica]] | date = 16 January 2012 | accessdate = 16 February 2016 | first = Richard | last = Moss }}</ref> [[Double Fine]], a company founded by Schafer following his departure from LucasArts, has been able to secure the rights to some of the LucasArts adventure games and has been developing remastered versions for modern computer systems. Their remastered version of ''Grim Fandango'' was released in 2015 and ''Day of the Tentacle'' in 2016, with ''Full Throttle'' expected for a 2017 release.

===Telltale Games (2004–present)===
{{main|Telltale Games}}
Telltale Games was founded in 2004 by a number of ex-LucasArts employees, including Grossman, following the cancellation of ''Sam & Max: Freelance Police''.<ref name=Salter141-142/> The company sought to continue the tradition of adventure games. Their initial games were standalone titles, including a [[Bone: Out From Boneville|two-game series]] based on Jeff Smith's ''[[Bone (comics)|Bone]]'' comics, and several games based on the ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' television series.

[[File:Walking dead telltale game dialog screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|Telltale's ''[[The Walking Dead (2012 video game)|The Walking Dead]]'' focused more on story and characters than puzzles and inventory, and was a critical success for both the studio and adventure games in general.]]
Telltale hit upon success on creating episodic adventure games, with ''[[Sam & Max Season One|Sam & Max: Season One]]'' in 2006 as an unofficial sequel to LucasArts' ''Sam & Max Hit the Road'' and inspired by their existing work they had done on the cancelled ''Freelance Police''.<ref name=Salter141-142/> Two further seasons of ''Sam & Max'' would follow, along with games based on other licensed properties, including ''[[Homestar Runner]]'', ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'', ''Monkey Island'', ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and ''[[Jurassic Park]]''. In addition to home computers and consoles, Telltale would also develop these titles for mobile devices, a growing market at the time.

A subsequent licensing deal with [[Warner Bros. Entertainment]] brought the studio the rights to develop games based on [[Robert Kirkman]]'s ''[[The Walking Dead (comic book)|The Walking Dead]]'' and [[Bill Willingham]]'s ''[[Fables (comics)|Fables]]'' comics. The first endeavor completed was the [[The Walking Dead (2012 video game)|2012 ''The Walking Dead'' video game]], which had the same episodic nature as the studio's earlier games but was built more on developing characters and story over traditional puzzle elements. The game required the player to make significant game-changing decisions including the death of non-playable characters, sometimes with only a few seconds to deliberate which option to select through [[quick time event]]s. Choices made would create determinants that would carry through the remaining episodes and into subsequent seasons, allowing players to come to feel as if the story they are presented was more personal due to the choices they made. The game was praised critically for its emotional story and use of the adventure genre, as well as designed its release around a timed episodic schedule.<ref name="ign walkingdead"/> ''The Walking Dead'' was considered very successful,<ref name="ign walkingdead">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/29/serialised-storytelling-a-changing-landscape | title = Serialised Storytelling: A Changing Landscape | first= Scott | last = Clarke | date = 29 December 2012 | accessdate = 29 December 2012 | publisher = IGN }}</ref><ref name="ign ep3 sales">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/09/21/how-the-walking-dead-confounds-gamings-gloom | title = How The Walking Dead Confounds Gaming’s Gloom | first = Colin | last = Campbell | date = 21 September 2012 | accessdate = 28 November 2012 | publisher = IGN }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/01/04/behind-the-hit-iphone-game-the-walking-dead/ | title = Behind the Hit iPhone Game "The Walking Dead" | first = Matthey | last= Lynley | date = 4 January 2013 | accessdate = 5 January 2013 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] }}</ref> and one of the biggest surprises for the video game industry in 2012,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/183281/The_5_biggest_video_game_surprises_of_2012.php | title = The 5 biggest video game surprises of 2012 | first = Mike | last = Rose | date = 12 December 2012 | accessdate = 12 December 2012 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}</ref> and a "refresh" of the adventure game genre;<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/729486/the-walking-deads-season-finale-is-coming-next-week/ | title = The Walking Dead's Season Finale Is Coming Next Week | first = Adam | last = Rosenberg | date = 15 November 2012 | accessdate = 30 November 2012 | publisher = [[G4 TV]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://venturebeat.com/2012/12/23/2012s-most-innovative-game-ideas/ | title = 2012′s most innovative game ideas | first = Rus | last = McLaughlin | date = 23 December 2012 | accessdate = 23 December 2012 | publisher = [[VentureBeat]] }}</ref> Ron Gilbert noted that ''The Walking Dead''{{'}}s approach to appear to the mass market can make adventure games as relevant as other genres to larger publishers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vg247.com/2012/11/30/the-walking-dead-proof-of-the-mass-marketing-of-adventure-games-says-ron-gilbert/ | title = The Walking Dead "proof of the mass marketing of adventure games", says Ron Gilbert | first = Brenna | last = Hillier | date = 30 November 2012 | accessdate = 30 November 2012 | publisher = [[VG247]] }}</ref> Following ''The Walking Dead'', Telltale secures further deals to produce additional seasons of ''The Walking Dead'', and seasons based on the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''/''[[Game of Thrones]]'' book series, and the ''[[Borderlands (series)|Borderlands]]'' and ''[[Minecraft]]'' video games, among other deals. Telltale's episodic and deterministic narrative model has also been used by other developers, including ''[[Life Is Strange]]'' and ''[[Dreamfall Chapters]]''.

==Emulation==
Many classic adventure games cannot run on modern operating systems. Early adventure games were developed for [[home computer]]s that are not in use today. [[Emulator]]s are available for modern computers that allow these old games to be played on the latest operating systems. One [[open-source software]] project called [[ScummVM]] provides a free engine for the LucasArts adventure games, the SCUMM-derived engine for Humongous Entertainment adventure games, early Sierra titles, Revolution Software 2D adventures, [[Coktel Vision]] adventure games and a few more assorted 2D adventures. [[ResidualVM]] is a sister project to ScummVM, aimed to emulate 3D-based adventure games such as ''Grim Fandango'' and ''Myst III: Exile''. Another called [[VDMSound]] can emulate the old sound-cards which many of the games require.

One of the most popular emulators, [[DOSBox]], is designed to emulate an [[IBM PC compatible]] computer running [[DOS]], the native [[operating system]] (OS) of most older adventure games.<ref name=Salter83-84/> Many companies, like Sierra Entertainment, have included DOSBox in their rereleases of older titles.

Text adventure games are more accessible. There are only a small number of standard formats, and nearly all the classics can be played on modern computers. A popular text adventure interpreter is [[Frotz]], which can play all the old [[Infocom]] text adventures.<ref>{{cite web | title=Windows Frotz | website=Interactive Fiction Archive | url=http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXinfocomXinterpretersXfrotz.html | accessdate=15 September 2014}}</ref> Some modern text adventure games can even be played on very old computer systems. Text adventure games are also suitable for [[personal digital assistant]]s (PDAs), because they have very small computer system requirements. Other text adventure games are fully playable via [[web browser]]s.
