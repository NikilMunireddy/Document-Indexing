'''Highland''' ({{lang-gd|A' Ghàidhealtachd}}; {{IPA-gd|kɛːəlˠ̪t̪əxk|pron}})<ref>''[[Gàidhealtachd]]'' is used to translate ''Highland''; in other contexts it is used to translate ''[[Scottish Highlands]]'' and ''[[Gàidhealtachd|Gaeldom]]''</ref> is a [[Council areas of Scotland|council area]] in the [[Scottish Highlands]] and is the largest local government area in the [[United Kingdom]]. It shares borders with the council areas of [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Argyll and Bute]], [[Moray]] and [[Perth and Kinross]]. Their councils, and those of [[Angus]] and [[Stirling (council area)|Stirling]], also have areas of the Scottish Highlands within their administrative boundaries. The Highland area covers most of the mainland and [[Inner Hebrides|inner-Hebridean]] parts of the former [[Counties of Scotland|counties]] of [[Inverness-shire]] and [[Ross and Cromarty]], all of [[Caithness]], [[Nairnshire]] and [[Sutherland]] and small parts of [[Argyll]] and [[Moray (county)|Moray]].

==Gaelic language==
According to the 2011 UK census, there are nearly 12,000 Gaelic speakers in the Highland area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/download/meetings/id/65574/item_7_gig_2113_gig_report_141113_gaelic_data_from_census_2011 |title=Gaelic data from Census 2011 |publisher=The Highland Council |date=14 November 2013 |accessdate=11 October 2015}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}
[[File:Highland topo SRTM.png|thumb|Topographic map of Highland Council.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}]]
In 1975, the area was created as a two-tier [[Local government areas of Scotland 1973 to 1996|region]], under the [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]], with an elected council for the whole region and, in addition, elected councils for each of eight districts, [[Badenoch and Strathspey (local government district, Highland region)|Badenoch and Strathspey]], [[Caithness (local government district, Highland region)|Caithness]], [[Inverness (local government district, Highland region)|Inverness]], [[Lochaber (local government district, Highland region)|Lochaber]], [[Nairn (district)|Nairn]], [[Ross and Cromarty (local government district, Highland region)|Ross and Cromarty]], [[Skye and Lochalsh (local government district, Highland region)|Skye and Lochalsh]] and [[Sutherland (local government district, Highland region)|Sutherland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/highland/ |title=Highland |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=11 October 2015}}</ref> The act also abolished county and [[burgh]] councils.

In 1996, under the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]], the Highland Regional Council and the district councils were wound up and their functions were transferred to a new [[Highland Council]]. The Highland Council adopted the districts as management areas and created [[area committee]]s to represent them. However, the boundaries of committee areas ceased to be aligned exactly with those of management areas as a result of changes to [[ward (politics)|ward]] boundaries in 1999. Ward boundaries changed again in 2007, and the management areas and related committees have now been abolished in favour of three new corporate management areas: [[Highland Council|Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross]]; [[Highland Council|Inverness, Nairn and Badenoch and Strathspey]]; and [[Highland Council|Ross, Skye and Lochaber]]. The names of these areas are also names of [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]], but boundaries are different.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

To many people within the area, using the name ''Highland'' as a noun sounds wrong. ''[[Dingwall]] in Highland'', for example, sounds strange and is not [[Idiom|idiomatic usage]]. To refer specifically to the area covered by the council, people tend to say ''the Highland Council area'' or ''the Highland area'' or ''the Highland region''. Otherwise, they tend to use the traditional county names, such as ''Ross-shire''. ''Highlands'' sometimes refers to the Highland council area. More usually it refers to a somewhat larger or overlapping area.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The Highland Council headquarters is located in [[Inverness]] with most previous district council offices retained as outstations.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Highland Council covers an area of 26,484 sq.km. (10,225 sq miles) - which is 11.4% of the total size of Great Britain and is 20% larger than Wales.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-32734313 |title=Breaking up Highland Council into smaller areas debated |work=[[BBC News]] |date=14 May 2015}}</ref> The Highland and Islands division of [[Police Scotland]] also includes the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland (formerly [[Northern Constabulary]]) and therefore covers an area of 30,659 sq.km. which is larger than that of the state of Belgium.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/8226100.stm |title=Record police numbers on streets |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2009}}</ref>

{{Main|Politics of the Highland council area}}

===Councillors===

The [[Highland Council]] represents 22 [[Ward (politics)|ward]]s, of which each elects three or four [[councillor]]s by the [[single transferable vote]] system of [[election]], to produce a form of [[proportional representation]] in a council of 80 members.

====Political representation====

The [[Highland Council election, 2012|most recent election of the council]] was on 3 May 2012, and resulted in a coalition administration formed by all three political parties on the council, the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]], the [[Liberal Democrats]] and the [[Labour (UK)|Labour party]].<ref name="BBC 17May2012">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-18103519|title='Living wage' pledge as Highland Council elects new leader|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|date=17 May 2012}}</ref> The Coalition had 45 councillors and the other 35 councillors were Independents.

The current ruling administration was formed by the Independent group in June 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-33086239 |title=Independents form new Highland Council administration |work=BBC News |date=11 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="Council reps">{{cite web |url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/info/20003/committee_information/495/highland_council/4 |title=Political representation |publisher=Highland Council |accessdate=11 October 2015}}</ref>
