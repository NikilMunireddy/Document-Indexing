The '''Alabama Crimson Tide football''' team represents the [[University of Alabama]] (variously Alabama, UA, or 'Bama) in the sport of [[American football]]. The Crimson Tide competes in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) of the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association]] (NCAA) and the Western Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/onlineDir/exec/sponsorship?sortOrder=0&division=1A&sport=MFB |title=NCAA Sports Sponsorship |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=October 2, 2008}}</ref> The team is currently coached by [[Nick Saban]].

===Head coaching history===
{{Main|List of Alabama Crimson Tide head football coaches}}

Alabama has had 28 head coaches since organized football began in 1892. Adopting the nickname ''"Crimson Tide"'' after the 1907 season, the team has played more than 1,100 games in their 114 seasons. In that time, 12 coaches have led the Crimson Tide in postseason bowl games: [[Wallace Wade]], [[Frank Thomas (American football)|Frank Thomas]], [[Harold Drew|Harold D. "Red" Drew]], [[Bear Bryant]], [[Ray Perkins (wide receiver)|Ray Perkins]], [[Bill Curry]], [[Gene Stallings]], [[Mike DuBose]], [[Dennis Franchione]], [[Mike Shula]], [[Joe Kines]], and [[Nick Saban]].<ref name="Bama-NCs-text" /> Eight of those coaches also won [[athletic conference|conference]] championships: Wade, Thomas, Drew, Bryant, Curry, Stallings, DuBose, and Saban. During their tenures, Wade, Thomas, Bryant, Stallings, and Saban all won [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|national championships]] with the Crimson Tide.<ref name="Bama-NCs-text" />

Of the 27 different head coaches who have led the Crimson Tide, Wade,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=20063 |title=Hall of Famers: Wallace Wade |publisher=National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69A8jsR7n|archivedate=July 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 11, 2010}}</ref> Thomas,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=30012 |title=Hall of Famers: Frank Thomas |publisher=National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69A8paoBY|archivedate=July 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref> Bryant,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.footballfoundation.org/Programs/CollegeFootballHallofFame/SearchDetail.aspx?id=70009 |title=Hall of Famers: Paul Bryant |publisher=National Football Foundation's College Football Hall of Fame|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/69A8uT0DK|archivedate=July 14, 2012 |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}</ref> and Stallings have been inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].

University of Alabama law student William G.

On November 11, 1892, the team played its first game at a baseball park in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], winning 56–0 against a team composed of players from local Birmingham-area high schools.<ref name="history2" /> Alabama lost to both [[1893 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] and [[Sewanee Tigers football|Sewanee]] in 1893. After a winless campaign, [[Eli Abbott]], who played for the team in 1892, returned as a [[player-coach]] and led the 1894 squad. Alabama opened the season with a loss against {{cfb link|year=1894|team=Ole Miss Rebels|title=Ole Miss}} in what was its first game ever played outside the state of Alabama. The Crimson White then rebounded and won their final three games. After a victory over [[1894 Tulane Olive and Blue football team|Tulane]] at [[New Orleans]], Alabama returned to Birmingham where they defeated [[1894 Sewanee Tigers football team|Sewanee]] in their only home game of the season. They then closed the year with their first all-time win over [[1894 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] at [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]].

In spring 1895, the University [[University of Alabama System#Board of Trustees|Board of Trustees]] passed a rule that prohibited athletic teams from competing off-campus for athletic events.<ref name="Griffin">{{cite book |last=Griffin |first=John Chandler |title=Alabama vs. Auburn: Gridiron Grudge Since 1893 |year=2001 |publisher=Hill Street Press |location=Athens, Georgia |isbn= 1-58818-044-1 |page=13 |chapter=1896: Trustees Thwart Alabama}}</ref> As such, all games scheduled for the 1896 season were played on campus at The Quad.<ref name="Griffin"/> In their first game, Alabama shutout the Birmingham Athletic Club before they lost their only game of the season against [[1896 Sewanee Tigers football team|Sewanee]]. The Crimson White then closed the season with their second shutout victory of the year against [[1896 Mississippi A&M Aggies football team|Mississippi A&M]].

The team played only one game during the 1897 season and did not field a team for the 1898 season because of a ban restricting student athletes from traveling away from campus.<ref name="history4" /> The team resumed play in 1899 after the ban was lifted due to fan and student outcry.<ref name="history4" />

===Early 1900s===
[[File:ThinRedLine Alabama.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Alabama in 1906]]

1905 saw two [[College Football All-Southern Team|All-Southerns]] for Alabama in [[Auxford Burks]] and [[T. S. Sims]]. "The overworked Burks, who appeared to bear the entire brunt of Alabama's offense,"<ref name=biggame>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWv3BlnItIEC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Creating the Big Game: John W. Heisman and the Invention of American Football|author=Wiley Lee Umphlett|page=84}}</ref> collapsed on the field during the second half of a 12 to 5 loss to [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]]. Burks scored in the 30 to 0 victory over Auburn in what was then the largest crowd ever to see a game in Birmingham (4,000).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bryantmuseum.com/gameDetail.asp?GameDate=11/18/1905|title=Alabama vs. Auburn|accessdate=February 12, 2015}}</ref> He was said to be the school's "first running back hero."

Alabama was coached by Pollard from 1906 to 1909. The 1906 team won all its games but one; the loss was the program's most lopsided ever, a 78 to 0 victory by [[1906 Vanderbilt Commodores football team|Vanderbilt]]. Burks scored all of the points in the 1906 [[Iron Bowl]]. Auburn contended Alabama player Sims was an illegal player. The [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA) denied the claim. Following the 1907 season, the team adopted the [[University of Alabama traditions#The Crimson Tide|"Crimson Tide"]] nickname.<ref name="history3" /> The victory over [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] in 1907 at Monroe Park marked the first Alabama home game played in Mobile.<ref name="MonroePark">{{cite news |title=Whirlwind finish beats Louisiana: Alabama wins on 75-yard run in last 20 seconds |publisher=NewsBank: America's Historical Newspapers |newspaper=The New Orleans Item |date=November 24, 1907 |page=8  }}</ref> Jack Reidy returned a kickoff for 75 yards and the touchdown with 20 seconds left to give Alabama the win.

In [[1909 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1909]], Alabama had six consecutive [[shutout]]s to go 5–0–1 before they surrendered their first touchdown against [[Tulane Green Wave football|Tulane]] in their 5–5 tie.<ref name=a1>1909 Season Recap</ref> Alabama completed their season with a 12–5 loss to defending SIAA champion [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] at Birmingham to finish 5–1–2.<ref name=a1/>

Alabama was coached by Graves from 1911 to 1914. 1912 saw quarterback [[Farley Moody]] make All-Southern teams. In the Georgia game that season, the Bulldogs ran a trick play in which they threw the ball to a receiver who was dressed as a waterboy, on the field, carrying a bucket. The play did not prove decisive, as Georgia fumbled the ball away soon after, but the Bulldogs won the game after they recovered a botched Alabama field goal and scored in the final minutes.

[[File:BullyVandeGraaff.jpg|thumb|Bully Van de Graaff played at Alabama during 1911-1915.]]
Alabama was coached by Kelley from 1915 to 1917. [[William T. Van de Graaff|Bully Van de Graaff]] who punted, kicked, and played tackle, was Alabama's first All-American in [[1915 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1915]]. Bully's brothers [[Adrian Van de Graaff|Adrian]] and [[Hargrove Van de Graaff|Hargrove]] were also prominent Alabama football players in their day. Their younger brother was [[Robert J. Van de Graaff]], inventor of the [[Van de Graaff generator]] which produces high [[voltage]]s. In 1915, [[Thomas Kelley (coach)|Thomas Kelley]] coached only the first half of season (4–0) before he came down with [[typhoid fever]]. [[Athletic director]] [[B. L. Noojin]] and former Alabama quarterback Farley Moody took over the head coaching duties for the remaining four games of the season.<ref>Groom 2000, p. 26.</ref> The 2–2 mark achieved in Kelly's absence is still credited to his record at Alabama of 17–7–1. [[Tram Sessions]] made the composite All-Southern of 1917.

The school did not field a team in 1918 because of World War I, but resumed play once again in 1919 under coach [[Xen C. Scott]].<ref name="history4" /> Arguably the best season under Scott was his first, in which the team lost its only game to Vanderbilt and set a school record for victories in a season with 8–1 record. The 1919 team was led by All-Southerns [[Ike Rogers]], [[Mullie Lenoir]], and [[Riggs Stephenson]]. The next season the Tide went 10–1 suffering its only loss 14–21 at the hands of [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] (SIAA) champion [[1920 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]]. [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Joe Sewell]] also played for Scott.

Alabama joined the newly formed [[Southern Conference]] in 1922. Shortly after the end of the [[1922 college football season|1922 season]] in which he led Alabama to a 9–7 upset victory over [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]], head coach Scott resigned due to a case of [[Oral cancer|cancer of the mouth and tongue]] which was soon to kill him. An account of the drive to beat Penn: "Alabama came back strong in the second quarter on the back of leader [[Charles Bartlett (American football)|Charles Bartlett]]. Bartlett drove the team down the field on most notably a 22 yard run from the 27 that put the ball on the Penn 4 yard line. [[Allison Hubert|Pooley Hubert]] went in the rest of the way but fumbled the ball in the endzone. [[Clyde Propst|Shorty Propst]] recovered the ball and gave Alabama the 9-7 lead that they would never give up."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bryantmuseum.com/TLGDetails.asp?GameDate=11/4/1922|title=Alabama vs. Pennsylvania|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> The next week Alabama beat [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] 47–3 in what was then the largest crowd ever to witness a game at [[Denny Field (Alabama)|Denny Field]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bryantmuseum.com/TLGDetails.asp?GameDate=11/10/1922|title=Alabama vs. LSU|accessdate=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Bartlett was given honorable mention on the All-America team of [[Walter Camp]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/1937349/camp_1922_all_america/|title=Camp's All America Stars Show Why They Are Winners; Have Brains, Power, Spirit|work=Harrisburg Telegraph|date=December 26, 1922|accessdate=March 8, 2015|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|page=15}} {{Open access}}</ref>

===Wade and Thomas (1923–1946)===
[[File:Wallace Wade.jpg|thumb|upright|Coach Wade at Vanderbilt]]

Shortly after head coach Xen Scott's death, [[Brown University]] alum and Vanderbilt assistant [[Wallace Wade]] was hired as the new head coach. While Wade assisted [[Dan McGugin]] at Vanderbilt the Commodores went 15-0-2 over two seasons.

The team saw success quickly, losing just one southern game in his first year when [[1923 Florida Gators football team|Florida]] upset the Tide to close the season. The 1924 team won the Southern Conference, upset by [[Centre Praying Colonels football|Centre]] in its only loss. In 1925, Wade would lead the team to an undefeated season capped with a [[1926 Rose Bowl|Rose Bowl]] win over Washington for the team's first national championship. The win later became known as "the game that changed the South."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://www.cptr.ua.edu/news/roses.htm |title=The Football Game That Changed the South |publisher=The University of Alabama |accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> Intent on building a dynasty, athletics director [[George H. Denny|George Denny]] took advantage of the team's newfound popularity and began advertising the University of Alabama in metropolitan New York City newspapers. Students, football players and fans alike from the Northeast began enrolling at Alabama at such a rate that by 1930, over one-third of the student body was from out-of-state.<ref>Groom, 2000, p.52.</ref> Wade led the Crimson Tide to two more national titles in 1926 and 1930.

Wade was under fire after lackluster seasons in 1928 and 1929, which included narrow losses to [[Robert Neyland]]'s [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee Volunteers]]. Wade submitted his resignation on April 30, with the caveat that he coach next season. Tailback [[John Suther]] described the feeling before the Tennessee game that year, which Alabama won 18–6. "Coach Wade was boiling mad. He was like a blood-thirsty drill sergeant anyway, and those critics made him more fiery … He challenged us to help him shut up the loudmouths that were making his life miserable."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rolltide.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/102308aad.html |title=Alabama-Tennessee: A Southern Tradition |date=October 23, 2008}}</ref> Wade took the head coaching position at [[Duke Blue Devils football|Duke]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uSwsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_7kEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3069,2979016 |title=Prepare for Wade's team |work=The Florence Times-News |author=Burcky, Claire |date=September 28, 1931 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}</ref> Wade finished his career at Alabama with an overall record of 61-13-3. Wade coached Hall of Fame player [[Allison Hubert|Pooley Hubert]]. Other notable players included [[Johnny Mack Brown]], [[Hoyt Winslett]], [[Fred Pickhard]], [[Fred Sington]], and [[Herschel Caldwell]].

In 1931, [[Frank Thomas (American football)|Frank Thomas]] left his post as an assistant coach at [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] and accepted the head coaching job at Alabama, where he established himself as one of the top coaches in the nation. His bowl record at Alabama was 4–2, with wins at the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] (1935, 1946), [[Cotton Bowl Classic]] (1942), and [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] (1943). He coached future Hall of Fame coach [[Bear Bryant|Paul "Bear" Bryant]] during his time as Alabama's head coach. Other notable players included [[Don Hutson]], [[Vaughn Mancha]], [[Harry Gilmer]], [[Johnny Cain]], and [[Riley Smith (American football)|Riley Smith]]. Alabama would join the [[Southeastern Conference]] in 1933, winning the conference's first championship. Thomas would lead Alabama to two more national championships in 1934 and 1941 before health issues related to his smoking habits forced him to retire after a 14-year tenure as head coach of the program. Alabama did not field a team in 1943 because of [[World War II]]. Thomas led Alabama to a 115–24–7 overall record.

===Drew and Whitworth (1947–1957)===
In January 1947, [[Harold Drew]] was hired as the head football coach of the Alabama Crimson Tide.

Alabama had grown into a major football power and enjoyed consistent success over the past three decades, but Drew's successor, [[Jennings B. Whitworth|J.B. "Ears" Whitworth]], would lead the Crimson Tide to its worst three-year stretch in school history. From 1955 to 1957, Whitworth coached Alabama, where he posted a 4–24–2 record that included a 14-game losing streak from 1955 to 1956. In his first year at Alabama, Whitworth was only allowed to hire only two of his own coaches and forced to retain the rest of former coach [[Harold Drew]]'s assistants. This included [[athletic director]] Hank Crisp, Whitworth's boss, who was in charge of the defense. Whitworth brought assistant coach Moose Johnson with him from Oklahoma A&M. Following successive 2–7–1 seasons in 1956 and 1957, Whitworth was fired and replaced by [[Bear Bryant]].

Throughout the 1970s, the Crimson Tide was one of the most dominant teams in college football.

Bryant was not only loved by the people in and around the state of Alabama and the southeastern U.S., but by coaches all over the nation. [[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]], the legendary USC coach, had these words to say about Bryant. "He was not just a coach, he was the coach".

[[File:Bill Curry 2013.jpg|thumb|Coach Curry]]
[[Bill Curry]] left his alma mater [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and accepted the job as head coach at the [[University of Alabama]]. There he posted a record of 26–10, won a share of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) title in 1989 and made bowl appearances every year of his three-year tenure, the [[1988 Hall of Fame Bowl]] after the 1987 season, the [[1988 Sun Bowl]] after the 1988 season and the [[1990 Sugar Bowl]] after the 1989 season. In September 1988, he refused to fly his [[1988 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama team]] to play [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] because of fears that [[Hurricane Gilbert]] would harm his players. The hurricane never reached Texas A&M at [[College Station, Texas]], and Aggies coach [[Jackie Sherrill]] claimed Curry used the threat of weather as an excuse because his quarterback was injured. The game was rescheduled for December 1, when Alabama routed A&M, 30–10. Curry also suspended Alabama quarterback Jeff Dunn for breaking team rules prior to the [[1988 Sun Bowl]] against [[Army Black Knights football|Army]]. Curry was honored in 1989 as the [[Southeastern Conference football individual awards#Coach of the Year|SEC Coach of the Year]] and received the [[Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award]].

With all the success the Crimson Tide were having, most believed Curry would remain at Alabama for a long time as the head coach. However, tensions within the athletic department, particularly issues with Curry's contract, and three straight losses against arch-rival Auburn led Curry to resign so that he could go on to become head coach for [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]]. This move shocked the college football world. Curry later was the head coach of the [[Georgia State Panthers]].<ref>{{cite book |url=http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=5&ti=1,5&Search%5FArg=uncivil%20war&Search%5FCode=TALL&CNT=25&PID=18858&SEQ=20061211131425&SID=2 |title=The Uncivil War: Alabama vs. Auburn 1981–1994, Chapter 8 |publisher= Rutledge Hill Press |location=Nashville, TN |isbn=1-55853-354-0 |accessdate=December 3, 2006}}</ref>

The NCAA ruled before Alabama's bowl game that year that Langham had violated NCAA rules by allegedly signing with an agent after the previous season.<ref name="NCAA Public Report on Infractions at Alabama, August 2, 1995">{{cite web |url=https://goomer.ncaa.org/wdbctx/LSDBi/LSDBi.MajorInfPackage.ProcessMultipleBylaws?p_Multiple=0&p_PK=160&p_Button=View+Public+Report&p_TextTerms=ThisIsADummyPhraseThatWillNotBeDuplicated&p_TextTerms2=ThisIsADummyPhraseThatWillNotBeDuplicated&p_Division=1 |title=NCAA Public Report on Infractions at Alabama |accessdate=December 11, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}</ref>

Stallings' [[1994 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] team was in contention for another national title in [[1994 NCAA Division I-A football season|1994]]. They defeated Tennessee and Auburn en route to an undefeated regular season before losing the [[1994 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]] to the #3-ranked [[1994 Florida Gators football team|Florida]]. Alabama finished 12–1 after defeating [[1994 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]] in the [[1995 Florida Citrus Bowl|Citrus Bowl]]. Alabama finished ranked #5 in the AP Poll.

Though going 8–3 in [[1995 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1995]], Alabama was not allowed to play in a bowl game, due to a probationary stipulation resulting from the Langham incident.<ref name="NCAA Public Report on Infractions at Alabama, August 2, 1995" />

In 1996 Stallings led the team to a 10–3 record, a victory over Auburn, and a victory over [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] in the [[1997 Outback Bowl|Outback Bowl]]. The [[1996 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|1996 season]] was Stallings' last season before retirement.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gD4dAAAAIBAJ&sjid=g6YEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5852,4514701 |title=Stallings resigns as coach |work=The Tuscaloosa News |author=Hurt, Cecil |date=November 24, 1996 |accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref> Stallings finished his tenure at Alabama with an impressive 70–16–1 on the field record.

===DuBose and Franchione (1997–2002)===
Following Gene Stallings's retirement in 1996, defensive coordinator [[Mike DuBose]] was promoted to the head coaching position.<ref>{{cite news |title=Alabama's DuBose is promoted to head coach |work=Boston Globe |date=December 10, 1996 <!--|accessdate=October 6, 2008-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19961209&slug=2364091 |title=Alliance Leaves Byu (13–1) Out |work=Seattle Times |date=December 9, 1996 |accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> In 1997, DuBose's first season at Alabama, the Crimson Tide won its first two games and rose as high as #11 in the AP Poll. However, the loss of 30 scholarships removed the team's ability to compete consistently. Alabama lost seven of the last nine games, including their first loss to [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] since 1922. Alabama also lost to Tennessee, [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]], and, in an upset, to [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]]. In the 1997 Iron Bowl Alabama lost after they led 17–15 with less than a minute to go. Faced with third down and long, Alabama ran a screen pass, which resulted in a fumble. Auburn recovered the fumble and kicked the game-winning field goal. DuBose reacted by firing four assistants including the ones who called the final play, [[Bruce Arians]] and [[Woody McCorvey]]. The Tide finished with the school's worst record since 1957. In his [[1998 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|second season]], Dubose led Alabama to a 7-5 record, which included a 31-17 win over Auburn. In his [[1999 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|third season]], DuBose led Alabama to a 10-3 record, including an upset win over the #3-ranked [[Florida Gators football|Florida Gators]] in the regular season, an SEC West Division Championship, and a 34-7 victory over Florida in the [[1999 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship]].<ref>{{cite news |title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL / SEC CHAMPIONSHIP; Alabama Dominates Florida |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 5, 1999 <!--|accessdate=October 6, 2008-->}}</ref> Alabama represented the SEC in the BCS Orange Bowl, losing to the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]] in overtime. With the 1999 success, [[2000 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] began [[2000 NCAA Division I FBS football season|their 2000 season]] as high as No. 3 in some polls. The expectations went unfulfilled as the Tide slumped to a 3–8 record and news broke about an affair DuBose was having with his secretary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schnatz |first=Pete |url=http://articles.philly.com/1999-12-31/sports/25478618_1_alabama-mike-dubose-orange-bowl |title='Bama Coach Was Down, But He Wasn't Out Not Long Ago, Mike Dubose Saw His Job Threatened By Scandal.

[[File:CoachFranTXST.png|thumb|Coach Franchione]]
[[Dennis Franchione]] became the head coach at the [[University of Alabama]] in 2001<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bama-hires-tcus-franchione/ |title='Bama Hires TCU's Franchione |work=[[CBS News]]|date=November 30, 2000}}</ref> and led the team, which had posted a 3–8 record the prior season, to a 7–5 record in 2001 and a 10–3 record in 2002. The 2001 team won the [[Independence Bowl]], which became Alabama's first bowl win after five seasons. The 2002 team finished with a 6–2 conference record, placing first in the West Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]]. However, due to [[NCAA]] sanctions resulting from violations of the previous Alabama head coach, [[Mike DuBose]], the 2002 team was ineligible for postseason games, including the [[SEC Championship Game]]. The turnaround success Franchione made prompted Alabama officials to offer Franchione a 10-year contract extension worth [[United States dollar|$]]15 million. Franchione, however, did not sign the offer. Following Alabama's victory over the [[Hawaii Warriors football|University of Hawaii]] and the dismissal of [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] head coach [[R. C. Slocum]], Franchione resigned at Alabama and was named head coach at Texas A&M after publicly stating that he would not leave. His decision was influenced by the NCAA sanctions placed on Alabama, which included a two-year bowl ban, the loss of 21 scholarships over three years, and five years probation. Franchione did not return to Alabama after interviewing for the job, instead informing his players of his decision to accept the job at Texas A&M via [[video teleconference]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://robots.cnnsi.com/2004/football/ncaa/07/28/bc.fbc.franchionereturn.ap|title=Texas A&M coach ready to end moving days|publisher=Sports Illustrated|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=2007-11-07|date=2004-07-28}}</ref> Many Alabama fans noted the similarities between Franchione's departure from TCU and how he left Alabama. His departure from Alabama, and his use of video conferencing to inform his players and staff remains, as does his departure at TCU, somewhat controversial.

====Mike Price controversy====
On December 18, 2002, Alabama announced that [[Washington State Cougars football|Washington State]] head coach [[Mike Price]] was to be the next coach for the Crimson Tide program.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sec/2002-12-18-alabama-price_x.htm |title=Alabama hires Washington State's Price |work=USA Today |last=Zenor |first=John |date=December 18, 2002 |accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E2D9123DF93BA25751C1A9649C8B63 |title=PLUS: COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Price Is Expected To Coach Alabama |work=New York Times |date=December 18, 2002 |accessdate=October 6, 2008}}</ref> However, in May 2003, Price was removed from his position as the head coach, following a [[#Mike Price incident|controversy]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/moore/120546_moore05.html |title=Go 2 Guy: Mike Price never figured his date with Destiny would end like this |publisher=seattlepi.com |date=May 5, 2003 |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |first1=Jim |last1=Moore}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The price for Price may be his job in Alabama scandal |work=The Seattle Times |date=May 3, 2003 <!--|accessdate=October 6, 2008-->}}</ref><ref name="Price-fired">{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/ncf/news/2003/0503/1548767.html |title=Alabama fires Price for 'questionable conduct' |publisher=ESPN |date=May 5, 2003 |accessdate=March 10, 2009}}</ref>

Less than a week later, Alabama hired [[Mike Shula]], a former Alabama quarterback and then-quarterbacks coach for the [[Miami Dolphins]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E4D6173FF93AA35756C0A9659C8B63 |title=COLLEGES; Alabama Decides to Hire Mike Shula as Its Coach |work=New York Times |date=May 9, 2003 |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |first=Judy |last=Battista}}</ref> Alabama had reportedly been searching mainly for former Alabama players, including considering [[Sylvester Croom]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sec/2003-05-06-alabama-search_x.htm |title=Alabama looks at ex-Tide players in search for Price's replacement |agency=Associated Press |date=May 6, 2003 |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |work=USA Today}}</ref>

With the difficult offseason, the Shula-led [[2003 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Crimson Tide]] finished 4–9 in [[2003 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2003]]. Bama's [[2004 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|2004 team]] finished the regular season with a 6–6 record and made their first bowl appearance in three seasons.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alabama.scout.com/2/326694.html |title=Tide Makes Bowl Plans |publisher=Scout.com |date=December 5, 2004 |accessdate=October 17, 2008}}</ref> It was also the first season the team began playing all their home games exclusively at Bryant-Denny Stadium. In previous years, the Tide had played many of their biggest home games at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. During the offseason, Alabama once again was able to gain a "full" recruiting class, following a probation by the NCAA which occurred in 2001 resulting from [[#NCAA sanctions|recruiting violations]] that occurred during Dubose's tenure. In [[2005 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Shula's third season]], Alabama rolled to a 10–2 record, ending with a 13–10 victory in the [[2006 Cotton Bowl Classic|2006 Cotton Bowl]]. However, the [[2006 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|following season]], Alabama struggled to find consistency. The team ended with a 6–7 overall record, losing every road game of the season.

[[File:2010 BCS Champ.jpg|thumb|left|On January 7, 2010, Alabama defeated Texas 37–21 for the [[2010 BCS National Championship Game|BCS National Championship]].]]
Entering the 2010 season, Alabama was ranked No. 1, but losses to [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]], [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]], and Auburn (the eventual 2010 National Champion) gave Saban's Tide a regular season record of 9–3. Alabama was invited to the [[2011 Capital One Bowl]] where they dominated Big 10 Co-Champion Michigan State 49–7 to finish with a 10–3 record.

During the 2011 season the Tide was ranked No. 2 in the first 2011 BCS Poll behind division rival LSU. The Tide suffered their only loss of the season 9-6 in overtime to the LSU Tigers on November 5, 2011 in Tuscaloosa. Alabama finished the regular season 11-1 and ranked No. 2 in the BCS poll, which resulted in Alabama playing No. 1 LSU in the [[2012 BCS National Championship Game]] in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was Alabama's second BCS National Championship Game appearance in three years. Alabama won the game 21–0 behind one of the most dominant defensive performances in bowl history to finish the year 12-1. Alabama held LSU to the second fewest total yardage ever allowed in a BCS National Championship Game. It was the first time in a BCS bowl game that the opponent was held scoreless. In winning Alabama's second national championship in three years, Saban became the first coach to win three BCS titles.

In 2012, the Tide was again ranked No. 2 in preseason polls and rose to No. 1 following their first win over Michigan in the [[Cowboys Classic]]. Despite a late season loss to SEC newcomer [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]], Alabama won the SEC West and defeated [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]] in the [[2012 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]] to earn a berth in the [[2013 BCS National Championship Game]].

In 2014, Alabama once again completed its regular season with an 11-1 record and won the SEC West and then the [[2014 SEC Championship Game]], defeating Missouri 42-13. In the new [[College Football Playoff]], the Tide (as the #1 seed) lost to Ohio State (#4) 42-35 in the [[2015 Sugar Bowl]]. At the end of the 2014 season, Saban's official record at Alabama was 86-17 (91-17 overall, with 5 wins from the 2007 season being vacated).

In 2015, Alabama compiled an 11-1 regular season record, and then defeated Florida in the [[2015 SEC Championship Game]], giving Alabama its 25th SEC Title, the most of any team in the conference. The title earned Alabama a #2 seed in the 2015 [[College Football Playoff]]. In the second [[College Football Playoff]] #2 Alabama defeated #3 Michigan State, in a dominating performance, 38-0, earning Alabama a chance to play #1 Clemson for the National Title. In one of the best games of the young playoff #2 Alabama defeated #1 Clemson 45-40 with the key play being an onside kick recovered by Alabama to swing the momentum in favor of the Crimson Tide. Nick Saban's record at Alabama is 100-18 (with 5 wins vacated from the 2007 season).

==Championships==

===National championships===
National championships in [[NCAA]] [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] college football are debated as the NCAA does not officially award the championship. Despite not naming an official [[NCAA Division I FBS National Football Championship|National Champion]], the NCAA provides lists of championships awarded by organizations it recognizes.<ref name="Past-champs" /><ref name="NCAA-history">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncaa.com/default.php?id=91434 |title=NCAA History |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=October 7, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> According to the official NCAA 2009 Division I Football Records Book, "During the last 138 years, there have been more than 30 selectors of national champions using polls, historical research and mathematical rating systems. Beginning in 1936, the Associated Press began the best-known and most widely circulated poll of sportswriters and broadcasters. Before 1936, national champions were determined by historical research and retroactive ratings and polls. […] The criteria for being included in this historical list of poll selectors is that the poll be national in scope, either through distribution in newspaper, television, radio and/or computer online."<ref name="2009 Division I Football Records Book">{{cite web |url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/DI/2009/2009FBS.pdf |title=Football Bowl Subdivision Records pp. 76–78 |publisher=NCAA |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}</ref>

Since World War II, Alabama only claims national championships awarded by the final [[AP Poll]] or the final [[Coaches' Poll]]. This policy is consistent with other FBS football programs with numerous national title claims, including Notre Dame, [[USC Trojans football|USC]], and [[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]]. All national championships claimed by the University of Alabama were published in nationally syndicated newspapers and magazines, and each of the national championship selectors, and are cited in the Official 2010 NCAA [[Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] Record Book.<ref>http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/DI/2010/2010FBS.pdf</ref> In addition to the championships claimed by the university, the NCAA has listed Alabama as receiving a championship for the [[1945 college football season|1945]], [[1966 college football season|1966]], [[1975 college football season|1975]], and [[1977 college football season]]s.<ref name="Past-champs" /><ref name="NCAA-history" />

In Alabama's 1982 media guide, the last for Coach Bryant, 1934 is listed as the only national championship before Coach Bryant in a footnote about the school's SEC history. In the 1980s, Alabama's Sports Information Director Wayne Atcheson started recognizing five pre-Bryant national championship teams (1925, 1926, 1930, 1934, 1941) by adding them to the University's Football Media Guide. According to Atcheson, he made the effort in the context of disputed titles being claimed by other schools, and "to make Alabama football look the best it could look" to compete with the other claimants. Atcheson maintains that the titles are the school's rightful claims.<ref name=Solomon-2010>Solomon, John (January 6, 2010) "[http://blog.al.com/solomon/2010/01/got_12.html Got 12?

==Rivalries==

===Auburn===
{{Main|Iron Bowl}}
[[File:Alabama offense IronBowl 2010-11-26.jpg|thumb|left|Alabama on offense against the Tigers in 2010]]

The main rivalry of the Crimson Tide is against its in-state rival, Auburn University. The rivalry is considered to be one of the best and most hard-fought rivalries in all of sports. The Alabama-Auburn game has come to be known as the Iron Bowl.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html |title=The 10 greatest rivalries |publisher=ESPN |date=January 3, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080924064710/http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/other/bestrivalries.html |archivedate= September 24, 2008 |deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpehWR53e7AC |title=Football Feuds: The Greatest College Football Rivalries |last=Rappoport |first=Ken |author2=Barry Wilner |publisher=Globe Pequot |year=2007 |isbn=1-59921-014-2 |chapter=The Iron Bowl: Auburn-Alabama |page=77 |ref=FootballFeuds}}</ref> The outcome of the game generally determines "bragging rights" in the state of Alabama until the following contest. Due to the intensity of the rivalry, many families, marriages, and other groups are split over their respective teams. The game may also have implications as to which team will represent the SEC Western Division in the [[SEC Championship Game]].

On February 22, 1893, at Lakeview Park in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Auburn was victorious in the first ever Iron Bowl, 32–22. The series was suspended after the 1907 contest, due to violence and financial complications.<ref>[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 79</ref> In 1944, Auburn suggested to reopen the series, though the Board of Trustees at Alabama rejected. The series was resumed in 1948, with Alabama crushing the Tigers 55–0, which is still the largest margin of victory in the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.1122productions.com/brandon/ftbstats/2000/week10-2000.html |title=The University of Alabama Football Facts |year=2000 |accessdate=October 8, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081119155128/http://www.1122productions.com/brandon/ftbstats/2000/week10-2000.html| archivedate= November 19, 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://www.rolltide.com/archive_files/files/football/2007/mediaguide/176-181.pdf |title=This is Alabama Football: Iron Bowl |publisher=University of Alabama Athletics |page=157 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref> In the following contest, Auburn shocked Alabama with a 14–13 victory, which is credited with helping revive the series.<ref>[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 80</ref>

For many years, the contest was held at [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham, before the teams began alternating between Bryant-Denny Stadium, in Tuscaloosa, and [[Jordan–Hare Stadium]], in [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]]. Alabama currently leads the series at 44-35–1.<ref name="Record-book">{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/alab/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/history-stats.pdf |title=The Record Book |publisher=University of Alabama Athletics |accessdate=October 2, 2008}}</ref> Alabama won the recent 2015 meeting 29-13.

Despite the heated in-state rivalry with Auburn, Bear Bryant was more adamant about defeating his rivals to the north, the [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee Volunteers]].<ref>[[#FootballFeuds|Football Feuds]]: 81</ref> The series is named the [[Third Saturday in October]], the traditional calendar date on which the game was played. Despite the name, the game has only been played on the third Saturday five times between 1995–2007. The first game between the two sides was played in 1901 in Birmingham, ending in a 6–6 tie. From 1902 to 1913, Alabama dominated the series, only losing once, and never allowing a touchdown by the Volunteers. Beginning in 1928, the rivalry was first played on its traditional date and began to be a challenge for the Tide as [[Robert Neyland]] began challenging Alabama for their perennial spot on top of the conference standings.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=akYFAAAACAAJ |title=Third Saturday in October: Tennessee Vs.

Between 1971–1981, Alabama held an eleven-game winning streak over the Volunteers and, between 1986–1994, a nine-game unbeaten streak. However, following Alabama's streak, Tennessee responded with a seven-game winning streak from 1995–2001. Alabama has won the last nine  meetings from 2007–2015. Alabama won the most recent meeting 19-14 in Tuscaloosa, and leads the series 52-38–7.<ref name="Record-book" />

===LSU===
{{Main|Alabama–LSU football rivalry}}

A rivalry within the SEC Western Division occurs yearly between Alabama and the LSU Tigers. Starting in 1895, the Tigers were victorious 12–6 in the first meeting.<ref name="Record-book" /> The teams did not regularly meet until the mid-1960s during Alabama's dominance of the SEC. Between 1971–1981, the Crimson Tide won 11 consecutive times. In the 1969 game, LSU defeated Alabama 20–15 in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]]. Alabama did not lose again in Baton Rouge until 2000.

In 2007, the meeting was more heated following Alabama's hiring of head coach [[Nick Saban]], who previously coached at LSU. With the hiring, many media outlets dubbed the 2007 meeting as the "Saban Bowl".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/colleges/topstories/stories/110207dnspocarlton.2725d4b.html |title=LSU, Alabama to meet in first Saban Bowl |work=The Dallas Morning News |last=Carlton |first=Chuck |date=November 2, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more_sports/2007/11/01/2007-11-01_bayou_lsu_fans_brace_for_nick_saban_bowl.html |title=Bayou, LSU fans brace for Nick Saban Bowl |work=New York Daily News |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/collegesports/2003986699_grid01.html |title=It's Saban Bowl for riled LSU fans |work=The Seattle Times |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref> The Crimson Tide lost the first "Saban Bowl" in 2007, won the 2008 and 2009 meetings only to lose in Baton Rouge in 2010.

In 2011, the teams played as the consensus No. 1 and No. 2 ranked teams in the polls with LSU winning 9–6 in overtime. They played each other again for the BCS National Championship with Alabama winning 21–0 to secure its 14th National Championship. Alabama won the recent meeting 30-16 in Tuscaloosa. Alabama leads the head-to-head series at 50-25–5.<ref name="Record-book" />

==Controversies==

===NCAA sanctions===
In August 1995, the NCAA Infractions Committee found four rules violations by the Alabama football program. Alabama cornerback [[Antonio Langham]] signed with a sports agent and applied to enter the NFL draft in January 1993, and allegedly received deferred-payment loans. Alabama's football program was placed on probation with scholarship limitations, and a one-year post-season ban (1995). Eight wins and one tie from the 9–3–1 1993 season were forfeited.<ref name="AL1995NCAA1">{{cite news |first=Tommy |last=Deas |title=Forfeitures will revise UA history |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=XUmZziu-z7kC&dat=19950801&printsec=frontpage&hl=en |newspaper=The Tuscaloosa News |publisher=Google News Archives |page=4C |date=August 3, 1995 |accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref>

In February 2002, Alabama was sanctioned for providing impermissible benefits. The NCAA report states that a recruiter gave a prospective student $20,000 in cash, lodging and entertainment. During the [[2000 NCAA Division I-A football season|2000 season]], an assistant football coach in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] claimed an Alabama [[booster club|booster]] paid him US$50,000 to encourage one of his players to sign with Alabama.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tidesports.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/TSNCAA/208290014 |title=It's official: NCAA opens investigation |publisher=TideSports.com |date=February 23, 2001 |accessdate=December 24, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928195939/http://www.tidesports.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/TSNCAA/208290014 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://static.espn.go.com/ncf/news/2002/0201/1321198.html |title=NCAA puts Alabama football on five-year probation |agency=Associated Press |date=February 1, 2000 |accessdate=March 10, 2009}}</ref> A secret witness that helped convict the University of Alabama was later revealed to be Tennessee coach [[Phillip Fulmer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timetravel.mementoweb.org/memento/2010/http://community.foxsports.com/blogs/rlb001/2005/12/28/The_Controversy_of_the_Tennessee_Volunteers |title=The Controversy of the Tennessee Volunteers |publisher=Fox Sports |date=December 28, 2005 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2004-01-28-tennessee-ncaa_x.htm |title=No bargain with Tennessee in Alabama probe |work=USA Today |date=January 28, 2004 |accessdate=October 8, 2008}}</ref> The report included allegations of paying a high school coach to influence a prospect, violations of rules for honesty and cooperation, expense-paid visits to the campus, and cash payments to other football players. Although the NCAA stated that the University fully cooperated with the enforcement staff, Alabama received probation from 2002 to 2006, a post-season ban in 2002 and 2003, and loss of 21 scholarships over 3 years.<ref name="University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Public Infractions Report">{{cite web |publisher=NCAA |date=February 1, 2002 |title=University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Public Infractions Report |url=https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&key=526&publicTerms=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED |deadurl=no |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}</ref>

In June 2009, Alabama was sanctioned for textbook and supplies-related infractions, valued at approximately $40,000, involving 201 student-athletes in 16 sports. The football program was forced to vacate 21 wins from the 2005–2007, pay a $43,900 fine, and received a public reprimand and censure.
