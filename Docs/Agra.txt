==Climate==
{{Main|Climate of Agra}}
Agra features a [[semiarid climate]] that borders on a [[humid subtropical climate]]. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a [[monsoon]] season. However the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. This is a primary factor in Agra featuring a semiarid climate as opposed to a [[humid subtropical climate]].

==History==

Though Agra's history is largely recognised with [[Mughal Empire]], the place was established much before it and has linkages since Mahabharat period so Mahirshi Angira in 1000 BC.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
It is generally accepted that Sultan [[Sikandar Lodi|Sikandar Lodī]], the Ruler of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] founded Agra in the year 1504. After the Sultan's death the city passed on to his son Sultan [[Ibrahim Lodi|Ibrāhīm Lodī]]. He ruled his Sultanate from Agra until he fell fighting to [[Babur|Bābar]] in the [[First battle of Panipat]] fought in 1526.

[[File:One of the drawings of Mughal monuments at Agra and Fatehpur Sikri.jpg|thumb|The Red fort, Agra, c. 1820]]
The golden age of the city began with the [[Mughals]]. It was known then as Akbarabād and remained the capital of the [[Mughal Empire]] under the Emperors [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir|Jahāngīr]] and [[Shah Jahan|Shāh Jahān]]. [[Shah Jahan|Shāh Jahān]] later shifted his capital to [[Shahjahanabad|Shāhjahānabād]] in the year 1649.

Since Akbarabād was one of the most important cities in India under the [[Mughals]], it witnessed a lot of building activity. [[Babur|Babar]], the founder of the Mughal dynasty, laid out the first formal Persian garden on the banks of river [[Yamuna]]. The garden is called the Arām Bāgh or the Garden of Relaxation. His grandson [[Akbar]] raised the towering ramparts of the Great Red Fort, besides making Agra a center for learning, arts, commerce and religion. Akbar also built a new city on the outskirts of Akbarabād called [[Fatehpur Sikri|Fatehpūr Sikrī]]. This city was built in the form of a Mughal military camp in stone.

His son [[Jahangir|Jahāngīr]] had a love of gardens and flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort or Lāl Qil'a. [[Shah Jahan|Shāh Jahān]], known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Akbarabād its most prized monument, the [[Taj Mahal|Tāj Mahal]]. Built in loving memory of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal|Mumtāz Mahal]], the mausoleum was completed in 1653.

[[Shah Jahan|Shāh Jahān]] later shifted the capital to [[Delhi]] during his reign, but his son [[Aurangzeb]] moved the capital back to Akbarabād, usurping his father and imprisoning him in the Fort there. Akbarabād remained the capital of India during the rule of [[Aurangzeb]] until he shifted it to [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]] in the [[Deccan]] in 1653. After the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the city came under the influence of [[Marathas]] and was called Agra, before falling into the hands of the [[British Raj]] in 1803.

[[File:Agra, Main Street, c.1858.jpg|right|thumb|Agra, Main Street, c.1858]]In 1835 when the [[Presidency of Agra]] was established by the British, the city became the seat of government, and just two years later it was witness to the [[Agra famine of 1837–38]]. During the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] British rule across India was threatened, news of the rebellion had reached Agra on 11 May and on 30 May two companies of native infantry, the 44th and 67th regiments, rebelled and marched to [[Delhi]]. The next morning native Indian troops in Agra were forced to disarm, on 15 June [[Gwalior]] (which lies south of Agra) rebelled. By 3 July the British were forced to withdraw into the fort. Two days later a small British force at Sucheta were defeated and forced to withdraw, this led to a mob sacking the city. However, the rebels moved onto Delhi which allowed the British to restore order by 8 July. Delhi fell to the British in September, the following month rebels who had fled Delhi along with rebels from Central India marched on Agra but were defeated. After this British rule was again secured over the city until the independence of India in 1947.<ref name='Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago'>{{cite journal|title=Agra City|journal=Imperial Gazetteer of India (Digital South Asia Library of University of Chicago)|volume=5|pages=83–84|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V05_091.gif|format=GIF|accessdate=2009-11-08 }}</ref>

Agra is the birthplace of the religion known as [[Din-i-Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], which flourished during the reign of [[Akbar]] and also of the [[Radha Swami|Radhaswami Faith]], which has around two million followers worldwide.
Agra has historic linkages with Shauripur of Jainism and Runukta of Hinduism, of 1000 BC.

Tāj Mahal, Agra Fort and [[Fatehpur Sikri]] are all UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

==Transport==

===Air===
Air India flies the following sectors in [[Agra airport]]:
                {{Quote|'''Delhi''' - '''Varanasi''' - '''Agra''' (Monday, Wednesday, Saturday)<br />
                '''Agra''' - '''Khajuraho''' - '''Varanasi''' - '''Delhi''' (Monday, Wednesday, Saturday)

                '''Mumbai''' - '''Agra''' - '''Mumbai''' (Tuesday, Thursday)}}

As of now Air India connects Agra to the rest of the world via Mumbai, Delhi 5 days a week. These flights are usually on time and observe full load factor. Agra still needs many more daily flights to '''Kolkata''', '''Jaipur''', '''Goa''', '''Kochi''', '''Delhi''', '''Mumbai''',  '''Lucknow''', '''Varanasi''' and other tourist destinations within the country.
Many airlines are showing interest to start services from Agra in near future.

==== Taj International Airport ====
A new greenfield international airport is proposed for Agra in a bid to give required fillip to tourism in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. [[Taj international Airport]] project at Agra would be implemented in right earnest with the state government according top priority to this project as [[Taj Mahal]] is one of the most visited tourist spots in the world.

Consortium of Rites Ltd and KPMG Advisory Services Pvt Ltd, the selected consultants for this project, made a detailed presentation to Infrastructure and Industrial Development Commissioner(IIDC), Anil Kumar Gupta on the future course of action. Consultants were asked to identify the best suited site by the end of the current financial year.

The project site would be selected in a way so as to enable prompt clearances and approvals for the implementation without any hindrances. To be developed through Public Private Partnership (PPP), in order to ensure time-bound execution of the project, the government has assured full cooperation at all levels of administration. Development of an international airport near the Taj Mahal will enhance the tourist inflow, the new airport would also cater to needs of frequent fliers, entrepreneurs and exporters from the region. If everything goes to plan, Agra will have an international airport within four to five years.

===Rail===
{{Main|Railways in Agra}}
Agra is on the central train line between [[Delhi]] (Station Code: NDLS) and Bombay (Station Code: CSTM) and between [[Delhi]] and [[Madras]] (Station Code: MAS) and many trains like [[Bhopal Shatabdi]], [[Taj Express]], [[Bhopal Express]], [[Malwa Express]], [[Gondwana Express]], [[Jabalpur - Jammutawi Express]], [[Shreedham Express]], [[Garib Rath]], [[Tamil Nadu Express]], [[Chennai Rajdhani]], [[Allahabad Mathura Express]] etc. connect Agra with all major Indian cities like [[New Delhi]], [[Bombay]], [[Calcutta]], [[Madras]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Bengaluru]], [[Pune]], [[Bhopal]], [[Indore]], [[Kochi]], [[Gwalior]], [[Jabalpur]], [[Ujjain]], [[Jaipur]], [[Aligarh]], [[Mathura]], [[Alwar]], [[Lucknow]], [[Thiruvananthapuram]] etc. every day. Some east-bound trains from [[Delhi]] also travel via Agra, so direct connections to points in Eastern India (including Calcutta are also available. There are close to 20 trains to [[New Delhi railway station|New Delhi]] and [[Gwalior Junction]] every day, and at least three or four to Bhopal, Indore, Nagpur, Bombay and Madras. There are three main railway stations in Agra.

====Agra-Delhi Semi-High Speed Train====
In July 2014, a trial run of a "[[semi-high speed train]]" with 10 coaches and 2 generators reached a speed of {{convert|160|km/h|0|abbr=on}} between New Delhi and Agra. The railways plan to introduce such trains commercially from November 2014. New Delhi Agra  Shatabdi Express is same type of train, which takes 2 hours to complete its journey. A new semi-high speed train Gatimaan Express that reduces travel time between Delhi and Agra to 100 minutes has been started from 5th April 2016.

===Road===

[[Idgah Bus Stand]], Taj Depot, Ford Depot and Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) are the major bus stands in Agra, connecting Agra to most of the bigger cities in North India. It is a major junction of highways with 3 national highways and 1 expressway originating from Agra. Another national highway passes through the city bringing the total highway outlet to 6.

*From [[Delhi]]: [[National Highway 2 (India)|NH2]], a modern divided highway, connects the {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} distance from Delhi to Agra. The drive is about 4 hours. The primary access to the highway is along Mathura Road in Delhi but, if coming from South Delhi or Delhi Airport, it is easier to take Aurobindo Marg (Mehrauli Road) and then work up to NH2 via Tughlakabad.
*From Delhi / [[Noida]]: [[Yamuna Expressway]], a modern access controlled highway connects the {{convert|200|km|0|abbr=on}} distance from Delhi to Agra. The drive is about 2 hours. This highway has junction to [[Aligarh]] and [[Mathura]] via state highways.
*[[Yamuna Expressway]] (formerly Taj Expressway) is a 6-lane (extendable to 8 lanes), {{convert|165|km|0|abbr=on}} long, controlled-access expressway, that connects [[Greater Noida]] with Agra via [[Khair]] and [[Mathura]] in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
*[[NH 93]] is a National Highway that connects Agra to [[Moradabad]] via [[Aligarh]]

===Local transport===
Bus services are run by the [[Agra Municipal Corporation]]. Other para-transit modes include rickshaws and autorickshaws. While passengers need to negotiate rates for the rickshaws and they are usually expensive, there is a system of (what is called) 'Tempo' which are autorickshaws that run on specific routes called out by the drivers. Tempos take around 6 people simultaneously and work out to be the most economical and practical. Polluting vehicles are not allowed near the [[Taj Mahal|Tāj Mahal]], so one needs to take electric autos or [[Tanga (carriage)|Tanga]] (Tonga) from a few kilometres outside the [[Taj Mahal|Tāj Mahal]].
[http://tourmet.com/agra/] is located at Agra Cantt railways station.

===Metro===
[[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra Fort]] and [[Akbar's Tomb]], besides many other landmarks of the city will now have metro rail connectivity. The feasibility report submitted by Rail India Technical and Economic Service [[(RITES)]] has proposed 30 stations, 11 underground and 19 elevated, for two corridors of the [[Rapid transit|Metro Rail]] in the city in the first phase. The two routes are [[Sikandra]] to [[Taj Mahal]] East gate via [[Agra Fort]] and [[Agra Cantt]] to [[Kalindi Vihar]].

[[File:Persian prince tomb taj mahal.jpg|thumb|Tombs of [[Shah Jahan]] and his beloved wife, [[Mumtaz Mahal]].]]

Completed in 1653, the Tāj Mahal was built by the Mughal king Shah Jahan as the final resting place for his beloved wife, Mumtāz Mahal. Finished in marble, it is perhaps India's most beautiful monument. This perfectly symmetrical monument took 22 years (1630–1652) of labour and 20,000 workers, masons and jewellers to build{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} and is set amidst landscaped gardens. Built by the Persian architect, Ustād 'Īsā, the Tāj Mahal is on the south bank of the [[Yamuna]] River. It can be observed from [[Agra Fort]] from where Emperor Shāh Jahān gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son [[Aurangzeb]]. It is an acknowledged masterpiece of symmetry.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Verses of the [[Quran]] are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are twenty-two small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Tāj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant dome of the Tāj Mahal has a diameter of {{convert|60|ft|m}}, and rises to a height of {{convert|80|ft|m}}; directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtāz Mahal. Shah Jahān's tomb was erected next to hers by his son Aurangzeb. The interiors are decorated with fine inlay work, incorporating semi-precious stones.

===Agra Fort===
{{main|Agra Fort}}
[[File:AgraFort.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Amar Singh Gate]]'',<br> one of two entrances into Agra's Red Fort]]
[[Agra Fort]] (sometimes called the ''Red Fort''), was commissioned by the great Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] in 1565, and is another of Agra's [[World Heritage Sites]]. A stone tablet at the gate of the Fort states that it had been built before 1000 but was later renovated by Akbar. The red sandstone fort was converted into a palace during [[Shah Jahan|Shāh Jahān]]'s time, and reworked extensively with [[marble]] and [[pietra dura]] inlay. Notable buildings in the fort include the [[Moti Masjid, Agra|Pearl Mosque]] or ''Motī Masjid'', the Dīwān-e-'Ām and Dīwān-e-Khās (halls of public and private audience), [[Jahangir|Jahāngīr's Palace]], Khās Mahal, Shīsh Mahal (mirrored palace), and the [[Musamman Burj]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

It has a total perimeter of {{convert|2.4|km}}, and is ringed by double castellated ramparts of red sandstone punctuated at regular intervals by bastions. A moat {{convert|9|m}} wide and {{convert|10|m}} deep surrounds the outer wall.

[[Chhatrapati]] [[Shivaji|Shīvajī]] visited the Agra Fort, as a result of the conditions of the [[Treaty of Purandar (1665)|Treaty of Purandar]] entered into with Mirzā Rājā Jaisingh to meet [[Aurangzeb]] in the [[Divan#Diwan-i-Khas or Ibadat Khana|Dīwān-i-Khās]] (Special Audience Chamber). In the audience he was deliberately placed behind men of lower rank. An insulted Shīvajī stormed out of the imperial audience and was confined to Jai Sing's quarters on 12 May 1666. Fearing the dungeons and execution he escaped on 17 August 1666.

The fort is a typical example of Mughal architecture, effectively showing how the North Indian style of fort construction differed from that of the South. In the South, the majority of forts were built on the seabed like the one at [[Bekal]] in Kerala.<ref>{{cite book|last=Koroth|first=Nandakumar|title=History of Bekal Fort}}</ref>
