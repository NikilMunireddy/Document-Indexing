==History==

===Founding by Isaac Royall===
Harvard Law School was established in 1817, making it the oldest continuously-operating law school in the nation. ([[William & Mary Law School]] opened first in 1779, but closed due to the [[American Civil War]], reopening in 1920.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wm.edu/law/about/quickfacts.shtml |title=Quick Facts: W&M Law School |publisher=Marshall-Wythe School of Law |accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> The [[University of Maryland School of Law]] was chartered in 1816, but did not begin classes until 1824, and also closed during the Civil War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.umaryland.edu/about/mission.html |title=The University of Maryland School of Law: Our History and Mission |publisher=The University of Maryland School of Law |accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref>)
[[Image:Royall.jpg|thumb|upright|left|200px|Portrait of Isaac Royall, painted in 1769 by [[John Singleton Copley]]]]

The school's origins can be traced to the estate of Isaac Royall, a wealthy Antiguan slave trader who immigrated to Boston. His Medford estate, the [[Isaac Royall House]], is now a museum which features the only remaining slave quarters in the northeast United States. The Royall chair was traditionally held by the dean of the law school. However, because Royall was a slaveholder, Deans [[Elena Kagan]] and [[Martha Minow]] declined the Royall chair.

The Royall family [[coat-of-arms]], which shows three stacked wheat sheaves, was adopted as the school crest, topped with the university motto (''Veritas'', Latin "truth").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2001/summer/gallery_main.html |title=Issues Archive &#124; Harvard Law Today |publisher=Law.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref> In March 2016, following requests by students, the school decided to remove the emblem because of its association with slavery.<ref>{{cite news|title=Harvard law school drops official shield over slavery links|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/05/harvard-law-school-drops-official-shield-over-slavery-links|accessdate=5 March 2016|work=The Guardian|date=4 March 2016}}</ref>

===Growth and the Langdell curriculum===
By 1827, the school, with one faculty member, was struggling. [[Nathan Dane]], a prominent alumnus of the college, then endowed the Dane Professorship of Law, insisting that it be given to then Supreme Court Justice [[Joseph Story]]. For a while, the school was called "Dane Law School."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1930/1/23/law-school-has-fine-portrait-collection/ |title=LAW SCHOOL HAS FINE PORTRAIT COLLECTION &#124; News &#124; The Harvard Crimson |publisher=Thecrimson.com |date=1930-01-23 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref>  In 1829, John H. Ashmun, son of [[Eli Porter Ashmun]] and brother of [[George Ashmun]], accepted a professorship and closed his [[Northampton Law School]], with many of his students following him to Harvard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MVjgf5yLEWMC&pg=PA277&dq=john+ashmun+northampton+harvard+law+school&hl=en&sa=X&ei=paJqT_3HJ-aAsgKwkMiHBg&ved=0CGUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=john%20ashmun%20northampton%20harvard%20law%20school&f=false |title=Antiquities, Historicals and Graduates of Northampton – Solomon Clark – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref> Story's belief in the need for an elite law school based on merit and dedicated to public service helped build the school's reputation at the time, although the contours of these beliefs have not been consistent throughout its history. Enrollment remained low through the 19th century as university legal education was considered to be of little added benefit to apprenticeships in legal practice.

In the 1870s, under Dean [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]], HLS introduced what has become the standard first-year [[curriculum]] for American law schools – including classes in [[contracts]], [[property]], [[torts]], [[criminal law]], and [[civil procedure]]. At Harvard, Langdell also developed the [[casebook method|case method]] of teaching law, now the dominant [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] model at U.S. law schools.  Langdell's notion that law could be studied as a "science" gave university legal education a reason for being distinct from vocational preparation. Critics at first defended the old lecture method because it was faster and cheaper and made fewer demands on faculty and students. Advocates said the case method had a sounder theoretical basis in scientific research and the inductive method. Langdell's graduates became leading professors at other law schools where they introduced the case method. The method was facilitated by casebooks. From its founding in 1900, the [[Association of American Law Schools]] promoted the case method in law schools that sought [[accreditation]].<ref>Bruce A. Kimball, "The Proliferation of Case Method Teaching in American Law Schools: Mr. Langdell's Emblematic 'Abomination,' 1890–1915," ''History of Education Quarterly'' (2006) 46#2 pp. 192–240 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/20462057 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Bruce A. Kimball, '"Warn Students That I Entertain Heretical Opinions, Which They Are Not To Take as Law': The Inception of Case Method Teaching in the Classrooms of the Early C.C. Langdell, 1870–1883," ''Law and History Review'' 17 (Spring 1999): 57–140.</ref>

===20th century: institutional criticism===
Throughout most of the 20th century, HLS was often believed to be a competitive environment. For example, Dean Berring of [[University of California, Berkeley School of Law]] once stated that he "view[ed] Harvard Law School as a samurai ring where you can test your swordsmanship against the swordsmanship of the strongest intellectual warriors from around the nation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.top-law-schools.com/berring-interview.html |title=Interview with Former Dean Robert Berring of U.C. Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law |publisher=Top-law-schools.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref> When Langdell developed the original law school curriculum, Harvard University President [[Charles William Eliot|Charles Eliot]] told him to make it "hard and long."<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://paulcarrington.com/Harvard%20Law%20School%20Oral%20History.htm]  {{wayback|url=http://paulcarrington.com/Harvard%20Law%20School%20Oral%20History.htm |date=20120218062635 }}</ref><ref name="autogenerated3">[http://paulcarrington.com/Learning%20Law%20in%20New%20Haven.htm]  {{wayback|url=http://paulcarrington.com/Learning%20Law%20in%20New%20Haven.htm |date=20120218062629 }}</ref> The school's competitive culture gave rise to the urban legend of a dean at the school telling incoming students, "Look to your left, look to your right, because one of you won't be here by the end of the year."<ref>{{Citation |first=Richard D. |last=Kahlenberg |title=Broken Contract: A Memoir of Harvard Law School |year=1992 |location=New York |publisher=Hill and Wang |isbn=0-8090-3165-5 }}</ref> [[Scott Turow]]'s memoir ''[[One L]]'' and [[John Jay Osborn, Jr.|John Jay Osborn]]'s novel ''[[The Paper Chase (novel)|The Paper Chase]]'' describe such an environment.

In addition, Eleanor Kerlow's book ''Poisoned Ivy: How Egos, Ideology, and Power Politics Almost Ruined Harvard Law School'' criticized the school for a 1980s political dispute between newer and older faculty members over accusations of insensitivity to minority and feminist issues. Divisiveness over such issues as [[political correctness]] lent the school the title "Beirut on the Charles."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legaled.com/revolution.htm |title=www |publisher=Legaled.com |date=2003-09-21 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref>

In ''Broken Contract: A Memoir of Harvard Law School,'' Richard Kahlenberg criticized the school for driving students away from public interest and toward work in high-paying law firms. Kahlenberg's criticisms are supported by Granfield and Koenig's study, which found that "students [are directed] toward service in the most prestigious law firms, both because they learn that such positions are their destiny and because the recruitment network that results from collective eminence makes these jobs extremely easy to obtain."<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The school has also been criticized for its large first year class sizes (at one point there were 140 students per classroom; in 2001 there were 80), a cold and aloof administration,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4D71131F935A25757C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=Harvard Law Tries to Increase Appeal | first=Jonathan D. | last=Glater | date=April 16, 2001 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> and an inaccessible faculty. The latter stereotype is a central plot element of ''The Paper Chase'' and appears in ''[[Legally Blonde]]''.

In response to the above criticisms, HLS eventually implemented the once-criticized<ref name="autogenerated3" /> but now dominant approach pioneered by Dean [[Robert Hutchins]] at [[Yale Law School]], of shifting the competitiveness to the admissions process while making law school itself a more cooperative experience. Robert Granfield and Thomas Koenig's 1992 study of Harvard Law students that appeared in ''The Sociological Quarterly'' found that students "learn to cooperate with rather than compete against classmates," and that contrary to "less eminent" law schools, students "learn that professional success is available for all who attend, and that therefore, only neurotic 'gunners' try to outdo peers."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Citation |first=Robert |last=Granfield |first2=Thomas |last2=Koenig |year=2005 |title=Learning Collective Eminence: Harvard Law School and the Social Production of Elite Lawyers |journal=Sociological Quarterly |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=503–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1992.tb00140.x }}</ref>

===21st century===
[[Image:Dean Kagan.jpg|thumb|left|Elena Kagan]]
[[File:1 martha minow commencement 2010 harvard.JPG|thumb|right|Martha Minow]]
Under Kagan, the second half of the 2000s saw significant academic changes since the implementation of the Langdell curriculum. In 2006, the faculty voted unanimously to approve a new first-year curriculum, placing greater emphasis on problem-solving, administrative law, and international law. The new curriculum was implemented in stages over the next several years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/bulletin/2008/winter/feature_1.php |title=Issues Archive &#124; Harvard Law Today |publisher=Law.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/07/education/07harvard.html | work=The New York Times | title=Harvard Law Decides to Steep Students in 21st-Century Issues | first=Jonathan D. | last=Glater | date=October 7, 2006 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}</ref> with the last new course, a first year practice-oriented problem solving workshop, being instituted in January 2010. In late 2008, the faculty decided that the school should move to an Honors/Pass/Low Pass (H/P/LP) grading system, much like those in place at Yale and Stanford Law Schools. The system applied to half the courses taken by students in the Class of 2010 and fully started with the Class of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mystal |first=Elie |url=http://abovethelaw.com/2008/10/hls-grade-reform-splitting-the-baby-was-the-only-call/ |title=HLS Grade Reform: Splitting the Baby Was The Only Call |publisher=Above the Law |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref>

In 2009, Kagan was appointed [[Solicitor General of the United States|solicitor general of the United States]] by President [[Barack Obama]] and resigned the deanship. On June 11, 2009, Harvard University president, [[Drew Gilpin Faust]] named [[Martha Minow]] as the new dean. She assumed the position on July 1, 2009.

HLS is currently ranked second by the [[U.S. News & World Report|U.S. News & World and Report]], behind only [[Yale Law School]]. Its acceptance rate was 15.4% in the 2013–14 admissions cycle, and its [[yield (college admissions)|yield rate]] of 66.2% was the second-highest of any [[law school in the United States]].<ref name="HLS Profile and Facts"/><ref name="US News"/>

==''Harvard Law Review'', other journals==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Students of the [[Juris Doctor]] (JD) program are involved in preparing and publishing the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', one of the most highly cited university [[law review]]s, as well as a number of other law journals and an independent student newspaper. The ''Harvard Law Review'' was first published in 1887 and has been staffed and edited by some of the school's most notable alumni.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harvardlawreview.org/hlr_497.php |title=The Harvard Law Review — Glimpses of Its History as Seen by an Aficionado – The Harvard Law Review — Glimpses of Its History as Seen by an Aficionado |publisher=Harvardlawreview.org |date=1987-01-17 |accessdate=2015-03-10}}</ref> In addition to the journal, the Harvard Law Review Association also publishes ''[[Bluebook|The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation]]'', the most widely followed authority for legal citation formats in the United States. The [[student newspaper]], the ''[[Harvard Law Record]]'', has been published continuously since the 1940s, making it one of the oldest law school newspapers in the country, and has included the exploits of fictional law student Fenno for decades. The Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance and Financial Regulation, formerly known as the ''Harvard Law School Corporate Governance Blog'', is one of the most widely read law websites in the country.

The law journals are:
* ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''

==Shield retirement==
[[File:Harvard Law School shield.svg|150px|thumb|upright|Former Harvard Law School shield, retired in 2016]]
In 2016, the governing body of the university, the [[Harvard Corporation]], voted to retire the law school's 80 year old shield. The shield, based in part upon the [[family crest]] of Isaac Royall Jr, a university benefactor who had endowed the first professorship in the law school, had become a source of contention among a group of law school students. The shield depicted three wheat sheaves, reflecting the Royall family's history as slave-owners.<ref>[https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/03/14/harvard-law-school-ditch-controversial-shield-with-elements-from-slave-owning-family/UIYgbyviFdwwGKjexZgWqN/story.html Harvard Law School to ditch controversial shield] Steve Annear.

===Books===
''[[The Paper Chase (novel)|The Paper Chase]]'' is a novel set amid a student's first ("One L") year at the school. It was written by [[John Jay Osborn, Jr.]], who studied at the school. The book was later turned into a film and a television series (see below).

[[Scott Turow]] wrote a memoir of his experience as a first-year law student at Harvard, ''[[One L]]''.

===Film and television===
Several movies and television shows take place at least in part at the school. Most of them have scenes filmed on location at or around Harvard University. They include:
* ''[[Love Story (1970 film)|Love Story]]'' (1970)
* ''[[The Paper Chase (film)|The Paper Chase]]'' (1973)
* ''[[The Paper Chase (TV series)|The Paper Chase]]'' (1978–1979, 1983–1986 television series)
* ''[[Soul Man (film)|Soul Man]]'' (1986)
* ''[[The Firm (1993 film)|The Firm]]'' (1993)
