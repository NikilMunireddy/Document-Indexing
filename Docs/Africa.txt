==Etymology==
[[File:Palazzo Ferreria statue 2.jpeg|thumb|Statue representing Africa at [[Palazzo Ferreria]], in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]]]
''[[Afri]]'' was a [[Latin]] name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean ([[Ancient Libya]]).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Georges|first1=Karl Ernst|editor1-last=Georges|editor1-first=Heinrich|encyclopedia=Ausführliches lateinisch-deutsches Handwörterbuch|date=1913–1918|location=Hannover|edition=8th|url=http://latin_german.deacademic.com/1644|accessdate=20 September 2015|language=German|title=Afri}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|date=1879|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DAfer|accessdate=20 September 2015|title=Afer}}</ref> This name seems to have originally referred to a native [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] tribe; see [[Terence#Biography]] for discussion. The name is usually connected with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''ʿafar'' "dust", but a 1981 hypothesis<ref>[http://michel-desfayes.org/namesofcountries.html Names of countries], Decret and Fantar, 1981</ref> has asserted that it stems from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] ''ifri'' (plural ''ifran'') "cave", in reference to cave dwellers.<ref name="Michell">[http://www.jstor.org/pss/714549 Geo. Babington Michell, "The Berbers"], ''Journal of Royal African Society'', Vol. 2, No. 6 (January 1903), pp. 161-194.</ref> The same word<ref name=Michell/> may be found in the name of the [[Banu Ifran]] from [[Algeria]] and [[Tripolitania]], a [[Berber people|Berber]] tribe originally from [[Yafran]] (also known as ''Ifrane'') in northwestern Libya.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&pg=PA200 Edward Lipinski, ''Itineraria Phoenicia''], Peeters Publishers, 2004, p. 200.

Under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of [[Africa Proconsularis]], which also included the coastal part of modern [[Libya]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consultsos.com/pandora/africa.htm|title=Consultos.com etymology}}</ref> The Latin suffix "[[wikt:-ica#Latin|-ica]]" can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in ''[[Celtica]]'' from ''[[Celts|Celtae]]'', as used by [[Julius Caesar]]). The later Muslim kingdom of [[Ifriqiya]], modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.

According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while "Asia" was used to refer to [[Anatolia]] and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer [[Ptolemy]] (85–165 AD), indicating [[Alexandria]] along the [[Prime Meridian]] and making the isthmus of Suez and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of "Africa" expanded with their knowledge.

Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name "Africa":
* The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (''Ant. 1.15'') asserted that it was named for [[Epher]], grandson of [[Abraham]] according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
* [[Isidore of Seville]] in ''[[Etymologiae]]'' XIV.5.2. suggests "Africa comes from the [[Latin]] ''aprica'', meaning "sunny".
* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian ''af-rui-ka'', meaning "to turn toward the opening of the Ka." The [[Egyptian soul#Ka|Ka]] is the energetic double of every person and the "opening of the Ka" refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, "the birthplace."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_nile_genesis.htm|title='Nile Genesis: the opus of Gerald Massey'|publisher=Gerald-massey.org.uk|date=29 October 1907|accessdate=18 May 2010}}</ref>
* Michèle Fruyt proposed<ref>in ''Revue de Philologie'' 50, 1976: pp. 221–238.</ref> linking the Latin word with ''africus'' "south wind", which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally "rainy wind".
* Robert R. Stieglitz of [[Rutgers University]] proposed: "The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew [[Ophir]]."<ref>"Long-Distance Seafaring in the Ancient Near East." Robert R. Stieglitz. ''The Biblical Archaeologist'', Vol. 47, No. 3 (September 1984)</ref>

Africa is considered by most [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to be the [[cradle of Humankind|oldest inhabited territory]] on [[Earth]], with the [[Human|human species]] originating from the continent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1058484.stm Genetic study roots humans in Africa], BBC News, SCI/TECH</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070828155004.htm Migration of Early Humans From Africa Aided By Wet Weather], sciencedaily.com</ref> During the mid-20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] discovered many [[fossil]]s and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BP=before present).

Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in [[Southern Africa]], [[Southeast Africa]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Sahara]].<ref>Candice Goucher et al., World History: Journeys from Past to Present (2013), pp. 2-20 [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1134723547]</ref>

Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.<ref>[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht "Sahara's Abrupt Desertification Started by Changes in Earth's Orbit, Accelerated by Atmospheric and Vegetation Feedbacks"], ''Science Daily''</ref> The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Second Cataract]] where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]]. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in [[Ethiopia]].

The domestication of [[cattle]] in Africa preceded [[agriculture]] and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.<ref>Diamond, Jared. (1999) "Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York:Norton, p. 167</ref> In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the [[donkey]] and a small screw-horned goat which was common from [[Algeria]] to [[Nubia]].

Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.<ref name="O'Brien">O'Brien, Patrick K. (General Editor). ''Oxford Atlas of World History''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 22–23</ref> This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of [[West Africa]].<ref name="O'Brien"/>

By the first millennium BC, [[Ferrous metallurgy|ironworking]] had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,<ref>[http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm#Irontechnology Martin and O'Meara, "Africa, 3rd Ed."] Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1995</ref> and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. [[Copper]] objects from [[Egypt]], North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that [[Trans-Saharan trade]] networks had been established by this date.<ref name="O'Brien"/>

Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the [[Roman Empire]], the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. [[Africa Province|Roman settlement]] occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast.

In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic [[Caliphate]] expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic center of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to [[Qayrawan]] in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.<ref name =Ayoub>{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud M.|authorlink=Mahmoud M.

These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the [[San people]] of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Bantu peoples|peoples]] of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the [[Horn of Africa]]; the large [[Sahelian kingdoms]]; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the [[Akan people|Akan]]; [[Benin Empire|Edo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo people]] in [[West Africa]]; and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coastal trading towns of [[Southeast Africa]].

By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan. The most powerful of these states were [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Gao]], and the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu Empire]].  Ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the [[Mali Empire]] which consolidated much of western Sudan in the thirteenth century. Kanem accepted Islam in the eleventh century.

In the forested regions of the West African coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the [[Islam|Muslim]] north. The [[Kingdom of Nri]] was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. It is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day [[Nigeria]] and was ruled by the [[Eze Nri]].

The [[Ife|Kingdom of Ife]], historically the first of these Yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly [[oba (ruler)|oba]] ('king' or 'ruler' in the [[Yoruba language]]), called the ''Ooni of Ife''.  Ife was noted as a major religious and cultural center in West Africa, and for its unique naturalistic tradition of bronze sculpture.  The Ife model of government was adapted at the [[Oyo Empire]], where its obas or kings, called the ''Alaafins of Oyo'', once controlled a large number of other Yoruba and non-Yoruba city-states and kingdoms; the [[Fon people|Fon]] ''Kingdom of [[Dahomey]]'' was one of the non-Yoruba domains under Oyo control.

Following the breakup of Mali, a local leader named [[Sonni Ali]] (1464–1492) founded the [[Songhai Empire]] in the region of middle [[Niger]] and the western [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]] and took control of the trans-Saharan trade. Sonni Ali seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[Djenné|Jenne]] in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor [[Askia Mohammad I]] (1493–1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.<ref name="multiple">Ira M.

In [[West Africa]], the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the [[New World]], increasing [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] legislation in Europe and America, and the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy's]] increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Jo Loosemore, Sailing against slavery].

Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against "the usurping King of [[Lagos]]", deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS|title=The West African Squadron and slave trade|publisher=Pdavis.nl|accessdate=18 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610030306/http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm|archivedate=10 June 2010|deadurl=no}}</ref> The largest powers of West Africa (the [[Asante Confederacy]], the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]], and the [[Oyo Empire]]) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift.

In the late 19th century, the European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: [[Ethiopia]] (known to Europeans as "Abyssinia"), and [[Liberia]]. [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt <!-- the fate of Sudan and its administrative status under British rule differed from those of Egypt -->was effectively under British administration [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|until 1922]].

===Berlin Conference===
The [[Berlin Conference]] held in 1884–85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. It sought to end the Eurpoean powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.

===Independence struggles===
Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of [[World War II]], when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. [[African independence movements|Independence movements in Africa]] gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, [[Libya]], a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] won their independence from France.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ltzav890zpIC&pg=PA118&dq=tunisia+morocco+independance+1956#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Lucien Bély, ''History of France''.

Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.

Portugal's overseas presence in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], Cape Verde, [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea-Bissau]] and São Tomé and Príncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was overthrown in [[Carnation Revolution|a military coup in Lisbon]]. [[Rhodesia]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, under the [[White minority rule|white minority]] government of [[Ian Smith]], but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as [[Zimbabwe]]) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a [[Rhodesian Bush War|bitter guerrilla war]]. Although [[South Africa]] was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] until 1994.

===Post-colonial Africa===
[[File:Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], [[Zaire]]'s longtime dictator, [[Embezzlement|embezzled]] over $5 billion from his country.]]
Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African states are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of [[Coup d'état|coups]], producing [[military dictatorship]]s.

Great instability was mainly the result of [[Ethnic nepotism|marginalization of ethnic groups]], and [[Political corruption|graft under these leaders]]. For [[Divide and rule|political gain]], many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the [[Armed forces|military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.
[[File:SADF-Operations 4.jpg|thumb|South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the [[South African Border War]]]]
[[Cold War]] conflicts between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], as well as the policies of the [[International Monetary Fund]],{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In [[Rhodesia]], Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwe Patriotic Front]] waged a brutal [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] against the country's white government. There was a [[1983–85 famine in Ethiopia|major famine in Ethiopia]], when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/703958.stm|title=BBC: 1984 famine in Ethiopia|date=6 April 2000|accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref><ref>Robert G.

Another notable tragic event is the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS in post-colonial Africa]] has also been a prevalent issue.

In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war in Angola]] came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from [[China]],<ref name=Africa/> which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as [[Africa Rising]], can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.<ref>Jenny Aker, Isaac Mbiti, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1693963 "Mobile Phones and Economic Development in Africa"] SSRN</ref>

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Africa}}
[[File:Africa map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Africa map of Köppen climate classification]]
The climate of Africa ranges from [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subarctic]] on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily [[desert]], or [[arid]], while its central and southern areas contain both [[savanna]] plains and dense [[jungle]] ([[rainforest]]) regions.

[[File:Zebras, Serengeti savana plains, Tanzania.jpg|left|thumb|Savanna at [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Tanzania]]]]
Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and "range of freedom" of [[wild animal]] populations and diversity, with wild populations of large [[carnivore]]s (such as [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s) and [[herbivore]]s (such as [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[elephant]]s, [[camel]]s, and [[giraffe]]s) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of "jungle" animals including [[snake]]s and [[primate]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]] such as [[crocodile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. In addition, Africa has the largest number of [[megafauna]] species, as it was least affected by the [[Quaternary extinction event#The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event|extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna]].

There are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (former [[Zaire]]), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighboring African countries became involved (see also [[Second Congo War]]). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.

===The African Union===
[[File:Map of the African Union with Suspended States.svg|thumb|upright|Map of the African Union with suspended states highlighted in light green]]
{{Main|African Union}}
The [[African Union]] (AU) is a 54-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states except [[Morocco]]. The union was formed, with [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002<ref name="African Union 2002">{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_&_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union,%209%20July%202002.htm|title=Launch of the African Union, 9 July 2002: Address by the chairperson of the AU, President Thabo Mbeki|author=Thabo Mbeki|date=9 July 2002|publisher=africa-union.org|location=ABSA Stadium, Durban, South Africa|accessdate=8 February 2009}}</ref> as a successor to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) was relocated to [[Midrand]], in South Africa, but the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.

The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]], which aims to transform the [[African Economic Community]], a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [[Assembly of the African Union|African Union Government]], consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the [[Pan-African Parliament]]. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the [[Pan-African Parliament|Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament]], as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the [[OAU]] Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.

Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[Côte d'Ivoire]].

Although it has abundant [[natural resource]]s, Africa remains the world's poorest and most [[Human Development Index|underdeveloped]] continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corrupt governments]] that have often committed serious [[human rights violations]], failed [[central planning]], high levels of [[illiteracy]], lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from [[guerrilla warfare]] to [[genocide]]).<ref>Richard Sandbrook, ''The Politics of Africa's Economic Stagnation'', Cambridge University Press, 1985 passim</ref> According to the [[United Nations]]' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 25 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.<ref>[http://hdr.undp.org/], United Nations</ref>

Speakers of [[Bantu languages]] (part of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from [[The Sahel]] progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>Luc-Normand Tellier (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&pg=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Urban world history: an economic and geographical perspective]''. PUQ. p. 204. ISBN 2-7605-1588-5</ref> But there are also several [[Nilotic]] groups in [[South Sudan]] and East Africa, the mixed [[Swahili people]] on the [[Swahili Coast]], and a few remaining [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] Khoisan ("[[Bushmen|San"]] or "Bushmen") and [[Pygmy peoples]] in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also "San", closely related to, but distinct from "[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]") have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article402970.ece Pygmies struggle to survive in war zone where abuse is routine]. ''Times'' Online. 16 December 2004</ref>

The peoples of West Africa primarily speak [[Niger–Congo languages]], belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some [[Nilo-Saharan]] and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Niger–Congo-speaking [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Fulani]], [[Akan language|Akan]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] or [[Mande languages|Mande]] groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the [[Hausa language|Hausa]], are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Zarma people|Zarma]], are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering [[Central Africa]].

The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The [[Arab]]s who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the [[Arabic language]] and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns (who founded [[Carthage]]) and [[Hyksos]], the Indo-Iranian [[Alans]], the Indo- European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Vandals]] settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.<ref>{{cite news|title=Q&A: The Berbers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 March 2004}}</ref> The Berber-speaking [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and other often-[[nomad]]ic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Niger–Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Bedscha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beja people|Beja]] [[bedouin]]s from Northeast Africa]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], some Ethiopian and [[Eritrea]]n groups (like the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrayans]], collectively known as [[Habesha people|Habesha]]) speak languages from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family, while the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] speak languages from the [[Cushitic]] branch of Afro-Asiatic.

European colonization also brought sizable groups of [[Asian people|Asians]], particularly from the [[Indian subcontinent]], to British colonies. Large [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian communities]] are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large [[Indians in Uganda|Indian community in Uganda]] was [[expulsion of Asians from Uganda|expelled]] by the dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] are an [[Austronesian people]], but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as [[Cape Coloureds]] (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of [[Demographics of Lebanon#The Lebanese Diaspora|Lebanese]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]<ref name="Africa"/> have also developed in the larger coastal cities of [[West Africa|West]] and [[East Africa]], respectively.<ref>[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-07-10-voa46.html Naomi Schwarz, "Lebanese Immigrants Boost West African Commerce"], VOANews.com, 10 July 2007</ref>

Africa is the most [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major [[language family|language families]] indigenous to Africa:
* The [[Afroasiatic languages|''Afroasiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the [[Horn of Africa]], [[North Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[Niger–Congo languages|''Niger–Congo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages.
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about fifty and are spoken in [[Southern Africa]] by approximately 120,000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.

Following the end of [[colonialism]], nearly all African countries adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]). In numerous countries, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (''see [[African French]]'') are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. [[Italian language|Italian]] is spoken by some in former [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian colonies]] in Africa. [[German language|German]] is spoken in [[Namibia]], as it was a former [[Germany|German]] protectorate.

Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practiced in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.<ref name="pearsonhighered.com">[http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf]</ref> Leopold II of Belgium attempted to "civilize" Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.<ref name="pearsonhighered.com"/>

The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of [[Afrobeat]] and [[Highlife]] music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of [[North Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. [[Arab]] influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, [[Western culture#Widespread influence|Western influences]] are apparent due to [[colonization]].

===Sports===
Fifty-three African countries have [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in the [[Confederation of African Football]]. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent [[FIFA World Cup]]s. [[South Africa]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup tournament]], becoming the first African country to do so.

[[Cricket]] is popular in some African nations. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] have [[Test cricket|Test]] status, while [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] is the leading non-test team and previously had [[One Day International|One-Day International cricket]] (ODI) status (from [[President's Cup 1997-98|10 October 1997]], until [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier#Super Six|30 January 2014]]). The three countries jointly hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. [[Morocco]] in northern Africa has also hosted the [[2002 Morocco Cup]], but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. [[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Africa}}
Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive a topic for governments with mixed religious populations.<ref name=stanford>[http://library.stanford.edu/africa/religion.html "African Religion on the Internet"], [[Stanford University]]</ref><ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EEDC1030F932A35752C1A9679C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1|date=1 November 2001|title=Rising Muslim Power in Africa Causing Unrest in Nigeria and Elsewhere|first=Normitsu|last=Onishi|work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 March 2009}}</ref> According to the [[World Book Encyclopedia]], [[Islam in Africa|Islam]] is the largest religion in Africa, followed by [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]]. According to [[Encyclopedia Britannica]], 45% of the population are [[Christian]]s, 40% are [[Muslim]]s, and 10% follow [[African Traditional Religion|traditional religions]]. A small number of Africans are [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[Confucianist]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Baha'i]], or have beliefs from the [[Judaism in Africa|Judaic tradition]]. There is also a minority of Africans who are [[Irreligion in Africa|irreligious]].
