[[File:Sarayi Album 10a.jpg|thumb|150px|Sultan [[Mehmed II]] is considered one of the most famous [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman Sultans|sultans]].]]
'''Sultan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ʌ|l|t|ən}}; {{lang-ar|سلطان}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sulṭān}}'', {{IPA-ar|sʊlˈtˤɑːn, solˈtˤɑːn|pron}}) is a [[Royal and noble ranks|noble title]] with several historical meanings. Originally, it was an Arabic [[abstract noun]] meaning "strength", "authority", "rulership", derived from the [[verbal noun]] {{lang|ar|سلطة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|sulṭah}}'', meaning "authority" or "power". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain rulers who claimed almost full sovereignty in practical terms (i.e., the lack of dependence on any higher ruler), albeit without claiming the overall [[caliphate]], or to refer to a powerful [[governor]] of a province within the caliphate. 

The [[dynasty]] and lands ruled by a sultan are referred to as a '''sultanate''' ({{lang|ar|سلطنة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|salṭanah}}''<span style="margin-left:2px">)</span>.

A feminine form of ''sultan'', used by Westerners, is [[Sultana (title)|''sultana'']] or ''sultanah''; however, this styling misconstrues the roles of wives of sultans. In a similar usage, the wife of a German [[field marshal]] might be styled ''Frau Feldmarschall'' (in French, similar constructions of the type ''madame la maréchale'' are quite common). The rare female leaders in [[Muslim history]] are correctly known as "sultanas". However, the wife of the sultan in the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] is styled as the "panguian" and sultan's chief wife in many sultanate in [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]] is known as "permaisuri". Special case in [[Brunei]], the [[Queen Consort]] is known as ''Pengiran Isteri'' with suffix ''Pengiran Anak'' if the queen consort is a royal princess.

Among those modern hereditary rulers who wish to emphasize their secular authority under the [[rule of law]], the term is gradually being replaced by [[king]] (i.e. ''[[malik]]'' in Arabic) and ''[[Datu]]'' in [[Maranao language|Maranao]].

==Compound ruler titles==
[[File:Ralamb-2.jpg|thumb|150px|Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed IV]] attended by a eunuch and two pages.]]
These are generally secondary titles, either lofty 'poetry' or with a message, e.g.:
*''Mani Sultan'' = ''Manney Sultan'' (meaning the "Pearl of Rulers" or "Honoured Monarch") - a subsidiary title, part of the full style of the [[Maharaja]] of [[Travancore]]
* ''[[Sultan of Sultans]]'' - the sultanic equivalent of the style [[King of Kings]]
* Certain secondary titles have a devout Islamic connotation; e.g., [[Sultan ul-Mujahidin]] as champion of [[jihad]] (to strive and to struggle in the name of Allah).
* ''Sultanic Highness'' - a rare, hybrid western-Islamic honorific style exclusively used by the son, daughter-in-law and daughters of Sultan [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] of [[Egypt]] (a British [[protectorate]] since 1914), who bore it with their primary titles of [[Prince]] (''{{transl|ar|[[Amir]]}}''; {{Lang-tr|[[Prens]]}}) or [[Princess]], after 11 October 1917. They enjoyed these titles for life, even after the Royal Rescript regulating the styles and titles of the Royal House following Egypt's [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|independence in 1922]], when the sons and daughters of the newly styled king (''{{transl|ar|[[malik]] Misr}}'', considered a promotion) were granted the title ''Sahib(at) us-Sumuw al-Malaki'', or [[Royal Highness]].

==Princely and aristocratic titles==
[[File:The Sultan Valide.jpg|thumb|150px|The [[Valide Sultan]] (Empress mother) of the [[Ottoman Empire]] ]]
By the beginning of the 16th century, title sultan carried by both men's and women's of the Ottoman dynasty, was replacing other titles by which prominent members of the imperial family had been known (notably ''khatun'' for women and ''bey'' for men). This usage underlines the Ottoman conception of sovereign power as family prerogative.

Western tradition knows the Ottoman ruler as "sultan", but Ottomans themselves used "padişah" (emperor) or "hünkar" to refer to their ruler. The emperor’s formal title consisted of "sultan" together with "khan" (for example, Sultan Suleiman Khan). In formal address, the sultan’s children were also entitled "sultan", with imperial princes (Şehzade) carrying the title before their given name, with imperial princesses carrying it after. Example, [[Şehzade Mehmed|Şehzade Sultan Mehmed]] and [[Mihrimah Sultan]], son and daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent. Like imperial princesses, living mother and main consort of reigning sultan also carried the title after their given names, for example, [[Ayşe Hafsa Sultan]], Suleiman’s mother and first [[valide sultan]], and [[Roxelana|Hürrem Sultan]], Suleiman’s chief consort and first [[haseki sultan]]. The evolving usage of this title reflected power shifts among imperial women, especially between [[Sultanate of Women]], as the position of main consort eroded over the course of 17th century, the main consort lost the title "sultan", which replaced by "kadin", a title related to the earlier "khatun". Henceforth, the mother of the reigning sultan was the only person of non imperial blood to carry the title "sultan".<ref>{{cite book |title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire |last=Peirce |first=Leslie P. |publicationplace=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-507673-7 |location= |pages=}}</ref>

In [[Kazakh Khanate]] a Sultan was a lord from the ruling dynasty (a direct descendants of [[Genghis Khan]])  elected by clans, i.e. a kind of princes{{cn|date=February 2016}}. The best of sultans was elected as [[khan (title)|khan]] by people at [[Kurultai]]{{cn|date=February 2016}}.

==Military rank==
In a number of post-caliphal states under [[Mongol]] or [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] rule, there was a [[Feudalism|feudal]] type of military hierarchy. These administrations were often decimal (mainly in larger empires), using originally princely titles such as [[Khan (title)|khan]], [[malik]], [[amir]] as mere rank denominations.

In the [[Persian empire]], the rank of sultan was roughly equivalent to that of a modern-day [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] in the West; socially in the fifth-rank class, styled 'Ali Jah.
