The original '''American Basketball Association''' ('''ABA''')  was a major-league professional [[basketball]] league founded in 1967. The ABA ceased to exist with the [[ABA–NBA merger]] in 1976.

== League history ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
The original ABA was founded in 1967, competing with the well-established [[National Basketball Association]], until the ABA–NBA merger in 1976. According to one of the owners of the Indiana Pacers, its goal was to force a merger with the more established league.  Potential investors were told that they could get an ABA team for half of what it cost to get an NBA expansion team at the time. When the merger occurred, ABA officials said their investment would more than double.<ref name=encyc>{{cite book |title=The Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia |publisher=Villard Books |year=1994 |isbn=0-679-43293-0 |page=180}}</ref>

Four ABA teams were absorbed into the older league: the [[Brooklyn Nets|New York Nets]], [[Denver Nuggets]], [[Indiana Pacers]], and [[San Antonio Spurs]]. Two other clubs, the [[Kentucky Colonels]], and the [[Spirits of St. Louis]], were disbanded upon the merger. A third, the [[Virginia Squires]], had folded less than a month earlier, missing out on the opportunities that a merger might have provided.

The ABA distinguished itself from its older counterpart with a more wide-open, flashy style of offensive play, as well as differences in rules—a 30-second [[shot clock]] (as opposed to the NBA's 24-second clock, though the ABA did switch to the 24 second shot clock for the 1975–76 season) and use of a [[three-point field goal]] [[Arc (geometry)|arc]]. Also, the ABA used a colorful red, white and blue ball, instead of the NBA's traditional orange ball. The ABA also had several "regional" franchises, such as the Virginia Squires and [[Carolina Cougars]], that played "home" games in several cities.

The ABA also went after four of the best referees in the NBA: [[Earl Strom]], [[John Vanak]], [[Norm Drucker]] and [[Joe Gushue]], getting them to "jump" leagues by offering them far more in money and benefits. In Earl Strom's memoir ''Calling the Shots'', Strom conveys both the heady sense of being courted by a rival league with money to burn—and also the depression that set in the next year when he began refereeing in the ABA, with less prominent players performing in inadequate arenas, in front of very small crowds. Nevertheless, the emergence of the ABA boosted the salaries of referees just as it did the salaries of players.

The freewheeling style of the ABA eventually caught on with fans, but the lack of a national [[television]] contract and protracted financial losses would spell doom for the ABA as an independent circuit. In 1976, its last year of existence, the ABA pioneered the now-popular [[slam dunk contest]] at its [[all-star game]] in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]].

One of the more significant long-term contributions of the ABA to professional basketball was to tap into markets in the southeast that had been collegiate basketball hotbeds (including North Carolina, Virginia, and Kentucky). The NBA was focused on the urban areas of the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast. At the time, it showed no interest in placing a team south of Washington, D.C.

=== Commissioners ===
* [[George Mikan]] 1967–1969
* [[James Carson Gardner]] 1969 ([[interim]])<ref>[http://sportsecyclopedia.com/aba/carolina/cougars.html Sports Encyclopedia]</ref>
* Jack Dolph 1969–1972
* Bob Carlson 1972–1973
* [[Mike Storen]] 1973–74
* Tedd Munchak 1974–75
* [[Dave DeBusschere]] 1975–76

NBA great [[George Mikan]] was the first commissioner of the ABA, where he introduced both the 3-point line and the league's [[trademark]] red, white and blue basketball.<ref name=espn>{{cite web |title=ESPN Classic: Mikan was first pro to dominate the post |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/obit/s/2005/0602/2074322.html |accessdate=2007-12-04}}</ref> Mikan resigned in 1969. [[Dave DeBusschere]], one of the stars of the New York Knicks championship teams, moved from his job as Vice President and GM of the ABA's New York Nets in 1975 to become the last commissioner of the ABA and facilitate the ABA–NBA merger in 1976.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/debusschere_bio.html |title=Dave DeBusschere Bio |accessdate=2008-03-09 |publisher=[[National Basketball Association|NBA.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411151339/http://www.nba.com/history/players/debusschere_bio.html|archivedate=11 April 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

==Teams==
Of the original 11 teams, only the [[Kentucky Colonels]] and [[Indiana Pacers]] remained for all nine seasons without relocating, changing team names, or folding. However, the [[Denver Nuggets|Denver Larks/Rockets/Nuggets]], a team that had been [[Kansas City (ABA)|assigned]] to [[Kansas City, Missouri]], moved to [[Denver]] without playing a game in Kansas City due to the lack of a suitable arena.  In addition to the four surviving ABA teams, eight current NBA markets have ABA heritage: Utah, Dallas, Houston, Miami, Minnesota, New Orleans, Memphis, and Charlotte all had an ABA team before the NBA arrived. The Louisville, Kentucky-Indiana market, former home of the ABA Kentucky Colonels, is considered a top contender for the next NBA expansion or relocation, and in fact the then [[Vancouver Grizzlies]] had [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] as one of its four "finalists" for a new home before choosing [[Memphis]] in 2001. The Colonels led the ABA in attendance five of the ABA's nine seasons, with regular sellouts of 16,600+ fans at Louisville's Freedom Hall, since replaced by the 22,000-seat [[KFC Yum! Center]].<ref>Official ABA Guides, 1967-1976.</ref>

==Succession==
In 1999, a new league calling itself the [[American Basketball Association (2000–)|ABA 2000]] was established.  The new league uses a similar red, white and blue basketball as the old ABA, but unlike the original ABA, it does not feature players of the same caliber as the NBA, nor does it play games in major arenas nor on television as the original ABA did.
