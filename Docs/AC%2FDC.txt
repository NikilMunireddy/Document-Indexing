'''AC/DC''' are<!-- DO ''not'' CHANGE to 'is'.

AC/DC underwent several line-up changes before releasing their first album, ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]'', on 17 February 1975; Malcolm and Angus were the only original members left in the band. Membership subsequently stabilised until bassist [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]] was replaced by [[Cliff Williams]] in 1977 for the album ''[[Powerage]]''. Within months of recording the album ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', lead singer and co-songwriter [[Bon Scott]] died on 19 February 1980 after a night of heavy alcohol consumption. The group considered disbanding, but buoyed by support from Scott's parents, decided to continue and set about finding a new vocalist.<ref name="hell_aint">{{cite book|first=Mick |last=Wall |title=AC/DC: Hell Aint a Bad Place to Be |publisher=Orion Publishing group |location=London |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-4091-1535-9}}</ref> Ex-[[Geordie (band)|Geordie]] singer [[Brian Johnson]] was auditioned and selected to replace Scott. Later that year, the band released the new album, ''[[Back in Black]]'', which was made as a tribute to Bon Scott. The album launched them to new heights of success and became their all-time best-seller.

The band's next album, ''[[For Those About to Rock We Salute You]]'', was their first album to reach number one in the United States. AC/DC declined in popularity soon after drummer [[Phil Rudd]] was fired in 1983 and was replaced by ex-[[A II Z]] drummer [[Simon Wright (musician)|Simon Wright]], who left to join [[Dio (band)|Dio]] in 1989. The band experienced a resurgence in the early 1990s with the release of ''[[The Razors Edge (AC/DC album)|The Razors Edge]]''. Phil Rudd returned in 1994 after [[Chris Slade]], who was with the band from 1989 to 1994, was asked to leave in favour of him, and contributed to the band's 1995 album ''[[Ballbreaker]]''. ''[[Stiff Upper Lip (album)|Stiff Upper Lip]]'' was released in 2000 and was well received by critics. The band's studio album, ''[[Black Ice (album)|Black Ice]]'', was released on 20 October 2008 and was the second-highest-selling album of that year. It was their biggest hit on the charts since ''For Those About to Rock'', eventually reaching No.1 on all charts worldwide.<ref name="currentstatus">{{cite web |url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.NET/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=95431 |title = AC/DC Completes Recording New Album |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate = 22 April 2008 |date = 22 April 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424091345/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=95431| archivedate=24 April 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref> The band's line-up remained the same—their longest unchanged line-up—until 2014 with Malcolm Young's retirement and Rudd's legal troubles. In 2016, Johnson was advised to stop touring on account of worsening hearing loss. On 16 April 2016, AC/DC announced Johnson was no longer performing with the band and that [[Guns N' Roses]] frontman [[Axl Rose]] would serve as the band's vocalist for the remainder of their 2016 tour dates.

==History==

===Background and name===
Brothers Malcolm, Angus, and [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]] were born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, and moved to Sydney with most of their family in 1963. George was the first to learn to play the guitar. He became a member of [[the Easybeats]], one of Australia's most successful bands of the 1960s. In 1966, they became the first local rock act to have an international hit, with the song "[[Friday on My Mind]]".<ref name="albertmusic">{{cite web |title = History of Albert Music |first = Glenn A. |last = Baker |url = http://www.albertmusic.com/history.htm |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230073123/http://www.albertmusic.com/history.htm |archivedate = 30 December 2007 |work=[[Albert Productions|Albert Music]] |accessdate = 2 August 2008}}</ref> Malcolm followed in George's footsteps by playing with a [[Newcastle, New South Wales]], band called the Velvet Underground (not to be confused with the New York-based [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]]).<ref name="cwalker">{{cite book |title=Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott |year=2001 |isbn=1-891241-13-3 |author=Walker, Clinton |pages=128–133}}</ref> Their oldest brother Alex Young chose to remain in Britain to pursue musical interests. In 1967, Alexander formed and played bass in the London-based band Grapefruit—initially called "The Grapefruit"—with three former members of Tony Rivers and the Castaways, John Perry, Geoff Swettenham, and Pete Swettenham.

[[File:Acdc logo band.svg|thumb|The band's logo was designed in 1977 by [[Gerard Huerta]]. It first appeared on the international version of ''Let There Be Rock''.]]
Malcolm and Angus Young developed the idea for the band's name after their sister, Margaret Young, saw the initials "AC/DC" on a sewing machine. "AC/DC" is an abbreviation meaning "[[alternating current]]/[[direct current]]" electricity. The brothers felt that this name symbolised the band's raw energy, power-driven performances of their music.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://classicrock.about.com/od/artistsae1/p/ac_dc.htm | title = AC/DC | accessdate = 2 August 2008 | last = White | first = Dave | work=[[About.com|About.com&nbsp;– Classic rock]] }}</ref><ref name="acdc.cc">{{cite web | title=AC/DC History | work=AC/DC&nbsp;– Bedlam in Belgium | url=http://www.ac-dc.cc | accessdate = 2 August 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913173941/http://www.ac-dc.cc/| archivedate=13 September 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref> "AC/DC" is pronounced one letter at a time, though the band are colloquially known as "Acca Dacca" in Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/05/16/1084646066908.html |title=Tracker to Acca Dacca |accessdate=18 October 2008 |last=|authorlink=|date=17 May 2004 |work=The Age (theage.com.au) |publisher=Fairfax Digital |location=Melbourne, Australia |language=|archiveurl=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlymelbourne.com.au/melbourne_details.php?id=11169 |title=AC/DC ACDC |accessdate=18 October 2008 |last=|authorlink=|date=1 October 2004 |work=Only Melbourne (onlymelbourne.com.au) |pages=Melbourne, Australia |doi=|archivedate=|quote=Its now rock 'n' roll history after Melbourne discovered acca-dacca so did the rest of the world, going on to become one of the biggest bands in the world. }}</ref> The AC/DC band name is stylised with a [[thunderbolt|lightning bolt]] separating the "AC" and "DC" and has been used on all studio albums, with the exception of the international version of ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]''.<ref name=coverart>{{cite web|title=Album covers for AC/DC|url=http://www.blisshq.com/test/album-covers/AC/DC.html|website=Bliss|publisher=Elsten Software Limited|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref>

===Early years===
In November 1973, Malcolm and Angus Young formed AC/DC and recruited bassist [[Larry Van Kriedt]], vocalist [[Dave Evans (singer)|Dave Evans]], and [[Colin Burgess (musician)|Colin Burgess]], ex-[[The Masters Apprentices|Masters Apprentices]] drummer.<ref>{{cite web | title=Rock Snaps |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | url = http://www.abc.net.au/arts/rocksnaps/photos/s33884.htm | accessdate = 2 August 2008}}</ref> Pushing hard for the band's success were Australia's legendary roadie Ray Arnold and his partner Alan Kissack. [[Gene Pierson]] booked the band to play at Bondi Lifesaver on New Year's Eve, 1973.<ref name="longwaytimeline">{{cite web | title = Long Way to the Top |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | url = http://www.abc.net.au/longway/timeline/ | accessdate = 2 August 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725161207/http://www.abc.net.au/longway/timeline/| archivedate=25 July 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

By this time, Angus Young had adopted his characteristic school-uniform stage outfit. The idea was his sister Margaret's. Angus had tried other costumes: [[Spider-Man]], [[Zorro]], a gorilla, and a parody of [[Superman]], named Super-Ang.<ref name="cwalker" /> In its early days, most members of the band dressed in some form of glam or satin outfit but this approach was abandoned seeing as Melbourne band [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] had already adopted this approach to their stage presentation.

The Young brothers decided that Evans was not a suitable frontman for the group because they felt he was more of a [[glam rock]]er like [[Gary Glitter]].<ref name="paulstenning">{{cite book | last=Stenning | first=Paul |author2=Rob Johnstone |date=November 2005 | title=AC/DC&nbsp;– Two Sides to Every Glory | publisher=Chrome Dreams | isbn=1-84240-308-7 | pages=32–34 }}</ref> On stage, Evans was occasionally replaced by the band's first [[Talent manager|manager]], Dennis Laughlin, who was the original lead singer with [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]] prior to [[Daryl Braithwaite]]. Evans did not get along with Laughlin, which also contributed to the band's ill feeling toward Evans.<ref name="paulstenning" />

===The Bon Scott era (1974–80)===

====The journey begins (1974–77)====
In September 1974, [[Bon Scott|Ronald Belford "Bon" Scott]], an experienced vocalist and friend of George Young, replaced Dave Evans<ref name="Music Legends">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends| url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/dave-evans-interview-acdc/| title=Dave Evans Interview| accessdate=5 May 2013|date=3 January 2013|last=Saulnier|first=Jason}}</ref> after friend [[Vince Lovegrove]] recommended him to George Young.<ref name="hell_aint"/> Like the Young brothers, Scott had been born in Scotland before emigrating to Australia in his childhood. The band had recorded only one single with Evans, "Can I Sit Next To You, Girl" / "Rockin' in the Parlour"; eventually, the song was re-written and re-recorded with Bon Scott as "[[Can I Sit Next to You Girl]]" [Track 7 on the Australian album ''[[T.N.T. (album)|TNT]]'' (1975), and Track 6 on the international release of ''[[High Voltage (1976 album)|High Voltage]]'' (1976)].

<!-- [[Bon Scott#With AC/DC]] links here -->
By October 1974, the Australia-only album ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]'' had been recorded. It took only ten days<ref name="timeline">{{cite web | url = http://www.acdcrocks.com/TIMELINE_index.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070612165328/http://www.acdcrocks.com/TIMELINE_index.html | archivedate = 12 June 2007 | title = Timeline | work=AC/DC official website | accessdate = 2 August 2008}}</ref> and was based on instrumental songs written by the Young brothers, with lyrics added by Scott. Within a few months, the band's line-up had stabilised, featuring Scott, the Young brothers, bassist [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]] and drummer [[Phil Rudd]]. Later that year they released the single "[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)|It's a Long Way to the Top]]", which became their perennial rock anthem.<ref name="acdclane">{{cite news | first = Martin | last = Boulton | title = Laneway to the top for AC/DC | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/09/09/1094530766163.html |work=The Age  | date = 10 September 2004 | accessdate = 2 August 2008 | location=Melbourne}}</ref> It was included on their second album, ''[[T.N.T. (album)|TNT]]'' (1975), which was also released only in Australia and New Zealand. ''T.N.T.'' featured the song "[[High Voltage (song)|High Voltage]]", which was the first song written and recorded for the album. Because "High Voltage" was released as a single before ''T.N.T.'' was released, some people thought it was the title track to AC/DC's debut album.

Between 1974 and 1977, aided by regular appearances on [[Molly Meldrum]]'s ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]'', the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s nationally broadcast pop-music television show, AC/DC became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia. Their performance on 3 April 1977 was their last live TV appearance for more than 20 years.<ref name="timeline" />

====International success (1976–80)====

In 1976, the band signed an international deal with [[Atlantic Records]] and toured extensively throughout Europe, including their first UK tour sponsored by ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine, called the 'Lock Up Your Daughters Summer Tour'. They gained invaluable experience of the stadium circuit, supporting leading rock acts such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], and [[Blue Öyster Cult]], and co-headlined with [[Cheap Trick]].<ref name="timeline" />

The first AC/DC album to gain worldwide distribution was a 1976 compilation of tracks taken from the ''High Voltage'' and ''T.N.T.'' [[LP record|LPs]]. Also titled ''[[High Voltage (1976 album)|High Voltage]]'', and released on the Atlantic Records label, the album, which has to date sold three million copies worldwide,<ref name="BiBBillboard">{{cite web |url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62668/back-in-black-tips-21m-mark |title = ''Back in Black'' tips 21M mark |accessdate = 2 August 2008 |last = Jeckell |first = Barry A. |date = 7 June 2005 |work=Billboard | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623211559/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/62668/back-in-black-tips-21m-mark| archivedate=23 June 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref> gained the band a following among the then-substantial British punk audience.<ref>{{cite web |url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r78|pure_url=yes}} |title = AC/DC&nbsp;– High Voltage |accessdate = 2 August 2008 |first = Steve |last = Huey |work=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref> The track selection was heavily weighted toward the more recent ''T.N.T.'', and included only two songs from their first LP. The band's next album, ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'', was released in the same year in both Australian and international versions, like its predecessor. Track listings varied worldwide, and the international version of the album also featured the ''T.N.T.'' track "Rocker", which had previously never been released internationally. The original Australian version included "[[Jailbreak (AC/DC song)|Jailbreak]]" (now more readily available on the 1984 compilation [[Extended play|EP]] ''[['74 Jailbreak]]'' or as a live version on the 1992 ''[[Live (AC/DC album)|Live]]'' album). ''Dirty Deeds'' was not released in the US until 1981, by which time the band were at the peak of their popularity.

Following the 1977 recording ''[[Let There Be Rock]]'', bassist Mark Evans was fired; purportedly to find someone who could sing backup vocals.<ref name="hell_aint" /> Evans described disagreement with Angus and Malcolm as a contributing factor.<ref name="hell_aint"/> He was replaced by [[Cliff Williams]].<ref name="hell_aint" /> Neither of the Young brothers has elaborated on the departure of Evans, though Richard Griffiths, the CEO of [[Epic Records]] and a booking agent for AC/DC in the mid-1970s, later commented, "You knew Mark wasn't going to last, he was just too much of a nice guy."<ref name="cwalker" /> Mark Evans' autobiography, ''DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC'', released in 2011, predominantly dealt with his time in AC/DC, including being fired.<ref name="BazillionPoints">{{cite web|url=http://www.bazillionpoints.com/dirty-deeds-my-life-insideoutside-of-acdc-by-mark-evans/ |title=DIRTY DEEDS: My Life Inside/Outside of AC/DC, by Mark Evans |publisher=Bazillionpoints.com |date=|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>

AC/DC were a somewhat formative influence on [[new wave of British heavy metal]] bands who emerged in the late 1970s, such as [[Saxon (band)|Saxon]] and [[Iron Maiden]], in part as a reaction to the decline of traditional early 1970s hard rock bands. In 2007, critics noted that AC/DC, along with [[Thin Lizzy]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] and [[Judas Priest]], were among "the second generation of rising stars ready to step into the breach as the old guard waned."<ref>Elliott, Paul. ''"Never Mind the Bollocks"''. [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] (February 2007)</ref>

AC/DC's first American exposure was through the [[Michigan]] radio station AM 600 [[WSNL|WTAC]] in 1977. The station's manager, Peter C. Cavanaugh, booked the band to play at [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]]'s Capitol Theater. The supporting act was [[MC5]], who had just briefly reunited and agreed to play at the event. The band opened with their popular song "[[Live Wire (AC/DC song)|Live Wire]]" and closed with "It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)".<ref>{{cite web |title = Peter Cavanaugh |work=Wild Wednesday |url = http://wildwednesday.com/index.html |accessdate = 2 August 2008}}</ref>

AC/DC came to be identified with the [[punk rock]] movement by the British press. Their reputation, however, managed to survive the punk upheavals of the late 1970s, and they maintained a cult following in the UK throughout this time.<ref name="Bonfire" /> Angus Young gained notoriety for [[mooning]] the audience during live performances.

The 1978 release of ''[[Powerage]]'' marked the debut of bassist Cliff Williams, and with its harder [[riffs]], followed the blueprint set by ''Let There Be Rock''.<ref>{{cite web |url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r81|pure_url=yes}} |title = AC/DC&nbsp;– Powerage |publisher=Allmusic |first = Greg |last = Prato |accessdate = 2 August 2008 }}</ref> Only one single was released from ''Powerage'', "[[Rock 'n' Roll Damnation]]/Sin City". An appearance at the [[The Apollo (Glasgow)|Apollo Theatre, Glasgow]] during the ''Powerage'' tour was recorded and released as ''[[If You Want Blood You've Got It]]'', featuring such songs as "[[Whole Lotta Rosie]]", "Problem Child", and "[[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]", as well as lesser-known album tracks like "[[Riff Raff (song)|Riff Raff]]". ''Powerage'' was the last album produced by [[Harry Vanda]] and [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]] that had lead vocals by [[Bon Scott]], and is claimed to be AC/DC's most under-rated album.<ref name="popmatters">{{cite web |url = http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/a/acdc-reissues2.shtml |title = Epic Records AC/DC Re-issues: Second Wave |accessdate = 2 August 2008 |author=Christopher, Michael |date = 30 June 2003 |work=[[PopMatters]] }}</ref>

The major breakthrough in the band's career came in their collaboration with producer [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange|"Mutt" Lange]] on the album  ''[[Highway to Hell]]'', released in 1979. [[Eddie Van Halen]] notes this to be his favourite AC/DC record, along with ''Powerage''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vhnd.com/2009/06/11/eddie-van-halen-thanks-god-for-sobriety-and-guitar-riffs |title=Eddie Van Halen Thanks God for Sobriety and Guitar Riffs |publisher=vhnd.com |date=11 June 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2015}}</ref> It became the first AC/DC LP to break into the US top 100, eventually reaching No.&nbsp;17,<ref name="timeline" /> and it propelled AC/DC into the top ranks of hard rock acts.<ref name="Bonfire" /> ''Highway to Hell'' had lyrics that shifted away from flippant and comical toward more central rock themes, putting increased emphasis on backing vocals but still featured AC/DC's signature sound: loud, simple, pounding riffs and grooving backbeats.<ref>{{cite web |url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r82|pure_url=yes}} |title = AC/DC&nbsp;– Highway to Hell |publisher=Allmusic |first = Steve |last = Huey |accessdate = 2 August 2008 }}</ref> The final track, "[[Night Prowler (song)|Night Prowler]]", has two breaths in quick succession at the start of the song, intended to create a tone of fear and loathing.<ref name="Bonfire" />

====Scott's death (1980)====
As 1980 began, the band began work on a new album that would eventually become ''[[Back in Black]]'', but Bon Scott would not live to see it finished. On 19 February 1980, Scott passed out in the car on the way back to friend Alistair Kinnear's house after a night of heavy drinking at the Music Machine club in London. Upon arrival at his home, Kinnear was unable to move Scott from the car into his home for the night, so he left him in the car overnight to sleep off the effects of the alcohol. Unable to wake Scott late the next morning, Kinnear rushed him to [[King's College Hospital]] in Camberwell, where Scott was pronounced dead on arrival. [[Pulmonary aspiration]] of vomit was the cause of Scott's death,<ref name="BScottDeath2">"Scott [had] choked on his own vomit [in his sleep]."

Inconsistencies in the official accounts of Scott's death have been cited in conspiracy theories, which suggest that Scott died of a heroin overdose, or was killed by exhaust fumes redirected into the car, or that Kinnear did not exist.<ref name="BScottDeath" /> Additionally, Scott was [[asthma]]tic,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/A/Acdc/1997/11/22/742716.html | title = AC/DC lights a Bonfire in tribute | accessdate = 2 August 2008 | last = Stevenson | first = Jane | date = 22 November 1997 | work=[[Jam!|Canoe JAM! music]] }}</ref> and the temperature was below freezing on the morning of his death.

===The Brian Johnson era (1980–2016)===

====The rebirth (1980–83)====
[[File:Brian Johnson.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Brian Johnson Live with AC/DC in 2008]]
Following Scott's death the band briefly considered quitting, but encouraged by the insistence from Scott's parents that he would have wanted them to go on, they eventually decided to continue and went about finding a new frontman.<ref name="hell_aint" /> Various candidates were considered for his replacement, including: Buzz Shearman, ex-[[Moxy (band)|Moxy]] member, who was not able to join because of voice problems,<ref>{{cite web | title=Moxy Bio | work=CANOE JAM! MUSIC&nbsp;– Pop Encyclopedia |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Pop_Encyclopedia/M/Moxy.html}}</ref> ex-[[Back Street Crawler (band)|Back Street Crawler]] vocalist [[Terry Slesser]] and then [[Slade]] vocalist, [[Noddy Holder]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundchecks.co.uk/articles/noholder.html |title=Noddy Holder interview |publisher=Soundchecks.co.uk |accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref> The remaining AC/DC members finally decided on ex-[[Geordie (band)|Geordie]] singer [[Brian Johnson]].

Angus Young later recalled, "I remember the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of [[Little Richard]].' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him."<ref>{{cite web|author=bravewords.com |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/132727 |title=AC/DC Guitarist Angus Young Remembers Bon Scott&nbsp;– "When I Think Back in Hindsight, He Was A Guy That I Always Knew Was Full of Life" |publisher=Bravewords.com |accessdate=9 April 2011}}</ref>
[[File:Cliffwilliams.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Cliff Williams]] in 1981 during the [[For Those About to Rock Tour]]]]

For the audition, Johnson sang "[[Whole Lotta Rosie]]" from ''[[Let There Be Rock]]'' and [[Ike & Tina Turner]]'s "[[Nutbush City Limits]]".<ref name="acdc.cc" /> He was hired a few days after the audition. With Johnson the band completed the songwriting that they had begun with Scott for the album ''[[Back in Black]]''. Recording took place at [[Compass Point Studios]] in The Bahamas a few months after Scott's death. ''Back in Black'', produced by [[Robert John "Mutt" Lange|Mutt Lange]] and recorded by [[Tony Platt]], became their biggest-selling album and a hard-rock landmark; hits include "[[Hells Bells (song)|Hells Bells]]", "[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]", "[[Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution]]" and [[Back in Black (song)|the title track]]. The album reached No.1 in the UK and No.4 in the US, where it spent 131 weeks on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart.<ref name="timeline" />

The follow-up album, 1981's ''[[For Those About to Rock We Salute You]]'', also sold well and was positively received by critics. The album featured two of the band's most popular singles: "Let's Get It Up"<ref name="everyhit">{{cite web | title=EveryHit | url = http://www.everyhit.com | accessdate = 2 August 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913103452/http://www.everyhit.com/| archivedate=13 September 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref> and the title track, "[[For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)|For Those About to Rock]]", which reached No.13 and No.15 in the UK, respectively. The band split with Lange for their self-produced 1983 album, ''[[Flick of the Switch]]'', in an effort to recover the rawness and simplicity of their early albums.<ref name="flickof">{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r86|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&nbsp;– Flick of the Switch |publisher=Allmusic | first = Steve | last = Huey | accessdate = 2 August 2008 }}</ref>

Later in the year, AC/DC released the self-produced album ''[[Flick of the Switch]]'', which was less successful than their previous albums, and was considered underdeveloped and unmemorable.<ref name="flickof" /> One critic stated that the band "had made the same album nine times".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/acdc/albums/album/174854/review/5945613/flick_of_the_switch | title = AC/DC: Flick of the Switch | accessdate = 2 August 2008 | last = Fricke | first = David | date = 27 October 1987 | work=Rolling Stone | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618141735/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/acdc/albums/album/174854/review/5945613/flick_of_the_switch| archivedate=18 June 2008 | deadurl=yes}}</ref> AC/DC were voted the eighth-biggest disappointment of the year in the 1984 ''[[Kerrang!]]'' readers' poll. However, ''Flick of the Switch'' eventually reached No.4 on the UK charts,<ref name="acdc.cc" /> and AC/DC had minor success with the singles "[[Nervous Shakedown]]" and "[[Flick of the Switch (song)|Flick of the Switch]]". ''[[Fly on the Wall (AC/DC album)|Fly on the Wall]]'', produced by the Young brothers in 1985, was also regarded as uninspired and directionless.<ref>{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r88|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&nbsp;– Fly on the Wall |publisher=Allmusic | first = Steve | last = Huey | accessdate = 2 August 2008 }}</ref> A music concept video of [[Fly on the Wall (video)|the same name]] featured the band at a bar, playing five of the album's ten songs.

In 1986, the group returned to the charts with the made-for-radio "[[Who Made Who (song)|Who Made Who]]". The album ''[[Who Made Who]]'' was the soundtrack to [[Stephen King]]'s film ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'';<ref name="popmatters" /> it brought together older hits, such as "[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]" and "Ride On", with newer songs such as title track "Who Made Who", and two new instrumentals, "D.T." and "Chase the Ace".

In February 1988, AC/DC were inducted into the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]]'s [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web | title = ARIA Icons: Hall of Fame | work=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]] | url = http://www.aria.com.au/pages/hall-of-fame.htm |accessdate = 2 August 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718214652/http://aria.com.au/pages/hall-of-fame.htm| archivedate=18 July 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

====Back to commercial success (1987–90)====
AC/DC's 1988 album, ''[[Blow Up Your Video]]'', was recorded at [[Studio Miraval]] in [[Le Val]] ([[Occitania]]), France, and reunited the band with their original producers, [[Harry Vanda]] and [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]]. The group recorded nineteen songs, choosing ten for the final release; though the album was later criticised for containing excessive "[[filler (media)|filler]]",<ref name="blowup">{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r90|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&nbsp;– Blow Up your Video |publisher=Allmusic | first = Greg | last = Prato | accessdate = 2 August 2008 }}</ref> it was a commercial success. ''Blow Up Your Video'' sold more copies than the previous two studio releases combined, reaching No.2 on the UK charts—AC/DC's highest position since "Back in Black" in 1980. The album featured the UK top-twenty single "[[Heatseeker (song)|Heatseeker]]"<ref name=everyhit /> and popular songs such as "[[That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll]]". The ''Blow Up Your Video'' World Tour began in February 1988, in [[Perth]], Australia. That April, following live appearances across Europe, [[Malcolm Young]] announced that he was taking time off from touring, principally to begin recovery from his alcoholism. Another member of the Young family, [[Stevie Young]], temporarily took Malcolm's place.

Following the tour, Wright left the group to work on the upcoming [[Dio (band)|Dio]] album ''[[Lock Up the Wolves]]'', and was replaced by session veteran [[Chris Slade]]. Johnson was unavailable for several months while finalising his divorce,<ref name="acdc.cc" /> so the Young brothers wrote all the songs for the next album, a practice they continued for all subsequent releases through ''[[Rock or Bust]]'' in 2014.

====Popularity regained (1990–1994)====
[[File:Ac-dcphil-rudd.jpg|thumb|[[Phil Rudd]] performs at the [[KeyArena]] in Seattle on 12 August 1996 during the [[Ballbreaker World Tour]]]]
The next album, ''[[The Razors Edge (AC/DC album)|The Razors Edge]]'', was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was mixed and engineered by [[Mike Fraser (record producer)|Mike Fraser]] and produced by [[Bruce Fairbairn]], who had previously worked with [[Aerosmith]] and [[Bon Jovi]]. Released in 1990, it was a major comeback for the band, and included the hits "[[Thunderstruck (song)|Thunderstruck]]" and "[[Are You Ready (AC/DC song)|Are You Ready]]", which reached No.5 and No.16 respectively on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboards]] [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] Chart, and [[Moneytalks]]'', which peaked at No.23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="everyhit" /> The album went [[multi-platinum]] and reached the US top ten. Several shows on the Razors Edge tour were recorded for the 1992 live album, titled <nowiki/>''[[Live (AC/DC album)|Live]]''. ''Live'' was produced by Fairbairn, and is considered one of the best live albums of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53486|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&nbsp;– AC/DC Live |publisher=Allmusic | first = Barry | last = Weber | accessdate = 2 August 2008 }}</ref> AC/DC headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] show during this tour, which was released on DVD as ''[[Live at Donington (AC/DC album)|Live at Donington]]''. During ''The Razors Edge'' tour three fans were killed at a concert at the [[Salt Palace (arena)|Salt Palace]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] in January 1991. When the concert began fans rushed the stage crushing the three and injuring others. It took 20 minutes before venue security and the group understood the severity of the situation and stopped the concert. AC/DC settled with the victims' families out of court. As a result of this incident, the Salt Palace eliminated [[festival seating]] from future events.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/146127/SL-COUNTY-FINDS-NO-NEGLIGENCE-IN-CONCERT-DEATHS.html |title=S.L.

====Popularity confirmed (1994–2008)====
In 1994, Angus and Malcolm invited Rudd to several [[jam session]]s. He was eventually rehired to replace Slade, whose amicable departure arose in part because of the band's strong desire to again work with Rudd. Recorded at the [[Ocean Way Recording|Ocean Way Studios]] in Los Angeles by the reunited 1980–83 line-up and produced by [[Rick Rubin]], ''[[Ballbreaker]]'' was released in 1995. The first single from the album was "[[Hard as a Rock]]". Two more singles were released from the album: "[[Hail Caesar (song)|Hail Caesar]]" and "[[Cover You in Oil]]".<br />
In 1997, a box set named ''[[Bonfire (album)|Bonfire]]'' was released. It contained four albums; a [[remaster]]ed version of ''Back in Black''; ''[[Volts (album)|Volts]]'' (a disc with alternate takes, outtakes, and stray live cuts) and two live albums, ''[[Live from the Atlantic Studios]]'' and ''[[Let There Be Rock: The Movie&nbsp;– Live in Paris|Let There Be Rock: The Movie]]''. ''Live from the Atlantic Studios'' was recorded on 7 December 1977 at the Atlantic Studios in New York. ''Let There Be Rock: The Movie'' was a double album recorded in 1979 at the [[Pavillon de Paris]] and was the soundtrack of a motion picture, ''[[AC/DC: Let There Be Rock]]''. The US version of the box set included a colour booklet, a two-sided poster, a sticker, a temporary tattoo, a keychain bottle opener, and a guitar pick.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.acdc-discography.com/CDBoxSets.html | title = Boxsets | accessdate = 2 August 2008 | work=AC/DC discography | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728070955/http://www.acdc-discography.com/CDBoxSets.html| archivedate=28 July 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref>
[[File:AngusYoung1.JPG|left|thumb|Angus Young performs in [[Cologne]], Germany in 2001 during the [[Stiff Upper Lip World Tour|Stiff Upper Lip Tour]]]] In 2000, the band released ''[[Stiff Upper Lip (album)|Stiff Upper Lip]]'', produced by brother [[George Young (rock musician)|George Young]] at the Warehouse Studio, again in Vancouver. The album was better received by critics than ''Ballbreaker'' but was considered lacking in new ideas.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/acdc/albums/album/198241/review/5941859/stiff_upper_lip | title = AC/DC: Stiff Upper Lip | accessdate = 2 August 2008 | last = Wild | first = David | date = 30 March 2000 | work=Rolling Stone | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727012816/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/acdc/albums/album/198241/review/5941859/stiff_upper_lip| archivedate=27 July 2008 | deadurl=yes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r465726|pure_url=yes}} | title = AC/DC&nbsp;– Stiff Upper Lip |publisher=Allmusic | first = Stephen Thomas | last = Erlewine | accessdate = 2 August 2008 }}</ref> The Australian release included a bonus disc with three promotional videos and several live performances recorded in Madrid, Spain in 1996. ''Stiff Upper Lip'' reached No.1 in five countries, including Argentina and Germany; No.2 in three countries, Spain, France and Switzerland; No.3 in Australia; No.5 in Canada and Portugal; and No.7 in Norway, the US and Hungary. The first single, "[[Stiff Upper Lip (song)|Stiff Upper Lip]]", remained at No.1 on the US Mainstream Rock charts for four weeks.<ref name="timeline" /> The other singles released also did very well; "[[Satellite Blues]]" and "[[Safe in New York City]]" reached No.7 and No.31 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks, respectively.

''Ballbreaker'' was eventually re-released in October 2005; ''Stiff Upper Lip'' was later re-released in April 2007. Also in 2003, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

On 30 July 2003, the band performed with [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]] at [[Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto]]. The concert, held before an audience of half a million, was intended to help the city overcome the negative publicity stemming from the effects of a 2003 [[severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]] epidemic.

====Brian Johnson's hearing loss and departure====
On 7 March 2016, the band announced that the final ten dates of the [[Rock or Bust World Tour]] would be rescheduled as Johnson's doctors had ordered him to stop touring immediately, as his hearing loss had accelerated and he risked complete deafness if he persisted on the road. The ten cancelled dates would be performed "likely with a guest vocalist" later in the year, leaving Johnson's future in touring with the group uncertain.<ref>{{cite web|last=Roffman |first=Michael |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/03/acdc-frontman-brian-johnson-ordered-to-stop-touring-immediately-or-risk-total-hearing-loss/ |title=AC/DC frontman Brian Johnson ordered "to stop touring immediately or risk total hearing loss" |publisher=Consequence of Sound |date=2016-03-07 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> Johnson himself later stated on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' that his hearing loss didn't come from having performed for 36 years with AC/DC, but rather his love of auto racing and having forgotten to put on ear plugs in during one race left him with a busted ear drum in his left ear.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sutton |first=Candace |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3484732/It-s-not-high-voltage-rock-roll-AC-DC-man-Brian-Johnson-says-REAL-reason-gone-deaf-love-fast-cars.html |title=AC/DC's Brian Johnson says he has gone deaf due to his love of fast cars |website=Dailymail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref>

However, on 15 March 2016, American comedian [[Jim Breuer]] (a close personal friend of Johnson) revealed on his podcast that Johnson had received a [[second opinion]] on his hearing and it was not as bad as initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson told him that he was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/aushowbiz/article-3494168/AC-DC-lead-singer-Brian-Johnson-feels-betrayed-band-mates-including-Angus-Young-revealed-losing-hearing.html|title=AC/DC's Brian Johnson feels betrayed by band mates over hearing issues|date=15 March 2016|work=Mail Online}}</ref> Breuer later clarified his comments on [[Facebook]] that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/03/brian-johnson-downplays-hearing-issues-says-he-was-kicked-to-the-curb-acdc/|title=Brian Johnson downplays hearing issues, says he was "kicked to the curb" by AC/DC|work=Consequence of Sound}}</ref>

On 19 April 2016, Johnson made an official statement regarding his health problems and inability to tour.

On 16 April 2016, AC/DC released a statement announcing the addition of [[Guns N' Roses]] frontman [[Axl Rose]] as the band's lead vocalist for the remainder of their 2016 tour dates, and apparently confirming Johnson's departure. The statement reads: "AC/DC band members would like to thank Brian Johnson for his contributions and dedication to the band throughout the years. We wish him all the best with his hearing issues and future ventures. As much as we want this tour to end as it started, we understand, respect and support Brian's decision to stop touring and save his hearing. We are dedicated to fulfilling the remainder of our touring commitments to everyone that has supported us over the years, and are fortunate that Axl Rose has kindly offered his support to help us fulfill this commitment. AC/DC will resume their Rock or Bust World Tour with Axl Rose joining on vocals."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.acdc.com/news?n_id=278|title=Rock Or Bust World Tour Continues With Axl Rose|date=16 April 2016|accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ac-dc-confirm-axl-rose-is-new-lead-singer-joining-band-on-tour-20160416|title=AC/DC Confirm Axl Rose Is New Lead Singer, Joining Band on Tour|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=16 April 2016|work=RollingStone.com|accessdate=17 April 2016}}</ref>

[[File:ACDC Lane.jpg|thumb|The street sign for [[ACDC Lane]], Melbourne]]
AC/DC were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on 10 March 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/ac-dc |title=AC/DC |publisher=Rockhall.com |accessdate=1 February 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117052005/http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/ac-dc| archivedate=17 January 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref> During the ceremony the band performed "[[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway to Hell]]" and "[[You Shook Me All Night Long]]", with guest vocals provided by host [[Steven Tyler]] of [[Aerosmith]]. He described the band's [[power chord]]s as "the thunder from down under that gives you the second most powerful surge that can flow through your body."<ref>{{cite news | title = Rock and Roll Hall of Fame open doors |publisher=CNN | date = 3 November 2003 | accessdate = 2 August 2008 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/11/rock.hall.fame.ap/index.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031003075850/http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/03/11/rock.hall.fame.ap/index.html | archivedate = 3 October 2003 }}</ref> During the acceptance speech, [[Brian Johnson]] quoted their 1977 song "[[Let There Be Rock (song)|Let There Be Rock]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12027761 |title=AC/DC, The Clash, The Police And Others Inducted into Hall of Fame |accessdate=2 August 2008 |last=Johnson |first=Billy |date=3 November 2003 |work=[[LAUNCHcast|Yahoo!

On 22 March 2000, the municipality of [[Leganés]] (near [[Madrid]]) named a street in honour of the band as "Calle de AC/DC" ("AC/DC Street"). Malcolm and Angus attended the inauguration with many fans. Later that day, the plaque with the name of the group was stolen, perhaps by an enthusiast or collector. The plaque was replaced two hours later, and stolen once again a mere three days after the fact. The plaque had since been stolen numerous times, forcing the municipality of Leganés to begin selling replicas of the official street plaque.

In May 2003, the Young brothers accepted a [[Ted Albert]] Award for Outstanding Service to Australian Music at the 2003 Music Winners Awards, during which Malcolm paid special tribute to Bon Scott, who was also a recipient of the award.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.apra.com.au/awards/music/media_releases/03-music_award_winners_announced.asp | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080723033156/http://apra.com.au/awards/music/media_releases/03-music_award_winners_announced.asp | archivedate = 23 July 2008 | title = 2003 Music Winners Awards Announced | work=[[Australasian Performing Right Association]] | accessdate = 2 August 2008}}</ref>

On 1 October 2004, a central Melbourne thoroughfare, Corporation Lane, was renamed [[ACDC Lane]] in honour of the band. However, the [[City of Melbourne]] forbade the use of the [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] character in street names, so the four letters were combined.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=228&pg=715&st=191 | title = Next stage in AC/DC Lane proposal wins in-principle support | accessdate = 2 August 2008 | date = 8 July 2004 | work=City of Melbourne }}</ref> The lane is near [[Swanston Street, Melbourne|Swanston Street]] where, on the back of a truck, the band recorded their video for the 1975 hit "[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)|It's a Long Way to the Top]]".<ref name="acdclane" />

They sold over 1.3&nbsp;million CDs in the US during 2007 despite not having released a new album since 2000 at that point. Additionally, the group's commercial success continues to flourish despite their choice to refrain from selling albums in digital online formats for many years.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/arts/music/12levi.html|title=Ageless and Defiant, AC/DC Stays on Top Without Going Digital|work=The New York Times |author=Levine, Robert|date=10 October 2008|accessdate=19 November 2008| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219213927/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/12/arts/music/12levi.html| archivedate=19 December 2008 | deadurl=no}}</ref> However, in November 2012, the entire catalogue (excluding the ''[[T.N.T. (album)|TNT]]'' album and the Australian versions of the ''[[High Voltage (1975 album)|High Voltage]]'', ''[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap#Australian|Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]'' and ''[[Let There Be Rock]]'' albums) became available on the [[iTunes Store]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sisario|first=Ben|title=AC/DC Joins iTunes, as Spotify Emerges as Music's New Disrupter|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/acdc-joins-itunes-as-spotify-emerges-as-musics-new-disrupter/|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=19 November 2012}}</ref>

In 2009 the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] upgraded the group's US sales figures from 69&nbsp;million to 71&nbsp;million, making AC/DC the fifth-best-selling band in US history and the tenth-best-selling artist, selling more albums than [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Mariah Carey]].<ref name="riaa1" /> The RIAA also certified ''Back in Black'' as double Diamond (20&nbsp;million) in US sales, and by 2007 the album had sold 22&nbsp;million copies, which made it the fifth-best-selling album of all-time in the US.<ref name="riaa2" />
It is currently the second-best-selling album worldwide.
