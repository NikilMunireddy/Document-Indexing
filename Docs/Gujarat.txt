The state is bordered by [[Rajasthan]] to the north, [[Maharashtra]] to the south, [[Madhya Pradesh]] to the east, and the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Pakistan]]i province of [[Sindh]] to the west. Its capital city is [[Gandhinagar]], while its largest city is [[Ahmedabad]]. Gujarat is home to the [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]-speaking people of India.

The state encompasses some sites of the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilization]], such as [[Lothal]] and [[Dholavira]]. Lothal is believed to be one of the world's first seaports. Gujarat's coastal cities, chiefly [[Bharuch]] and [[Khambhat]], served as ports and trading centres in the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] empires, and during the succession of royal [[Saka]] dynasties from the [[Western Satraps]] era, whose geographic territories included Saurashtra and Malwa: modern Gujarat, South Sindh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh states.

Gujarat was known to the [[Ancient Greeks]], and was familiar in other Western centers of civilization through the end of the European [[Middle Ages]]. The oldest written record of Gujarat's 2,000-year maritime history is documented in a Greek book titled ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea|The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century''.<ref>{{citation |last=Vashi|first=Ashish|title=Saga of Barygaza|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-21/ahmedabad/28239734_1_bharuch-port-book|publisher=The Times of India|date=Oct 21, 2010|quote="The book describes an episode of a foreigner bringing costly gifts for kings, saying, "And for the King there are very costly vessels of silver, singing boys, beautiful maidens for the harem, fine wines, thin clothing of the finest weaves, and the choicest ointments."}}</ref><ref>{{citation |title=The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: Travel and Trade in the Indian Ocean by a Merchant of the First Century|url=http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/periplus/periplus.html|accessdate=1 October 2013|author=William H.

===Ancient history===
[[File:Lothal dock.jpg|thumb|left|The docks of ancient Lothal as they are today]]
[[File:Dholavira1.JPG|left|thumb|Ancient sophisticated water reservoir at Dholavira]]

Historically, the state of Gujarat has been one of the main centres of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. It contains some ancient metropolitan cities from the [[Indus Valley]] such as [[Lothal]], [[Dholavira]], and [[Gola Dhoro]]. The ancient city of Lothal was where India's first port was established. The ancient city of Dholavira is one of the largest and most prominent archaeological sites in India, belonging to the Indus Valley Civilization. The most recent discovery was Gola Dhoro. Altogether, about 50 Indus Valley settlement ruins have been discovered in Gujarat.<ref name="mapsofindia.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/gujarat/history/ |title=History of Gujarat |publisher=Mapsofindia.com |accessdate=16 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100526165223/http://www.mapsofindia.com:80/gujarat/history/ |archivedate=26 May 2010 }}</ref>

The ancient history of Gujarat was enriched by the commercial activities of its inhabitants. There is clear historical evidence of trade and commerce ties with [[Egypt]], [[Bahrain]] and [[Sumer]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the time period of 1000 to 750 BC.<ref name="mapsofindia.com"/><ref>S. R. Rao (1985). Lothal. Archaeological Survey of India. p. 11.</ref> There was a succession of [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] states such as the [[Mauryan Dynasty]], [[Western Satraps]], [[Satavahana dynasty]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Chalukya dynasty]], [[Rashtrakuta Empire]], [[Pala Empire]] and [[Gurjara-Pratihara|Gurjara-Pratihara Empire]], as well as local dynasties such as the [[Maitraka]]s and then the [[Solanki]]s.

The early history of Gujarat reflects the imperial grandeur of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] who conquered a number of earlier states in what is now Gujarat. Pushyagupta, a [[Vaishya]], was appointed governor of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Giringer (modern day [[Junagadh]]) (322 BC to 294 BC) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake. Emperor [[Ashoka]], the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his edicts on the rock at [[Junagadh]], but asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the Samprati Mauryas of [[Ujjain]], there was a [[Indo-Greek]] incursion into Gujarat led by [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]]. In the first half of the 1st century AD there is the story of a merchant of King Gondaphares landing in Gujarat with [[Apostle Thomas]]. The incident of the cup-bearer killed by a lion might indicate that the port city described is in Gujarat.<ref>The Acts of Judas Thomas, M.R.James,Tr.by M. R. James, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1924.</ref><ref>Medlycott, A. E. [http://www.indianchristianity.com/html/chap4/chapter4a.htm India and the Apostle Thomas]</ref>

For nearly 300 years from the start of the 1st century AD, [[Saka]] rulers played a prominent part in Gujarat's history. The weather-beaten rock at Junagadh gives a glimpse of the ruler [[Rudradaman I]] (100 AD) of the Saka satraps known as [[Western Satraps]], or Kshatraps. Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I founded the Kardamaka dynasty which ruled from Anupa on the banks of the Narmada up to the Aparanta region which bordered Punjab. In Gujarat several battles were fought between the south Indian [[Satavahana dynasty]] and the Western Satraps.
The greatest ruler of the Satavahana Dynasty was [[Gautamiputra Satakarni]] who defeated the Western Satraps and conquered some parts of Gujarat in the 2nd century CE.<ref>Trade And Trade Routes In Ancient India von Moti Chandra page: 99</ref>

The Kshatrapa dynasty was replaced by the [[Gupta Empire]] with the conquest of Gujarat by [[Chandragupta Vikramaditya]]. Vikramaditya's successor Skandagupta left an inscription (450 AD) on a rock at Junagadh which gives details of the governor's repairs to the embankment surrounding Sudarshan lake after it was damaged by floods. The Anarta and Saurashtra regions were both part of the Gupta empire. Towards the middle of the 5th century, the Gupta empire went into decline. Senapati Bhatarka, the Maitraka general of the Guptas, took advantage of the situation and in 470 AD he set up what came to be known as the [[Maitraka]] state. He shifted his capital from Giringer to Valabhipur, near Bhavnagar, on Saurashtra's east coast. The Maitrakas of Vallabhi became very powerful with their rule prevailing over large parts of Gujarat and adjoining [[Malwa]]. A university was set up by the Maitrakas, which came to be known far and wide for its scholastic pursuits and was compared with the noted [[Nalanda university]]. It was during the rule of Dhruvasena Maitrak that Chinese philosopher-traveler [[Xuanzang]] visited in 640 AD along the [[Silk Road]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mote|first1=Sally Hovey Wriggins ; with a foreword by Frederick W.|title=Xuanzang : a Buddhist pilgrim on the Silk Road|date=1996|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colo.|isbn=0813328012|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RwQLAAAAYAAJ&q=Chinese+philosopher-traveler+Xuanzang,+gujarat&dq=Chinese+philosopher-traveler+Xuanzang,+gujarat&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZXziVJnHOsatU-35gsgF&redir_esc=y|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>

In the early 8th century, the Arabs of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] established an Empire which stretched from Spain in the west to Afghanistan and modern-day Pakistan in the east. Al-Junaid, the successor of Qasim, finally subdued the Hindu resistance within Sindh and had established a secure base. The Arab rulers tried to expand their empire southeast, which culminated in the [[Battle of Rajasthan]] fought in 730 CE. However, the Arab invaders were defeated and repelled from the areas east of the [[Indus]] river by a Hindu alliance between the north Indian [[Gurjar]] Emperor [[Nagabhata I]] of the [[Pratihara]] Dynasty, the south Indian Emperor [[Vikramaditya II]] of the [[Chalukya]] dynasty and many other local small Hindu kingdoms. After this victory, the Arab invaders were driven out of Gujarat. General Pulakesi, a Chalukya prince of [[Lata (region)|Lata]], received the title Avanijanashraya (refuge of the people of the earth) and honorific of "repeller of the unrepellable" by the south Indian Emperor [[Vikramaditya II]] of the [[Chalukya dynasty]] for the protection of Gujarat during the battle at [[Navsari]] where [[Syrian]] troops suffered a crushing defeat.<ref>{{cite book|last=Blankinship|first=Khalid Yahya|title=The end of the jihād state : the reign of Hishām ibn ʻAbd al-Malik and the collapse of the Umayyads|year=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=0791418286|page=189|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNGq6sU-xbgC&pg=PA187&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 January 2014|quote=The Syrian troops became increasingly reluctant to serve on the ill-omened Indian front, which seemed, after so many failures, to be well on its way to becoming the worst front.}}</ref> In the late 8th century the Kannauj Triangle period started.

In the early 8th century some parts of Gujarat was ruled by the south Indian [[Chalukya dynasty]]. In the early 8th century the Arabs of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] established an Empire which stretched from Spain in the west to Afghanistan and  Pakistan in the east.

Gujarat was a major center of Indian Ocean trade, and their capital at [[Anhilwara]] ([[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]]) was one of the largest cities in India, with population estimated at 100,000 in the year 1000. In 1026, the famous [[Somnath]] temple in Gujarat was destroyed by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]]. After 1243, the Solankis lost control of Gujarat to their feudatories, of whom the [[Vaghela]] chiefs of [[Dholka]] came to dominate Gujarat. In 1292 the Vaghelas became tributaries of the [[Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri|Yadava]] dynasty of [[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Devagiri]] in the [[Deccan]]. Karandev of the [[Vaghela dynasty]] was the last Hindu ruler of Gujarat. He was defeated and overthrown by the superior forces of [[Allauddin Khilji]] from Delhi in 1297. With his defeat Gujarat not only became part of the Muslim empire but the Rajput hold over Gujarat lost for ever.

[[Persia]] was the destination for many of these commodities, and they were partly paid for in [[horses]] and [[pearls]] taken from [[Hormuz Island|Hormuz]] (Barbosa, I, p.&nbsp;82). It was the latter item, in particular, which led Sultan [[Sikandar Lodi]] of [[Delhi]], according to Ali-Muhammad Khan, author of the Mirat-i-Ahmadi, to complain that the “''support of the throne of Delhi is wheat and barley but the foundation of the realm of Gujarat is coral and pearls''” (apud Bayley, p.&nbsp;20). Hence, the sultans of Gujarat possessed ample means to sustain lavish patronage of religion and the arts, and to build madrasas, and ḵānaqāhs, and to provide douceurs for the literati, mainly poets and historians, whose presence and praise enhanced the fame of the dynasty.<ref name="iranicaonline.org">[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gujarat GUJARAT – Encyclopædia Iranica].

Even at the time of Tom Pires' travel to the [[East Indies]] in the early 16th century, Gujarati merchants had earned an international reputation for their commercial acumen and this encouraged the visit of merchants from [[Cairo]], [[Armenia]], [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], [[Shiraz]], [[Turkestan]] and [[Gilan Province|Guilans]] from Aden and Hormuz.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Freeman-Grenville|first1=G.S.P.|last2=Munro-Hay|first2=Stuart Christopher|title=Historical atlas of Islam|date=2002|publisher=Continuum|location=New York [u.a.]|isbn=0-8264-1417-6|page=250|edition=Rev. and expanded|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3fKoAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=Guilans+in+aden&source=bl&ots=fXtxQsV9s0&sig=ZzLwAJFePtH0iPgMMTTz-pg0jrc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0FPjVIPLE4a9Ue2xgpgF&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Guilans%20in%20aden&f=false|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> Pires noted in his ''Suma Orientale'':<ref>{{cite book|title=The South Asian Diaspora: Transnational Networks and Changing Identities|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1134105959|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwJD2WBNtNMC&pg=PA28&dq=gujarati,+philippines&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EgBPUtbaBMqh0QXj1oEI&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=gujarati%2C%20philippines&f=false|editor1=Rajesh Rai |editor2=Peter Reeves |accessdate=4 October 2013}}</ref>

===Gujarat and the Mughal Empire===
[[File:Aurangzeb-portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Mughal Emperor, [[Aurangzeb]]]]

[[Aurangzeb]], who was better known by his imperial title [[Alamgir I|Alamgir]] ("Conqueror of the World"), was born at [[Dahod]], Gujarat, and was the sixth Mughal Emperor ruling with an iron fist over most of the Indian subcontinent. He was the third son and sixth child of [[Shah Jahan]] and [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. At the time of his birth, his father, Shah Jahan, was then the Subedar (governor) of Gujarat whilst his (Shah Jahan's) father, [[Jehangir]], was the Mughal Emperor. Before he became emperor, Aurangzeb was made Subedar of Gujarat as part of his training and was stationed at [[Ahmedabad]]. Aurangzeb was a notable expansionist and was amongst the wealthiest of the Mughal rulers with an annual yearly tribute of £38,624,680 (in 1690). During his lifetime, victories in the south expanded the Mughal Empire to more than 3.2 million square kilometres and he ruled over a population estimated as being in the range of 100–150 million subjects.

Aurangzeb had great love for his place of birth. In 1704, he wrote a letter to his eldest son, [[Muhammad Azam Shah]], asking him to be kind and considerate to the people of Dahod as it was his birthplace. Muhammad Azam was then the Subedar (governor) of Gujarat.

In his letter, Aurangzeb wrote:<ref>{{cite web|title=Aurangzeb loved Dahod till the end|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1682952/report-aurangzeb-loved-dahod-till-the-end|publisher=dnaindia.com|accessdate=4 October 2013|author=Ashish Vashi|date=1 May 2012|quote=Eminent historian Manekshah Commissariat has quoted from this letter in his book 'A History of Gujarat: Mughal period, from 1573 to 1758'.}}</ref>

===Maratha Empire===
[[File:Peshwa Baji Rao I riding horse.jpg|thumb|upright|Peshwa [[Baji Rao I]] riding a horse]]
When the cracks had started to develop in the edifice of the [[Mughal empire]] in the mid-17th century, the Marathas were consolidating their power in the west, [[Chatrapati Shivaji]], the great Maratha ruler, attacked Surat twice first in 1664 and again in 1672. These attacks marked the entry of the Marathas into Gujarat. However, before the Maratha inroads into Gujarat, the Europeans had made their presence felt, with the Portuguese leading them, followed by the Dutch and the English.

The [[Peshwa]]s had established their sovereignty over Gujarat including [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], and collected taxes and tributes through their representatives. Damaji Gaekwad and Kadam Bande divided the Peshwa's territory between them, with Damaji establishing the sway of Gaekwad over Gujarat and made [[Baroda]] (present day [[Vadodara]]) his capital. The ensuing internecine war among the Marathas were fully exploited by the British, who interfered in the affairs of both Gaekwads and the Peshwas.

===European Imperialism 1614–1947 AD===

[[File:Baroda-gujarat.png|thumb|right|Princely states of Gujarat in 1924]]
In the 1600s, the Dutch, French, English and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] all established bases along the western coast of the region. Portugal was the first European power to arrive in Gujarat, and aftermath the [[Battle of Diu]] and [[Treaty of Bassein (1802)|Treaty of Bassein]], acquired several enclaves along the Gujarati coast, including [[Daman and Diu]] as well as [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]]. These enclaves were administered by [[Portuguese India]] under a single union territory for over 450 years, only to be later incorporated into the [[Republic of India]] on 19 December 1961 by military conquest.

The [[British East India Company]] established a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Surat]] in 1614 following the commercial treaty made with Mughal Emperor Nuruddin Salim [[Jahangir]], which formed their first base in India, but it was eclipsed by [[Mumbai|Bombay]] after the English received it from Portugal in 1668 as part of the marriage treaty of [[Charles II of England]] and [[Catherine of Braganza]], daughter of [[King John IV of Portugal]]. The state was an early point of contact with the west, and the first British commercial outpost in India was in Gujarat.<ref name="wingsbirds.com">[http://wingsbirds.com/tours/india-west-gujarat-rann-kutch/ WINGS Birding Tours to India: the West – Gujarat and the Rann of Kutch – Itinerary].

17th-century French explorer [[François Pyrard de Laval]] who is remembered for his 10-year sojourn in South Asia, bears witness accounts that the Gujaratis were always prepared to learn workmanship from the Portuguese, also in turn imparting skills to the Portuguese:<ref>{{cite book|last=Rai|first=Rajesh|title=The South Asian diaspora transnational networks and changing identities|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203892350|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zb_X3L96AfgC&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=gujarati,+Francois+Pyrard&source=bl&ots=f109b_0Hrg&sig=8c5T6DIiWCb_2FZ9NfRhEPe_u9Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-1JPUsqVHYiR0QX3iIC4BQ&ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=gujarati%2C%20Francois%20Pyrard&f=false|author2=Reeves, Peter |accessdate=5 October 2013}}</ref>

In fact the ''Portuguese'' take and learn more from them than they from the ''Portuguese''.}}

Later in the 17th century, Gujarat came under control of the [[Maratha Empire]] who dominated the politics of India. Most notably, from 1705–1716, [[Senapati]] [[Khanderao Dabhade]] led the Maratha Empire forces in Baroda. [[Pilaji Gaekwad]], first ruler of [[Gaekwad|Gaekwad dynasty]], established the control over Baroda and parts of Gujarat. The [[British East India Company]] wrested control of much of Gujarat from the Marathas during the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]] in 1802–1803. Many local rulers, notably the Maratha [[Gaekwad]]s of Baroda ([[Vadodara]]), made a separate peace with the British and acknowledged British sovereignty in return for retaining local self-rule.

Gujarat was placed under the political authority of the [[Bombay Presidency]], with the exception of [[Baroda state]], which had a direct relationship with the [[Governor-General of India]]. From 1818 to 1947, most of present-day Gujarat, including [[Kathiawar]], Kutch, and northern and eastern Gujarat were divided into hundreds of [[princely states]], but several districts in central and southern Gujarat, namely [[Ahmedabad district|Ahmedabad]], Broach ([[Bharuch district|Bharuch]]), Kaira ([[Kheda district|Kheda]]), [[Panchmahal district|Panchmahal]], and [[Surat district|Surat]], were ruled directly by British officials.

===Post independence===

[[File:Bombay 1956-1960.svg|thumb|Gujarat in Bombay state]]
After [[Independence of India|Indian independence]] and the [[partition of India]] in 1947, the new Indian government grouped the former princely states of Gujarat into three larger units; [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]], which included the former princely states on the [[Kathiawad]] peninsula, [[Kutch]], and [[Bombay state]], which included the former British districts of Bombay Presidency together with most of [[Baroda state]] and the other former princely states of eastern Gujarat. Bombay state was enlarged to include Kutch, Saurashtra, and parts of [[Hyderabad state]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]] in central India. The new state had a mostly Gujarati-speaking north and a Marathi-speaking south. Agitation by Gujarati nationalists, the [[Mahagujarat Movement]], and Marathi nationalists, the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|Samyukta Maharashtra]], for their own states led to the split of [[Bombay state]] on linguistic lines; on 1 May 1960, it became the new states of Gujarat and [[Maharashtra]].

It is native to the Indian state of Gujarat, and is its main language, as well as of the adjacent union territories of [[Daman and Diu]] and [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]].

About 59 million people speak Gujarati, making it the 26th [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most-spoken native language]] in the world. Along with [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]], and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], it is amongst the most western of Indo-Aryan languages.

The majority of the population in the state can speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. People from the [[Kutch]] region of Gujarat also speak in the [[Kutchi language|Kutchi]] mother tongue, and to a great extent appreciate [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] as well. [[Memoni]] is the mother tongue of Kathiawar and Sindhi Memons, most of them who are exclusively Muslims.

Almost 88% of the [[Gujarati Muslims]] speak Gujarati as their mother tongue, whilst the other 12% speak [[Urdu]].

Gujarat is governed by a [[Gujarat Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] of 182 members. Members of the Legislative Assembly are elected on the basis of adult suffrage from one of 182 constituencies, of which 13 are reserved for [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled castes]] and 27 for [[scheduled tribe]]s. The term of office for a member of the Legislative Assembly is five years. The Legislative Assembly elects a speaker who presides over the meetings of the legislature. A governor is appointed by the [[President of India]], and is to address the state legislature after every general election and the commencement of each year's first session of the Legislative Assembly. The leader of the majority party or coalition in the legislature (Chief Minister) or his or her designee acts as the Leader of the Legislative Assembly. The administration of the state is led by the Chief Minister. The current Chief Minister of the state is [[Anandiben Patel]], who recently took office after [[Narendra Modi]] was elected as Prime Minister of India.

After gaining independence in 1947, the [[Indian National Congress]] party (INC) ruled the [[Bombay State]] (which included present-day Gujarat and [[Maharashtra]]). Congress continued to govern Gujarat after the state's creation in 1960.

During and after India's [[State of Emergency in India|State of Emergency]] of 1975–1977, public support for the Congress Party eroded, but it continued to hold government until 1995. In the 1995 Assembly elections, the Congress lost to the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] and [[Keshubhai Patel]] came to power. His government lasted only two years. The fall of that government was provoked by a split in the BJP led by Shankersinh Vaghela, who won most of the subsequent polls. In 2001, following the loss of two assembly seats in by-elections, Keshubhai Patel resigned and yielded power to Narendra Modi. BJP retained a majority in the 2002 election, and Narendra Modi remained as Chief Minister of the state. On 1 June 2007, Narendra Modi became the longest serving Chief Minister of Gujarat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid%3D87512 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925193126/http://www.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=87512 |archivedate=25 September 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/070606/43/6gpdc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220191431/http://in.news.yahoo.com/070606/43/6gpdc.html |archivedate=20 December 2014 }}</ref> On 23 December 2007, the BJP won the state elections in Gujarat and Narendra Modi became the chief minister for the third time in a row.

After Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India in 2014, the office of Chief Minister was given to Smt. Anandiben Patel. Anandiben Patel is the first woman chief minister of Gujarat. She is believed to be the first lady after Minaldevi of Patan to have the highest authority over the state of Gujarat.

As per the results of livestock census 1997, there were 20.97 million head of livestock in Gujarat State. In the estimates of the survey of major livestock products, during the year 2002–03, the Gujarat produced 6.09 million tonnes of milk, 385 million eggs and 2.71 million kg of wool. Gujarat also contributes inputs to the textiles, oil, and soap industries, amongst others.

The adoption of cooperatives in Gujarat is widely attributed to much of the success in the agricultural sector, particularly sugar and dairy [[cooperative]]s. Cooperative farming has been a component of India’s strategy for agricultural development since 1951. Whilst the success of these was mixed throughout the country, their positive impact on the states of [[Maharashtra]] and Gujarat have been the most significant. In 1995 alone, the two states had more registered co-operatives than any other region in the country. Out of these, the agricultural cooperatives have received much attention. Many have focused on subsidies and credit to farmers and rather than collective gathering, they have focused on facilitating collective processing and marketing of produce. However, whilst they have led to increased productivity, their effect on equity in the region has been questioned, because membership in agricultural co-operatives has tended to favour landowners whilst limiting the entry of landless agricultural labourers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ebrahim|first=Alnoor|title=Agricultural cooperatives in Gujarat, India: Agents of equity or differentiation?|journal=Development in Practice|year=2000|volume=10|issue=2|pages=178–188|doi=10.1080/09614520050010214}}</ref> An example of co-operative success in Gujarat can be illustrated through dairy co-operatives, with the particular example of [[Amul]] (Anand Milk Union Limited).

70% of Gujarat's area is classified as semi-arid to arid climatically, thus the demand on water from various economic activities puts a strain on the supply.<ref>{{cite web|last=Suran|first=B|title=Is Agriculture in Gujarat on a Different Growth Trajectory?|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2080876|work=Social Science Research Network|publisher=National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)}}</ref> Of the total gross irrigated area, 16–17% is irrigated by government-owned canals and 83–84% by privately owned tube wells and other wells extracting groundwater, which is the predominant source of irrigation and water supply to the agricultural areas. As a result, Gujarat has faced problems with groundwater depletion, especially after demand for water went up in the 1960s. As access to electricity in rural areas increased, subermersible electric pumps became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s. However, the Gujarat Electricity Board switched to flat tariff rates linked to the horsepower of pumps, which increased tubewell irrigation again and decreased the use of electric pumps. By the 1990s, groundwater abstraction rates exceeded groundwater recharge rate in many districts, whilst only 37.5% of all districts has "safe" recharge rates. Groundwater maintenance and preventing unnecessary loss of the available water supplies is now an issue faced by the state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gulati|first=Ashok|title=Agriculture performance in Gujarat since 2000|year=2009|publisher=International Water Management Institute & International Food Policy Research Institute|page=10|url=http://www.gujaratcmfellowship.org/document/Agriculture/Agriculture%20Performance%20in%20Gujarat%20since%202000_IWMI%20&%20IFPRI%20Report-_May%202009.pdf}}</ref> The Sardar Sarovar Project, a debated dam project in the Narmada valley consisting of a network of canals, has significantly increased irrigation in the region. However, its impact on communities who were displaced is still a contested issue. Recently, in 2012, Gujarat began an experiment to reduce water loss due to evaporation in canals and to increase sustainability in the area by constructing solar panels over the canals. A one megawatt (MW) solar power project set up at Chandrasan, Gujarat uses solar panels fixed over a 750-metre stretch of an irrigation canal. Unlike many solar power projects, this one does not take up large amounts of land since the panels are constructed over the canals, and not on additional land. This results in lower upfront costs since land does not need to be acquired, cleared or modified to set up the panels. The Chandrasan project is projected to save 9 million litres of water per year.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sharma|first=D.C.|title=India Launches Solar Power Project|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|date=June 2012|volume=10|issue=5|page=230|url=http://www.esajournals.org/userimages/ContentEditor/1338573130999/i1540-9295-10-5-full.pdf|accessdate=21 February 2013|doi=10.1890/i1540-9295-10-5-228}}</ref>

The Government of Gujarat, to improve soil management and introduce farmers to new technology, started on a project which involved giving every farmer a Soil Health Card. This acts like a ration card, providing permanent identification for the status of cultivated land, as well as farmers' names, account numbers, survey numbers, soil fertility status and general fertiliser dose. Samples of land from each village are taken and analysed by the [[Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers|Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertiliser Corporation]], State Fertiliser Corporation and [[Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Limited|Indian Farmers Fertilisers Co-operative]]. 1,200,000 soil test data from the villages was collected as of 2008, from farmer’s field villages have gone into a database. Assistance and advice for this project was given by local agricultural universities and crop and soil-specific data was added to the database. This allows the soil test data to be interpreted and recommendations or adjustments made in terms of fertiliser requirements, which are also added to the database.<ref>{{cite book| last = Attri| first = S.D.| title = Challenges and Opportunities in Agrometeorology| url = https://books.google.com/?id=tmqIGTngveIC&pg=PA266| year = 2011| publisher = Springer| location = Heidelberg| isbn = 978-3-642-19360-6| page = 265 }}</ref>

===Diffusion of culture===
[[File:Dandiya Raas.jpg|thumb|left|Tourists playing Dandiya Raas]]
Due to close proximity to the Arabian Sea, Gujarat has developed a mercantile ethos which maintained a cultural tradition of [[seafaring]], long-distance trade, and [[overseas]] contacts with the outside world since ancient times, and the diffusion of culture through Gujarati [[diaspora]] was a logical outcome of such a tradition. During the pre-modern period, various European sources have observed that these merchants formed diaspora communities outside of Gujarat, and in many parts of the world, such as the [[Persian Gulf]], Middle East, [[Horn of Africa]], Hong Kong and [[Indonesia]]<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Rai| first1 = Rajesh| last2 = Reeves| first2 = Peter| title = The South Asian Diaspora: Transnational networks and changing identities| url = https://books.google.com/?id=zb_X3L96AfgC&pg=PA41| year = 2008| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 978-0-203-89235-0| page = 41| quote = The Gujarati merchant diaspora can still be found in the littoral cities of West Asia and Africa on the one hand and in Southeast Asia on the other.| editor = Rajesh Rai, Peter Reeves }}</ref> long before the internal rise of the [[Maratha]] Dynasty, and the [[British Raj]] colonial occupation.<ref>{{cite web|title='Even British were envious of Gujaratis'|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-12-11/vadodara/35748553_1_gujaratis-maritime-history-subcontinent|publisher=THE TIMES OF INDIA|date=11 December 2012|quote="Most people perceive that British dominated everything in the 19th century when the Indian sub-continent was under their control.

As financers, they (Gujarati merchants) had agents to collect tax, they had money to provide loans, they dominated the merchandise business and they were also into slavery business at Nairobi, Mombasa, Zanzibar on the East African coast and to some extent their influence was also on the South African region," he said.

As per the districts, [[The Dangs]] has the largest area under forest cover.
Gujarat has four national parks and 21 sanctuaries.
Gujarat is the only home of [[Asiatic lion]]s and outside Africa, Gujarat is the only present natural habitat of lions. [[Gir Forest National Park]] in the southwest part of the state covers part of the lions' habitat. Apart from lions, [[leopard]]s are also found in state. They are spread across the large plains of Saurashtra and the mountains of South Gujarat.Other National parks include [[Vansda National Park]], [[Blackbuck National Park, Velavadar]] and [[Marine National Park, Gulf of Kutch|Narara Marine National Park, Gulf of Kutchh, Jamnagar]]. Wildlife sanctuaries include: [[Wild Ass Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary]], [[Porbandar Bird Sanctuary]], [[Kutch Desert Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Kutch Bustard Sanctuary]], [[Narayan Sarovar Sanctuary]], [[Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary]], Anjal, Balaram-Ambaji, Barda, [[Jambughoda|Jambughoda Wildlife Sanctuary]], [[Khavda]], Paniya, Purna, Rampura, Ratanmahal, and Surpaneshwar.

Gujarat has some of major mountain ranges of India, including [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]], [[Western Ghats|Sahyadri (Western Ghats)]], [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] and [[Saputara]]. Apart from this Gir hills, Barda, Jessore, [[Chotila]], etc. are situated in different parts of Gujarat. [[Girnar]] is the tallest peak and [[Saputara]] is the only hill-station in the state.

As in much of India, since the 1960s farmers in Gujarat have increasingly relied on extensive groundwater irrigation to maintain production. In recent years, however, experts have become increasingly alarmed at the rate of water depletion in the state. The water table in Gujarat has been falling steadily for the last 15–20 years, leading to a risk of catastrophic, irreversible saltwater intrusion into the groundwater.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Bailey, Eryn-Ashlei|date=31 December 2010|title=Incentives for Water Conservation in Gujarat|publisher=WaterWideWeb.org |url=http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502164844/http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html|archivedate=2 May 2011|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
The problem is exacerbated because electricity for farmers is subsidised, leaving little incentive to conserve water. To address this issue, the government of Gujarat has begun working with NGOs and universities to create new incentives for water conservation and to promote the adoption of water-saving technologies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water.columbia.edu/?id=India&navid=Gujarat|title=Gujarat, India.|publisher=Columbia Water Centre|accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/01/18/the-worsening-water-crisis-in-gujarat-india/|title=The Worsening Water Crisis in Gujarat, India.|publisher=Columbia Water Centre|accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref>

=== Dinosaur Park Balasinor ===
[[File:Dinosaurs Park.jpg|thumb|Indroda Dinosaur and Fossil Park, Gandhinagar]]
In the early 1980s, palaeontologists stumbled upon dinosaur bones and fossils during a regular geological survey of [[Balasinor]] in [[Kheda District]].<ref name="bbc_jurassic">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8671676.stm The dinosaur wonders of India's Jurassic Park]. BBC News. 11 May 2010.</ref> The find sent ripples of excitement through neighbouring villages and many residents picked up fossilized eggs. Since then excavations have thrown up a veritable trove of dinosaur remains – eggs, bones, and a skeleton which is now kept in a [[Kolkata]] museum – bringing hordes of scientists and tourists to the locale.

Piecing together the evidence present in Balasinor, researchers now believe that Gujarat is home to one of the largest clutch of dinosaur hatcheries in the world. At least 13 species of dinosaurs were present there, possibly for more than 100 million years until their extinction some 66 million years ago. The soft soil made hatching and protecting eggs easier for the animals. So well-protected are the fossilised eggs found here that many researchers call them the best-preserved eggs in the world after the ones found in [[Aix-en-Provence]] in France.

These fossilised dinosaur remains triggered what tourism officials in Gujarat dubbed "Dinosaur Tourism".<ref name="bbc_jurassic"/>

The Ambaji Fair is held in the Hindu month of Bhadrapad (around August–September) at Ambaji, during a time which is particularly suitable for farmers, when the busy monsoon season is about to end.

The Bhadrapad fair is held in the centre of the Ambaji village just outside the temple premises. The village is visited by the largest number of sanghas (pilgrim groups) during the fair. Many of them go there on foot, which is particularly enriching as it happens immediately after the monsoon, when the landscape is rich with greenery, streams are full of sparkling water and the air is fresh. About 1.5&nbsp;million devotees are known to attend this fair each year from all over the world. Not only Hindus, but some devout Jains and Parsis also attend the functions, whilst some Muslims attend the fair for trade.

The [[Tarnetar]] Fair is held during the first week of ''Bhadrapad'', (September–October according to [[Gregorian calendar]]), and mostly serves as a place to find a suitable bride for tribal people from Gujarat.
