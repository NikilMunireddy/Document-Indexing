'''Accra''' {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|k|r|ɑː}} is the [[Capital city|capital]] and [[List of largest Settlements in Ghana (by population)#Top ten largest metropolitan area|largest]] city of [[Ghana]], with an estimated urban population of 2.27 million {{as of|2012|lc=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gh.html |title=Ghana |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}</ref> It is also the capital of the [[Greater Accra Region]] and of the [[Accra Metropolitan Assembly|Accra Metropolitan District]], with which it is coterminous.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ghanadistricts.com/districts/?news&r=1&_=3 |title =Accra Metropolitan|accessdate = 22 July 2010|publisher = GhanaWeb}}</ref> Accra is furthermore the anchor of a larger [[metropolitan area]], the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=jii;view=text;rgn=main;idno=4750978.0016.105 |title =Environmental and Structural Inequalities in Greater Accra |accessdate =22 July 2010|publisher =The Journal of the International Institute}}</ref> which is inhabited by about 4 million people, making it the second-largest metropolitan conglomeration in Ghana by population,<ref name="Metro Population" /> and the [[List of metropolitan areas in Africa|eleventh-largest metropolitan area in Africa]].

Accra stretches along the Ghanaian [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] and extends northern into Ghana interior. Originally built around a port, it served as the capital of the British [[Gold Coast (British Colony)|Gold Coast]] between 1877 and 1957. Once merely a 19th-century suburb of [[Victoriaborg, Accra|Victoriaborg]], Accra has since transitioned into a modern metropolis; the city's architecture reflects this history, ranging from 19th-century [[colonial architecture|architecture buildings]] to modern [[skyscrapers]] and apartment blocks.

Accra serves as the Greater Accra region's economic and administrative hub. It is furthermore a centre of a wide range of nightclubs, restaurants, and hotels.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/geography/accra.php |title = Accra |accessdate = 22 July 2010 | publisher = GhanaWeb}}</ref> Since the early 1990s, a number of new buildings have been built, including the multi-storey French-owned [[Novotel]] hotel. The city's [[National Theatre (Accra)|National Theatre]] was built with Chinese assistance. In 2010, the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]] designated Accra a [[Global city#GaWC study|Gamma-minus]]-level [[world city]], indicating a growing level of international influence and connectedness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2010.html|title=The World According to GaWC 2010|work=Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) Study Group and Network|publisher=[[Loughborough University]]|accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>

The [[central business district]] of Accra contains the city's main banks and department stores, and an area known as the Ministries, where [[Government of Ghana|Ghana's government administration]] is concentrated. Economic activities in Accra include the financial and agricultural sectors, Atlantic fishing, and the manufacture of processed food, lumber, [[plywood]], textiles, clothing, and chemicals. Tourism is soon becoming a thriving business for arts and crafts, history cites and local travel & tour agents. The oxford street in Osu - Accra has grown to become the hub of business and night life in Accra.

{{See also|Timeline of Accra}}
[[File:Christiansborg Castle2.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary drawing of the [[Danish colonial empire|Danish empire]] fort, ''Fort Christiansborg'', now Osu Castle. The outpost to the right is ''Fort Prøvestenen'']]

The main [[Ga people|Ga]] group known as the [[Tumgwa We]] led by [[Ayi Kushie]] arrived by sea. When the [[Guan languages|Guan]] ([[Larteh]]s) on the coast saw them on their canoes at sea, they looked like ants. Hence, the Lartehs refer to them as [[Nkran]] (ants). Nkran was later corrupted by the [[Danes]] to Akra, then to present-day Accra. ''Nkran'' in the [[Ga language]] is ''Gaga'', thus they also started calling themselves Ga. Due to their sheer numbers, the indigenous Lartehs thus relocated to the [[Akuapem]] ridge. The Ga are also part of the main [[Guan]] group that started the initial migration from the [[Nubia Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.akuapem.com/gpage4.html |title = 
The Larteh Story | accessdate = 6 July 2015 | publisher=Akuapem Organisation}}</ref>

Initially, Accra was not the most prominent trading centre; the trade hubs of the time were the ports at [[Ada, Ghana|Ada]] and [[Prampram]], along with the inland centres of [[Dodowa]] and [[Akusa]]. The Dutch built the nearby outposts of James Fort and [[Ussher Fort]]. By the 17th century, Portugal, followed by Sweden, the Netherlands, France, Britain, and Denmark, had constructed forts in the city.

Britain gradually acquired the interests of all other countries beginning in 1851, when Denmark sold [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] and their other forts to the British. The Netherlands was the last to sell out, in 1871. In 1873, after decades of tension between the British and [[Ashanti people|Ashantis]] of the [[peninsula]] country [[Ashantiland]], the British attacked and virtually destroyed the [[Ashantiland]] and Ashanti Region capital of [[Kumasi]]. The British then captured Accra in 1874, and in 1877, at the end of the second [[Anglo-Asante Wars|Anglo-Asante War]], Accra replaced [[Cape Coast]] as the capital of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]. This decision was made because Accra had a drier climate relative to Cape Coast. Until this time, the settlement of Accra was confined between Ussher Fort to the east and the Korle Lagoon to the west.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |title = History of Accra | accessdate = 22 July 2010 | publisher=The African Executive}}</ref>

As the Gold Coast's administrative functions were moved to Accra, an influx of British settlers began, and the city began to expand to accommodate the new residents. Victoriaborg was formed in the late 19th century as an exclusively European residential neighbourhood, located to the east of the city limits of the time. The boundaries of Accra were further stretched in 1908. This expansion entailed the creation of a native-only neighbourhood, intended to accommodate members of the native population as a means of relieving congestion problems in the overcrowded city centre. [[Adabraka]] was thus established to the north of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog261/eskidmore/history.htm |title = History of Accra | accessdate = 17 February 2011}}</ref>

[[File:HauptstraßeAccra18851908 300dpi.jpg|thumb|right|A main street of central Accra between 1885 and 1908]]

One of the most influential decisions in the history of the city was that of building the Accra-Kumasi railway in 1908. This was to connect Accra, the country's foremost port at that time, with Ghana's main [[cocoa bean|cocoa]]-producing regions. In 1923, the railway was completed, and by 1924, cocoa was Ghana's largest export.

The British Gold Coast heavily influenced the shape that Accra took during this period. For example, [[racial segregation]] of neighbourhoods was mandated by law until 1923, and all new buildings were required to be built out of stone or concrete. Despite these regulations, British settlers of the Gold Coast were very hesitant to invest any large amount of money into the city to maintain its infrastructure or improve public works. This did not change until the governorship of [[Gordon Guggisberg|Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]].

Among the achievements of Guggisberg was the building of a bridge across the Korle Lagoon in 1923, which opened the land west of the lagoon for settlement. Guggisberg also oversaw the building of [[hospital]]s and schools. Such improvements led to an increase in Accra’s population due to the [[rural-urban migration|migration of rural dwellers]] into the city, and the immigration of increasing numbers of British businessmen and administrators.

=== After World War II ===
[[File:Jamestown lighthouse.jpg|thumb|upright|<center>Jamestown lighthouse in [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Jamestown/Usshertown]]</center>]]
In the years following [[World War II]], the neighbourhoods of Ridge and Cantonments were planned as low-density developments for Europeans, while many rural migrants settled in neighbourhoods which had not yet been incorporated into Accra's municipal boundary, such as Nima and surrounding areas. Thus, the development of these neighbourhoods was unregulated by the government, creating a crowded and jumbled [[shanty-town]] landscape.

Another area of Accra that took shape at this time was the [[central business district]] (CBD). More administrative buildings were built on High Street, forming a massive judicial/administrative complex. Additionally, the expansion of the economy led to many more commercial buildings being built in the CBD.

In 1944, Accra's city planner Maxwell Fry devised a town plan, which was revised in 1958 by B.D.W. Treavallion and Alan Flood. Although the Fry/Trevallion plan was never followed through, it illustrated the British vision of how Accra should develop.

==== Fry/Treavallion plan ====
In the Fry/Treavallion plan, a reorganisation of the CBD was called for, as well as the development of the coastal region of the city. To reorganise the CBD, the planners decided to superimpose a tight street grid north of Fort Ussher.

To the east of this newly organised CBD, the planners hoped to preserve a broad, open space for a restaurant, country club, and [[polo]] and [[cricket]] fields. Additionally, the British planners intended to build large numbers of public squares, fountains, and ornamental pools and statues throughout the city, as well as a vast Parliament Complex in the city centre. Lastly, the Fry/Treavallion plan included plans to make the coastal region an extension of the exclusive European neighborhood of Victoriaborg, and to create a recreational preserve for the elite. However, the British Gold Coast ended before the Fry/Treavallion plan was enacted.
[[File:Kwame nkrumah tomb accra ghana.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum|Kwame Nkrumah mausoleum]]]]

==== Nkrumah Plan ====
When [[Kwame Nkrumah]] became Ghana's first postindependence [[Prime Minister of Ghana|Prime Minister]] in 1957, he created his own plan for Accra's development. Instead of creating spaces to serve the elite, Nkrumah sought to create spaces to inspire pride and [[nationalism]] in his people and people throughout Africa.

Rather than creating ornamental fountains and a large Parliament complex, Nkrumah decided to build landmarks such as Independence Square, the State House, and the Organisation of African Unity building, and to refurbish Christianborg Castle. Nkrumah decided to leave the Atlantic coastal region undeveloped, so as to not detract attention from the Community Centre or Independence Square, lending both spaces symbolic significance. The Nkrumah plan did not emphasize order nearly as much as the Fry/Treavallion plan did; whereas the British plan strove to lessen crowding in the commercial district and help relieve the overcrowding of neighbourhoods bordering the CBD, the Nkrumah plan allowed for continued compression of commercial establishments into the CBD, as well as increased migration into Jamestown.

=== Present-day Accra ===
The modern city is centred on the original British, [[Denmark|Danish]], and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] forts and their surrounding communities: [[Jamestown, Ghana|Jamestown]] near the British [[James Fort]], [[Osu, Accra|Osu]] near the Danish fort of [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (now [[Osu Castle]]), and [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Ussherstown]] near the Dutch [[Ussher fort]].

Tourist attractions include the National Museum of Ghana, the Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Archives of Ghana and Ghana's central library, the National Theatre, the Accra Centre for National Culture, the Jamestown lighthouse, and the [[Accra Sports Stadium|Ohene Djan Stadium]].

The city is also a transportation hub, home to the [[Kotoka International Airport]], and railway links to [[Tema]], [[Sekondi-Takoradi]] and [[Kumasi]]. Accra has become a location for national and international business conferences, such as the BarCamp Ghana series, organised by GhanaThink Foundation.<ref>[http://www.allconferences.com/Regional/Accra/ Accra Conferences]</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:20120430160030!The National Archives UK - CO 1069-40-37.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial photograph 7 November 1929]]
Central Accra is compact, centered on the historical British, Danish, and Dutch forts. Over the years, however, with immigration from rural areas, the city has expanded with no regard to zoning, giving it a sprawled attribute. The city of Accra has a total area of {{convert|173|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, and is the anchor city of the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), which is made up of the Accra Metropolitan District, Tema Metropolitan District, Ga South Municipal District, Ga East Municipal District, Ga West Municipal District, Adenta Municipal District, Ashaiman Municipal District, Ledzokuku-Krowor Municipal District, and the town of Kasoa in the Awutu Senya District of the [[Central Region, Ghana|Central Region]].

The intersection of the Lafa stream and Mallam junction serves as the western border of the city. The Great Hall of the [[University of Ghana]] forms Accra's northern border, while the Nautical College forms the eastern border. The [[Gulf of Guinea]] forms the southern border. These borders notwithstanding, points of conflict with adjoining districts exist, resulting in a ''de facto'' shrinking of the city limits in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3055 |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |date= |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref>

Owing to its location in the [[Dahomey Gap]], where the coast runs parallel to the prevailing moist monsoonal winds, Accra features a [[tropical savanna climate]] that borders on a [[semiarid climate]]. The average annual rainfall is about 730&nbsp;mm, which falls primarily during Ghana's two rainy seasons. The chief rainy season begins in April and ends in mid-July, whilst a weaker second rainy season occurs in October. Rain usually falls in short intensive storms and causes local flooding in which drainage channels are obstructed.

Very little variation in temperature occurs throughout the year. The mean monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|24.7|°C|°F|1}} in August (the coolest) to {{convert|28|°C|°F|1}} in March (the hottest), with an annual average of {{convert|26.8|°C|°F|1}}. The "cooler" months tend to be more [[humid]] than the warmer months. As a result, during the warmer months and particularly during the windy [[harmattan]] season, the city experiences a breezy "dry heat" that feels less warm than the "cooler" but more humid rainy season.

As a coastal city, Accra is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise, with population growth putting increasing pressure on the coastal areas.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf Using climate information to achieve long-term development objectives in coastal Ghana and Mozambique]. [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], accessed 2015-04-16</ref> Drainage infrastructure is particularly at risk, which has profound implications for people’s livelihoods, especially in informal settlements. Inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement, as well as perceived corruption in government processes, lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government coordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of Accra’s drainage infrastructure, according to the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]].<ref>[http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/  Future Climate for Africa]. [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], accessed 2015-04-16</ref>

As Accra is close to the [[equator]], the daylight hours are practically uniform during the year. Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the midafternoon to 95% at night. The predominant wind direction in Accra is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16&nbsp;km/h. High wind gusts occur with [[thunderstorm]]s, which generally pass in [[squalls]] along the coast.

The maximum wind speed record in Accra is 107.4&nbsp;km/h (58 knots). Strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material. Several areas of Accra experience microclimatic effects. Low-profile [[drainage basin]]s with a north-south orientation are not as well ventilated as those oriented east-west.

Air is often trapped in pockets over the city, and an insulation effect can give rise to a local increase in air temperature of several degrees. This occurs most notably in the Accra Newtown sports complex areas.

{{Main|Neighborhoods of Accra}}

The growth of Accra in recent decades due to [[immigration]] from the Americas, European, Asian, including African nationals and other nationals from all over the world, has outstripped the provision of services such as waste collection, potable water and electricity. Because of immigration there has been a rise of large [[slum]]s. Accra currently has 9 slums. All nine slum [[Human settlement|settlements]] and the so-called "[[Sodom and Gomorrah]]" shanty towns are being demolished because of their negative effect on the environment.<ref>{{cite news |title=AMA to overhaul Accra's slums - Nima, Maamobi |url=http://edition.myjoyonline.com/pages/news/201001/40331.php |work=MyJoyOnline |date=9 January 2010}}</ref> A shortage in the supply of electricity has led to Accra having frequent planned and rolling power cuts with several areas of the city in turn being without power. These cuts have been blamed on various issues such as machine failure and shortage of fuel.<ref>[http://www.spyghana.com/govt-hide-behind-equipment-failure-as-justification-for-power-cuts/ Gov't hide behind equipment failure as justification for power cuts]. 20 March 2014. Retrieved 20 March 2014.</ref>

==== Accra Central ====
The Ring Road, extending from the Korle Lagoon in the west, north to Kwame Nkrumah Circle, following east to the juncture of Independence Avenue, and continuing on to [[Osu, Accra|Osu]], forms a ring around the oldest districts of Accra, and separates central Accra from the outlying suburbs.

Central Accra includes the CBD, which consists of the historic districts of [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Usshertown]], Tudu, [[Victoriaborg, Accra|Victoriaborg]], [[West Ridge, Accra|West Ridge]], and [[East Ridge, Accra|East Ridge]], as well as the historic residential districts of [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Jamestown]], [[Adabraka]], Asylum Down, [[North Ridge, Accra|North Ridge]] and [[Osu, Accra|Christiansborg/Osu]].

Although satellite business districts such as the Airport City have been established across the city, Central Accra remains the administrative and cultural centre of Accra, hosting government ministries, hotels, businesses, and financial institutions.

Central Accra's principal attractions include the [[Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum]], the [[National Museum of Ghana|National Museum]], [[Independence Arch (Accra)|Independence Square]], the [[National Theatre (Accra)|National Theatre]], and the [[Ohene Djan Stadium]].

==== Accra North ====

Northern Accra is a residential and business district. The area contains the "37" Military Hospital, [[The Flagstaff House]], several foreign [[embassy|embassies]], [[Achimota School]], Achimota Golf Park, and the [[University of Ghana]]'s Legon campus, which serves as Accra's northern boundary.

Geographically, the areas north of Ring Road West and Central, east of Winneba/Graphic Road, west of Liberation Road, and the districts just north and south of the Kwame Nkrumah motorway are regarded as Northern Accra.

==== Accra East ====
Eastern Accra is largely residential and geographically north of Ring Road East, stretching as far north as Kwame Nkrumah Motorway; the district is bordered to the west by Liberation Road.

==== Accra West ====
Western Accra is largely a residential and business area. Whilst geographically less expansive than the northern and eastern reaches of the city as a result of the large saltponds of Tettegu and Aplaku, it nonetheless boasts one of Accra's most important landmarks, the [[Korle Bu Teaching Hospital]].

Geographically, the areas west of Ring Road West, extending as far west as the saltponds and south of Graphic Road, are considered Accra West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&rlv=climate |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |date= |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref>

== Demographics ==
The period between 1960 and 1970 saw rapid industrialisation and expansion in Accra's manufacturing and commercial sectors. This contributed to high [[rural-urban migration]] to the city, and consequently a high population growth rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |date= |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> The stagnation of the Ghanaian economy during the 1970s slowed the growth of Accra’s population, as shown by the falling growth rate of the 1970–1984 intercensal years. Later, however, the decline in agriculture in rural communities in Ghana and rising industrialisation in urban regions, coupled with the late-1980s boom in the [[service sector]], once again propelled immigration to Accra. The primacy of the Accra Metropolitan Area as the Greater Accra region's administrative, educational, industrial and commercial centre continues to be the major force for its population growth, with immigration contributing to over 35% of the Accra's population growth.

=== Distribution and density ===
The gross density of population for the Accra Metropolitan Area in 2000 was 10.03 persons per hectare, compared to 6.23 per hectare in 1970. The highest densities were recorded in the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, with an overall average of 69.3 persons per hectare. At the community level, densities exceeding 250 persons per hectare occurred mostly in the immigrant and depressed areas in the oldest parts of Accra, such as Accra New Town, Nima, James Town and Ussher Town. In higher-income areas, densities ranged between 17.5 and 40 persons per hectare.

=== Population distribution by age and gender ===
Accra’s population is a very youthful one, with 56% of the population being under 24 years of age. This predominance of young people is not expected to decline in the foreseeable future. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the population are females, and the remaining 49% males. This gives a males-to-females ratio of 1:1.04. The greater number of females is a reflection of the nationwide trend, where the estimated ratio of males to females is 1:1.03.

=== Migration ===
Decentralisation is expected to reduce the migration rates in Accra. An assessment of the extent of migration to Accra, based on present locality and gender, reveals that 45% of residents in Accra are African immigrants from countries across the African continent.

=== Housing characteristics ===


Parts of inner-city Accra comprise a mixture of very low-density development with under-utilised service infrastructure on the one hand, high-density development and overstretched infrastructure services on the other. The growth of Accra has led to the neglect of some of the old settlements, whilst efforts are being made to provide the newly developing suburban areas with services and infrastructure to cater for the needs of the middle-income earners. Peripheral residential development in Accra barely has sufficient infrastructure to support it. There are also large numbers of uncompleted houses, interspersed with pockets of undeveloped land, which are often subject of litigation, due to the inability of organisations and individuals who own them to complete or develop them due to lack of funds. Housing can be grouped into three broad categories: the low-income, middle-income and high-income areas. The low-income housing areas comprise Osu, Jamestown, Adedenkpo, Chorkor, La, Teshie, Nungua, Sukura, Kwashieman, Odorkor, Bubiashie, Abeka, Nima, Maamobi and Chorkor. Altogether, these areas accommodate about 58% of Accra’s total population. Most of the city's informal businesses are located in low-income areas.

=== Housing conditions ===

Almost all low-income areas are built up with little room for expansion. This is particularly so in the areas of the inner city. The middle-income areas of Accra are predominantly populated by Ghanaian citizens and business, administrative and professional families. Much of the housing in these areas has been provided by state, parastatal and private sector organisations and individuals. The middle-income areas include Dansoman Estates, North Kaneshie Estates, Asylum Down, Kanda Estates, Abelempke, Achimota,Adenta and Tesano. Usually, these areas, unlike the low-income areas, are planned developments, but are in need of infrastructure services. Building materials and general housing conditions are of better quality. The middle-income group comprises 32% of the city's population of which are Ghanaian citizens make up. The high-income areas provide housing for the remaining 10% of the population of which Ghanaian citizens also make up. They include areas like North Ridge and West Ridge, Ringway Estates, north Labone Estates, Airport Residential Area, Roman Ridge, East Legon.
 These areas are all planned and have well developed infrastructure with spacious and landscaped ground in sharp contrast with, particularly, the low-income areas. Buildings are usually built with [[sandcrete]] blocks, and have walls and roofed with [[aluminium]], or [[asbestos]] roofing sheets. There are also high-income peripheral areas like Haatso, Kwabenya, Pokuase, Adenta, Taifa, Mallam, where development of engineering infrastructure is not yet complete. These areas developed ahead of infrastructure, however the Achimota-Ofankor [[controlled-access highway]] was scheduled to open in May 2012,{{Update inline|date=December 2014}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/383369/achimota-ofankor-road-to-open-to-traffic-in-may.html |title=Achimota-Ofankor Road To Open To Traffic In May |work=graphic.com.gh |publisher=[[Daily Graphic (Ghana)]] |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2016 |via=Modern Ghana}}</ref> and the [http://www.presidency.gov.gh/press-centre/general-news/president-cuts-sod-awoshie-pokuase-road Awoshie-Pokuase]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/Ghana-Awoshie-Pokuase%20Road%20ESIA%20Summary%20board%20board%2020%201%2009.pdf |title=Ghana: Awoshie-Pokuase Road Projet |work= | publisher=afdb.org |date= |accessdate=}}</ref> [[dual carriageway]] [[road construction]] was also due to be completed in 2012.{{Update inline|date=December 2014}} In total, 84.4% of all houses in the Accra Metropolitan Area have their outside walls made up of [[cement]].

== Government ==
{{main|Accra Metropolitan Assembly|Mayor of Accra}}


Accra has a mayoral council government system of the [[Accra Metropolitan Assembly]] (AMA) in which the [[mayor]] is vested with extensive executive powers. The mayor is appointed by the [[President of Ghana|President]] of the Republic of [[Ghana]] and approved by the city council, although the public has expressed a desire to increase mayoral accountability by holding free mayoral elections. The [[Mayor of Accra]] is [[Alfred Vanderpuije]], appointed by President [[John Atta Mills]] in 2009.

The Accra Assembly has 104 members. Of these, 70% are elected and 30% are government appointees. The Town and Country Planning Department is responsible for land-use planning in the metropolis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3037 |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |date= |accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref>

=== Sectors of the economy ===
The sectors of Accra's economy consist of the primary, secondary (manufacturing, electricity, gas, water, construction) and tertiary sectors ([[supermarket]]s, [[shopping mall]]s, hotel, restaurant, transportation, storage, communication, financial intermediation, real estate service, public administration, education, health and other social services). The tertiary service sector is the city's largest, employing about 531,670 people. The second-largest, the secondary sector, employs 22.34% of the labor force, or around 183,934 people. 12.2% of the city's workforce are reportedly unemployed, totalling around 114,198 people.<ref name="ghanadistricts1" />

=== Primary sector ===
[[File:Overzicht baai met boten in de zee - Accra - 20375372 - RCE.jpg|thumb|Licensed and Commercial [[fishing vessel]]s off the [[coast]] of Accra.]]
Accra's smallest economic sector, the primary sector, employs approximately 91,556 people. The predominant economic activities are [[fishery]] and [[urban agriculture]], with fishery accounting for 78% of production labour. Urban agriculture in Accra centres on the growth of vegetables, several crops and [[poultry]]. The [[fishery]] industry is the most important sub-sector, with 10% of the catch being exported and the rest consumed locally. The industry is characterized by extreme seasonableness, operating primarily between June and September. Although most deep-water Atlantic fishing around Accra takes place in the June–September period, fishery operations take place close to the shore throughout the year, and there are clear indications of the [[overfishing|depletion of fish stocks]] in the near future. Fishing operations are most prominent at the Jamestown, La, Teshie, Nungua and Chorkor fishing shores.

== Education ==

=== Pre-school ===
Pre-school comprises nursery and kindergarten. In 2001, there was 7,923 children (3,893 girls and 4,030 boys) in [[pre-school]]s in Accra. In 2010, the enrollment rate at Pre-school was 98%.<ref name="UNICEF At a glance: Ghana – Statistics">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/ghana_statistics.html|title=UNICEF At a glance: Ghana – Statistics|work=unicef.org |publisher=[[UNICEF]] |accessdate=5 April 2012}}</ref> Pre-schools are regulated by the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare, and are mostly privately owned and operated. In 2001, there were 62 government-owned pre-schools in the Accra metropolis.

=== Junior high school (JHS) ===
The Junior High School is part of Ghana's basic education program. Its nationwide implementation began on 29 September 1987.

In the 2001/2002 academic year, 61,080 pupils had enrolled in Accra, representing 57.17% of the 129,467 school-age 12–to-14-year-olds. In 2010, the enrollment rate at Junior high school level was 95%.<ref name="UNICEF At a glance: Ghana – Statistics" /> The ratio of girls is also higher at this level.<ref name="UNICEF At a glance: Ghana – Statistics" />

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===
Transportation by means of road is the major form of transportation in Accra. The rail system is not effective and patronized by only a few. It is not common to see trains in town.

==== Rapid transit ====
Recently, plans have been afoot to develop a more advanced rapid transit bus system for the city and its metropolitan area. This project is aimed at creating an "integrated, efficient, cost-effective and sustainable transportation system responsive to the needs of society, and supporting growth".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/143322/1/us95m-voted-to-solve-accra-kumasi-transport-proble.html |title=US$95m VOTED TO SOLVE ACCRA, KUMASI TRANSPORT PROBLEMS &#124; General News &#124; ModernGhana.com News |publisher=Modernghana.com |date=

===== Bus Rapid Transit =====
In 2003, the [[Metro mass Transit L.T.D|Metro Mass Transit Service]], was inaugurated in Accra as a more comfortable and cheaper alternative to the trotro. The country's first BRT system is also planned for the city, with the first phase to commence by the end of 2015.

===== Rail =====
Accra is connected by railway line to [[Kumasi]] and [[Takoradi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uktradeinvest.gov.uk/ukti/appmanager/ukti/countries;jsessionid=KTBQpDl6Xp1jtjp4NLphhKn0cT23s7p5jtpJ3DnkJcy1PSjz0Zds!89531318!NONE?_nfpb=true&portlet_3_5_actionOverride=/pub/portlets/genericViewer/showContentItem&_windowLabel=portlet_3_5&portlet_3_5navigationPageId=/ghana&portlet_3_5navigationContentPath=/BEA+Repository/326/226985&_pageLabel=CountryType1 |title=Ghana |publisher=UK Trade and Investment |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=29 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110727185426/https://www.uktradeinvest.gov.uk/ukti/appmanager/ukti/countries;jsessionid=KTBQpDl6Xp1jtjp4NLphhKn0cT23s7p5jtpJ3DnkJcy1PSjz0Zds!89531318!NONE?_nfpb=true&portlet_3_5_actionOverride=/pub/portlets/genericViewer/showContentItem&_windowLabel=portlet_3_5&portlet_3_5navigationPageId=/ghana&portlet_3_5navigationContentPath=/BEA+Repository/326/226985&_pageLabel=CountryType1 |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}</ref> The suburban rail line between Accra and [[Tema]] is under redevelopment to provide a rail link between both cities.

Accra is served by [[Kotoka International Airport]], which has both civil and military uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldaerodata.com/wad.cgi?id=GH02526&sch=DGAA|title=Kotoka International Airport|publisher=World Aero Data|year=2009|accessdate=29 October 2009}}</ref> Located {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} from downtown Accra, the airport handles all of the city's [[scheduled air transport|scheduled passenger services]]. There are plans to build a second airport to relieve the aviation pressure on the Kotoka International Airport. This new airport will be located at Prampram in Accra and will be constructed by China Airport Civil Construction.

==== Taxis ====
[[File:Ghana street scene.jpg|left|thumb|<center>Accra Taxi</center>]]
Accra has an extensive [[taxicab|taxi]] network and numerous [[taxi rank]]s, but most taxis lack a meter system, so price negotiation is required between the passenger and driver. Metered taxis do operate in the city, but tend to be more expensive. Taxis in Ghana are painted in two colours: the four bumpers [[fender (vehicle)|fenders]] are yellow/orange, and the rest of the car is in a colour of the operator's choice.

==== Trotros and Buses ====
{{further|Tro tro|Metro Mass Transit Company Limited}}
By far the most common form of transport in Accra, ''[[tro tro]]s'' (motor vehicles re-purposed for passenger transport) is the third biggest, and second most efficient and cost-effective way of getting around the city. The buses are typically minibuses or vans, with the most popular being Nissan Urvan 15-seaters and Mercedes Benz Sprinter or D 309 vans. Trotros are typically decorated with flags and stickers of various countries or (local and international) soccer teams, and with witty sayings, wisecracks, local proverbs (in English or local languages) or Bible verses printed on the bus's rear. Trotros stop at any bus stop or gathering of people, and can also be found at truck and taxi stations, such as the Neoplan station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beautifulghana.com/content/view/41/82/lang,en/ |title=Transportation &#124; Ghana, Accra, Transport, Car, Trotros |publisher=Beautiful Ghana |date=1 May 2006 |accessdate=5 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100621083850/http://www.beautifulghana.com/content/view/41/82/lang,en/| archivedate= 21 June 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
