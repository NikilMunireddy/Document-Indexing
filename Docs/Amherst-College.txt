Amherst has historically had close relationships and rivalries with [[Williams College]] and [[Wesleyan University]] which form the [[Little Three]] colleges.

These include [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].

==History==

=== Founding and 19th century ===
[[Image:Amherst College Main Quad.jpg|thumb|right|Amherst College Main Quad|250x250px]]
Founded in 1821, Amherst College developed out of the secondary school Amherst Academy. The college was originally suggested as an alternative to [[Williams College]], which was struggling to stay open. Although Williams remained open, Amherst was formed and diverged from its Williams roots into an individual institution.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/amherst-story/facts/history|title=History of Amherst {{!}} Amherst College|website=www.amherst.edu|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref>

In 1812, funds were raised in Amherst for a secondary school, Amherst Academy; it opened December 1814.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/historyofamhers00tyle#page/34/mode/2up History of Amherst College during its first half century 1821-1871]. Archive.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-02.</ref> The institution was named after the town, which in turn had been named after [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery, Lord Amherst]], a veteran from the [[Seven Years' War]] and later commanding general of the British forces in North America. On November 18, 1817, a project was adopted at the Academy to raise funds for the free instruction of "indigent young men of promising talents and hopeful piety, who shall manifest a desire to obtain a liberal education with a sole view to the Christian ministry."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter01/menu.html|title=A History of Amherst College (1894) -- Chapter 1|website=www3.amherst.edu|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref> This required a substantial investment from benefactors.<ref name=":0" />

During the fundraising for the project, it became clear that without larger designs, it would be impossible to raise sufficient funds. This led the committee overseeing the project to conclude that a new institution should be created. On August 18, 1818, the Amherst Academy board of trustees accepted this conclusion and began building a new college.<ref name=":0" />

===Establishment===
[[Zephaniah Swift Moore|Moore]], then [[List of Williams College Presidents|President of Williams College]], however, still believed that [[Williamstown, Massachusetts|Williamstown]] was an unsuitable location for a college, and with the advent of Amherst College was elected its first president on May 8, 1821.  At its opening, Amherst had forty-seven students. Fifteen of these had followed Moore from Williams College. Those fifteen represented about one-third of the whole number at Amherst, and about one-fifth of the whole number in the three classes to which they belonged in Williams College. President Moore died on June 29, 1823, and was replaced with a Williams College trustee, Heman Humphrey.  Williams alumni are fond of an apocryphal story ascribing the removal of books from the Williams College library to Amherst College, but there is no contemporaneous evidence to verify the story. In 1995, Williams president [[Harry C. Payne]] declared the story false, but many still nurture the legend.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter01/menu.html|title=A History of Amherst College (1894) -- Chapter 1|website=www3.amherst.edu|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref>

Amherst grew quickly, and for two years in the mid-1830s it was the second largest college in the United States, second only to [[Yale College|Yale]]. In 1835, Amherst attempted to create a course of study parallel to the classical liberal arts education. This parallel course focused less on [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]], instead focusing on [[English studies|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[chemistry]], [[economics]], etc. The parallel course did not take hold, however, until the next century.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www3.amherst.edu/~rjyanco94/amherst/history/1894tyler-ws/chapter01/menu.html|title=A History of Amherst College (1894) -- Chapter 1|website=www3.amherst.edu|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref>

Amherst was founded as a non-sectarian institution "for the classical education of indigent young men of piety and talents for the Christian ministry." (Tyler, ''A History of Amherst College'')  One of the hallmarks of the new college was its Charity Fund, an early form of financial aid that paid the tuition of poorer students.<ref name="NEcollege">{{cite book|author=Claude Moore Feuss|title=Amherst: Story of a New England College}}</ref>  Although officially non-denominational, the initial Amherst was widely seen as a religiously conservative institution with a strong connection to Calvinism, and as a result, there was considerable debate in the Massachusetts government over whether the new college should receive an official charter from the state, and a charter was not granted until February 21, 1825.<ref name="NEcollege" /> As a result of the official charter being granted four years after the official founding of the college, the Amherst seal lists a date of 1825.  A tradition of religious conservatism persisted at Amherst until the mid-nineteenth century; students who consumed alcohol or played cards were subject to expulsion, and there were a number of religious revivals at Amherst where mobs of righteous students would herd less religious students into the chapel and berate them for lack of piety.<ref name="NEcollege" /> Towards the end of the nineteenth century, however, the college began a transition towards secularism, culminating in the demolishing of the college church in 1949.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley King|title="The Consecrated Eminence": The Story of the Campus and Buildings of Amherst College |location=Amherst, Mass. |publisher=Amherst College |year=1951 |origyear=1952 |oclc=2747723}}</ref>

Academic hoods in the United States are traditionally lined with the official colors of the school, in theory so watchers can tell where the hood wearer earned his or her degree. Amherst's hoods are purple (Williams' official color) with a white stripe or chevron, said to signify that Amherst was born of Williams. Amherst records one of the first uses of [[Latin honors]] of any American college, dating back to 1881.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/0450/ChairsUpdateWebReady5-29-07.pdf|title = Annual Fund Update|date = May 29, 2007|accessdate = August 15, 2013|website = Amherst College}}</ref> The college was an all-male school until the late 1960s, when a few female students from nearby schools in the Five-College Consortium attended on an experimental basis. In October 1974, the faculty voted in favor of coeducation and in November 1974 the board of trustees voted to admit female students starting in the 1975-1976 school year. In 1975, nine women who were already attending classes as part of an inter-college exchange program were admitted as transfer students. In June 1976, they became the first female graduates of the college.<ref>[https://www.amherst.edu/library/archives/exhibitions/coed25 Coeducation: 25 years | Amherst College]. Amherst.edu. Retrieved on 2014-04-12.</ref>

The college established the Black Studies Department in 1969. In 1973, it launched the nation's first undergraduate neuroscience program. In 1983, it established a Department of Asian Languages and Literatures, which was later to become the Department of Asian Languages and Civilizations.<ref name="amherst.edu">{{cite web |url = https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/facts/history/timeline|title = An Amherst Timeline|website = Amherst College|accessdate = 2015-08-28|archive-url = https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/history/timeline|archive-date = 2013-11-06}}</ref> 
 
In 1984, on-campus fraternities were abolished. The former fraternity buildings, which were owned by the college, were converted into residence halls.<ref name="amherst.edu"/>

The Department of Women's and Gender Studies was established in 1987 and the Department of Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought in 1993.<ref name="amherst.edu"/>

=== Academic freedom debate ===
The writings of Amherst College political science Professor [[Hadley Arkes]] about homosexuality led to a dispute in 2013 over whether a college seeking to create a diverse, respectful academic community should speak out when a faculty member disparages community members or should instead remain silent as a way to protect academic freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldmag.com/2015/04/hadley_arkes_the_right_stuff|title=WORLD {{!}} Hadley Arkes: The right stuff {{!}} Marvin Olasky {{!}} April 18, 2015|website=WORLD|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref> The issue arose when a group of alumni petitioned the college trustees and President Biddy Martin to “dissociate the institution” from Arkes’s “divisive and destructive” views,<ref name="terrasirradient.org">[http://terrasirradient.org/2013/10/18/petition-to-cullen-murphy-chair-of-amherst-college-board-of-trustees/ Petition to the Amherst College board of trustees | Amherst Against Homophobia].

Martin disagreed, citing past debates over the college’s position on Vietnam War and apartheid in South Africa—issues on which the college initially remained silent but eventually took a public position. In such times, she said, colleges should “avoid taking institutional positions on controversial political matters, except in extraordinary circumstances” and should simultaneously both “protect their communities from discrimination and disrespect” and “cherish a diversity of viewpoints.”<ref>[https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/president/reflections President's Reflections | Amherst College].

===Five College Consortium===
Amherst is a member of the [[Five College Consortium|Five Colleges]] consortium, which allows its students to attend classes at four other [[Pioneer Valley]] institutions. These include [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]], [[Hampshire College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. In addition to the 850 courses available on campus, Amherst students have an additional 5,300 classes to consider through the Consortium (without paying additional tuition) and access to 8 million library volumes. The Five Colleges are geographically close to one another and are linked by [[Pioneer Valley Transit Authority|buses that run between the campuses]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fivecolleges.edu/libraries|title=Libraries {{!}} www.fivecolleges.edu|website=www.fivecolleges.edu|access-date=2016-04-21}}</ref>

The Five Colleges share resources and develop common academic programs. [[Museums10]] is a consortium of local art, history and science museums. The Five College Dance Department is one of the largest in the nation.<ref>[https://www.fivecolleges.edu/dance/ Five College Dance Department]</ref> The joint Astronomy department shares use of the [[Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory]], which contributed to work that won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.astro.umass.edu/~fcrao/telescope/ | title = The Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory  | accessdate =January 1, 2012}}</ref>

==Student life==

===Students===
Amherst's resources, faculty, and academic life allow the college to enroll students with a range of talents, interests, and commitments. Students represent all fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and fifty countries. Ninety-seven percent of students live on campus. Ninety-seven percent of Amherst freshmen return for their sophomore year; ninety-six percent graduate, among the highest retention and graduation rates in the country.  There are more than 140 student groups at Amherst.<ref>[https://www.amherst.edu/aboutamherst/glance Amherst at a Glance | Amherst College]. Amherst.edu (2012-06-30). Retrieved on 2013-08-02.</ref> Students pursue their interests through student-led organizations funded by the student government, including a variety of cultural and religious groups, publications, fine and performing arts and political advocacy and service groups. Groups include a medieval sword-fighting club, a knitting club, and a club devoted to random acts of kindness, among others.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/campuslife/aas/clubs|title=Clubs {{!}} Amherst College|website=www.amherst.edu|access-date=2016-04-22}}</ref> Community service groups and opportunities (locally—through the Center for Community Engagement, nationally, and internationally) have been a priority at Amherst and for former President [[Anthony Marx]], who helped start a secondary school for black students in apartheid South Africa.<ref name="campus-revolutionary">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-02-26/campus-revolutionary |title=Campus Revolutionary |publisher=Business Week}}</ref>
