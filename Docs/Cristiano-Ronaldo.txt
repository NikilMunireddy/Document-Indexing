Ronaldo has undergone several tactical evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditional [[Winger (association football)|winger]] on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace, agility, and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations, often displaying an array of [[Association football tactics and skills|tricks]] and [[Dummy (football)|feints]], such as the [[stepover]]s with which he became widely associated.<ref name="Cristiano Ronaldo - Portogallo"/><ref name="Grantland">{{cite web |first=Mike L. |last=Goodman |title= The Evolution of Cristiano Ronaldo |work=Grantland |url= http://grantland.com/the-triangle/the-evolution-of-cristiano-ronaldo-real-madrid-manchester-united/ |date=22 September 2015 |accessdate=25 April 2016}}</ref> In his youth, he also regularly undertook individual [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] runs.<ref name="Evolution"/> As he matured, he underwent a major physical transformation, developing a muscular body type that allows him to retain possession of the ball.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1386948/cristiano-ronaldo-named-fittest-man-alive-by-mens-health-magazine-photos/ |title=Cristiano Ronaldo Named Fittest Man Alive By Men’s Health Magazine |publisher=Inquisitr |accessdate=3 August 2014}}</ref> Concurrently with his increased work-rate and strength, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing, where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He increasingly played a [[playmaker|creative role]] for his team, participating in build-up plays courtesy of his good vision and passing ability.<ref name="Evolution"/>
