Action-adventure game

{{VG Action}}
The '''action-adventure game''' genre is a [[video game genre]] that combines elements of the [[action game]] and [[adventure game]] genres. It is perhaps the broadest and most diverse genre in gaming, and can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres.

With the decline of the adventure game genre from mainstream popularity, the use of the term (and the hybrid term "action-adventure") has been more liberal. It is not uncommon for gamers to apply the term "adventure" or "action adventure" to describe the genre of fiction to which a game belongs, and not the gameplay itself.

Action-adventure is a hybrid genre, and thus the definition is very inclusive, leading it to be perhaps the broadest genre of video games. Typically, pure adventure games have situational problems for the player to solve, with very little or no action. If there is action, it is generally confined to isolated minigames. Pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge the reflexes. Therefore, action-adventure games engage both reflexes and problem-solving, in both violent and non-violent situations.

==Definition==
An action-adventure game can be defined as a game with a mix of elements from an [[action game]] and an [[adventure game]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rollins |first=A. |last2=Morris |first2=D. |title=Game Architecture and Design |publisher=Coriolis Ed |year=2000}}</ref> especially crucial elements like puzzles.<ref name=Puzzle1>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2917/designing_and_integrating_puzzles_.php?page=1|title=Designing and Integrating Puzzles in Action-Adventure Games|last=Luban|first=Pascal|page=1|work=Gamasutra|publisher=Think Services Game Group|date=2002-12-06|accessdate=2009-02-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221140043/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2917/designing_and_integrating_puzzles_.php?page=1| archivedate= 21 December 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Action-adventures require many of the same physical skills as action games, but also offer a storyline, numerous characters, an inventory system, dialogue, and other features of adventure games.<ref name="fundamentals">{{cite book|last=Rollings|first=Andrew|authorlink=|author2=Ernest Adams|title=Fundamentals of Game Design|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2006|location=|url=http://wps.prenhall.com/bp_gamedev_1/54/14053/3597646.cw/index.html|isbn=0-13-168747-6}}</ref> They are faster-paced than pure adventure games, because they include both physical and conceptual challenges.<ref name="fundamentals"/> Action-adventure games normally include a combination of complex story elements, which are displayed for players using audio and video. The story is heavily reliant upon the [[player character]]'s movement, which triggers story events and thus affects the flow of the game.<ref name=Puzzle2>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2917/designing_and_integrating_puzzles_.php?page=2|title=Designing and Integrating Puzzles in Action-Adventure Games|last=Luban|first=Pascal|page=2|work=Gamasutra|publisher=Think Services Game Group|date=2002-12-06|accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref> Some examples of action-adventure games include ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'', ''[[God of War (series)|God of War]]'',<ref name="fundamentals"/> and ''[[Tomb Raider (series)|Tomb Raider]]'' series.<ref name="Gal">{{Cite book |last=Gal |first=Viviane |last2=Le Prado |first2=Cécile |last3=Natkin |first3=Stéphane |last4=Vega |first4=Liliana |title=Writing for Video Games |publisher=Proceedings Laval Ritual (IVRC) |year=2002 |url=http://cedric.cnam.fr/PUBLIS/RC359.pdf}}</ref>

Exactly when a game stops being an adventure game and becomes an action game is a matter of interpretation.<ref name="Rollings"/> There are quite a few disagreements in the community and in the media over what actually constitutes an action-adventure game. One definition of the term "action adventure" may be '"An action/adventure game is a game that has enough action in it not to be called an adventure game, but not enough action to be called an action game."<ref name=justadventure>{{cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/articles/ActionAdventures/AA.shtm|title=A Brief - But Comprehensive - History of the Action/Adventure Genre|author=Aya|date=2005-08-02|accessdate=2009-02-04| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090129103800/http://justadventure.com/articles/ActionAdventures/AA.shtm| archivedate= 29 January 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In some cases an action game with puzzles will be classified as an action-adventure game, but if these puzzles are quite simple they might be classified as an action game.<ref name="fundamentals"/> Others see action games as a pure genre, while an action-adventure is an action game that includes situational problem-solving.<ref name=justadventure /> Adventure gamers may also be purists, rejecting any game that makes use of physical challenges or time pressure.<ref name="fundamentals"/> Regardless, the action-adventure label is prominent in articles over the internet and media. The term "action-adventure" is usually substituted for a particular subgenre due to its wide scope.

==Subgenres==
Although action-adventure games are diverse and difficult to classify, there are some distinct subgenres. Popular subgenres include:

* '''First-person action-adventure''', which make use of [[first-person shooter]] gameplay, forgoing constant action in favor of important adventure game elements such as environmental problem-solving and a complex plot. These are sometimes called Real-Time Adventure games or RTAs for short. Notable examples of this include ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', ''[[Dishonored]]'', and ''[[Far Cry 3]]''.
* '''Third-person action-adventure''', in which gameplay is in the [[Third person (video games)|third-person]]. Notable examples include games like the ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' series, ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, ''Rune'', ''[[Severance: Blade of Darkness]]'', the ''[[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, the ''[[Hitman (video game series)|Hitman]]'' series and the ''[[Uncharted]]'' series.
* '''[[Isometric adventure game|Isometric platform games]]''', which feature freely explorable environments with three-dimensional gameplay and two-dimensional graphics using an [[Isometric graphics in video games|isometric projection]].
* '''[[Open world|Sandbox/Open world]] action-adventure''', which focus on [[nonlinear gameplay]] in an open world. Notable examples include the ''[[Grand Theft Auto (series)|Grand Theft Auto]]'' series, ''[[The Legend of Zelda|The Legend of Zelda series,]]'' and ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series.
* '''[[Platform Game#Platform-adventure games|Platform-adventure games]]''', which emphasize both exploration and puzzle solving, but also feature traditional platform game conventions. Examples of games of this type are ''[[Tomb Raider]]'' series, the ''[[Banjo-Kazooie (series)|Banjo-Kazooie]]'' series, [[Super Mario]] series and the ''[[Metroid]]'' and ''[[Castlevania]]'' games; the term "[[Metroidvania]]" is derived from these latter two and used to describe games in this genre that generally are based on two-dimensional platformers.
* '''[[Stealth game]]s''', which emphasize avoiding detection by enemies rather than engaging them in direct combat, leading to a greater emphasis on exploration and puzzle-solving than other types of action games. Notable examples include the ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series, the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, and the ''[[Hitman (video game series)|Hitman]]'' series.
* '''[[Survival horror game]]s''', which emphasize "inventory management" and making sure the player has enough ammunition and recovery items to "survive" the horror setting. Survival-horror is a thematic genre with diverse gameplay, however, so not all survival horror games share these features. The ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and ''[[Silent Hill]]'' franchises popularized this subgenre and stand to date as the most popular franchises of its kind.

They are distinct from [[Graphic adventure game|graphic adventures]], which sometimes have free-moving central characters, but also wider variety of commands and fewer or no action game elements and are distinct too from [[text adventures]], characterized by many different commands introduced by the user via a complex [[text parser]] and no free-moving character. While they share general gameplay dynamics, action-adventures vary widely in the design of their viewpoints, including [[bird's-eye view|bird's eye]], side scrolling, first-person, [[third-person shooter|third-person]], over-the-shoulder, or even a 3/4 isometric view.

Many action-adventure games simulate a conversation through a [[conversation tree]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} When the player encounters a [[non-player character]], they are allowed to select a choice of what to say. The NPC gives a scripted response to the player, and the game offers the player several new ways to respond.

Due to the action-adventure subgenre's broad inclusive nature it causes some players to having difficulty finishing a particular game. To compensate for this lack of the player's ability, companies have devised ways to give the player help, such as helpful clues, or allowing them to skip puzzles outright.<ref name=Puzzle3>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2917/designing_and_integrating_puzzles_.php?page=3|title=Designing and Integrating Puzzles in Action-Adventure Games|last=Luban|first=Pascal|page=3|work=Gamasutra|publisher=Think Services Game Group|date=2002-12-06|accessdate=2009-02-05}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Legend of Zelda NES.PNG|thumb|right|''[[The Legend of Zelda (1986 video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986), a seminal title that established the action-adventure game genre.]]
The history of the action-adventure genre began with the [[Text-based game|text-based]] ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' (1976), which was the first [[adventure game]] ever created. First written for the [[PDP-10]], it was later ported to countless other platforms. A programmer for [[Atari]], [[Warren Robinett]], was given the task of adapting ''Colossal Cave Adventure'' to the [[Atari 2600]]. With the new iteration, Atari planned to allow the player to fight in combat like in an [[action game]], thus leading to the first action-adventure game, ''[[Adventure (Atari 2600)|Adventure]]'' (1979).<ref name=justadventure/> It is considered the first known game in this genre.<ref>{{cite book|title=Video Game Theory Reader|editor1-last=Wolf|editor1-first=Mark J. P.|editor1-link=|editor2-last=Perron|editor2-first=Bernard|editor2-link=|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|location= |isbn=0-415-96578-0|page=x|chapter=Foreword|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PurLg5KfPioC&printsec=frontcover#PPR10,M1}}</ref> Later, [[Silas Warner]] arrived at [[Muse Software]], where he developed ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', an action-adventure game that would inspire [[id Software]] to create the [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games|first1=Rusel|last1=DeMaria|authorlink1=|first2=Johnny L.|last2=Wilson|authorlink2=|year=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location= |isbn=0-07-223172-6|page=224|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HJNvZLvpCEQC&printsec=frontcover#PPA224,M1}}</ref> According to Roe R. Adams (who worked on the ''[[Wizardry]]'' series of [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]]), early action-adventures "were basically [[arcade game]]s done in a [[fantasy]] setting," pointing to ''[[Castlevania]]'', ''[[Trojan (video game)|Trojan]]'' and ''[[Wizards & Warriors]]'' as examples.<ref>{{citation|first=Roe R.|last=Adams|work=[[Computer Gaming World]]|date=November 1990|issue=76|pages=83–84 [83]|title=Westward Ho! (Toward Japan, That Is): An Overview of the Evolution of CRPGs on Dedicated Game Machines|quote=Action adventures were basically arcade games done in a fantasy setting such as ''Castlevania'', ''Trojan'', and ''Wizards & Warriors''.}}</ref>

The action-adventure later became an established genre with [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]'s ''[[The Legend of Zelda (1986 video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986), which became a success due to how it combined elements from different genres to create a compelling hybrid, including exploration, [[transport puzzle]]s, adventure-style inventory [[Puzzle game|puzzles]], an action component, a [[monetary system]], and simplified RPG-style [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level building]] without the [[experience point]]s.<ref>{{cite web|author= Travis Fahs |url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/939/939361p1.html |title=IGN Presents the History of Zelda - Retro Feature at IGN |publisher=Uk.retro.ign.com |date=2010-08-27 |accessdate=2011-01-25}}</ref> The game was also an early example of [[open world]], [[nonlinear gameplay]], and introduced innovations like [[Saved game|saving]] on battery backup. It became one of the most influential games of the [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit era]], inspiring action-adventures like ''[[Metroid]]'' and RPGs like ''[[Final Fantasy]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=15 Most Influential Games of All Time: The Legend of Zelda|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p9_01.html|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> ''Zelda'' has since remained the most prolific action-adventure game series through to the present day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Most-prolific action-adventure video game series|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/6000/most-prolific-action-adventure-video-game-series|work=[[Guinness World Records]]|accessdate=17 April 2012|date=1 Jan 2007}}</ref> Games like ''[[Xanadu (video game)|Xanadu]]'', ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' and ''[[Vampire Killer]]'' combined action-adventure exploration with a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]] format, creating the [[Metroidvania]] platform-adventure subgenre. Similarly, games like ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'' and ''[[Metal Gear (video game)|Metal Gear]]'' combined action-adventure exploration with stealth mechanics, laying the foundations for the [[stealth game]] subgenre, which would later be popularized in 1998 by ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', ''[[Tenchu: Stealth Assassins]]'', and ''[[Thief: The Dark Project]]''.

The [[cinematic platformer]] ''[[Prince of Persia (1989 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' (1989) featured action-adventure elements, inspiring games such as ''[[Another World (video game)|Another World]]'' (1991) and ''[[Flashback (1992 video game)|Flashback]]'' (1992). ''[[Alone in the Dark (video game)|Alone in the Dark]]'' (1992) featured the use of [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]], which would later be popularized by ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'' (1996) and ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' (1996). ''[[Resident Evil]]'' in particular created the [[survival horror]] subgenre, inspiring titles such as ''[[Silent Hill (video game)|Silent Hill]]'' (1999) and ''[[Fatal Frame (video game)|Fatal Frame]]'' (2001).<ref name=justadventure/> Action-adventure games have gone on to become more popular than the pure [[adventure game]]s and pure [[Platform game|platform]] [[action game]]s that influenced them.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4074/the_designers_notebook_sorting_.php?page=2 | publisher = Gamasutra | author = Ernest Adams | date = 2009-07-09 | accessdate = 2009-05-23 | title = Sorting Out the Genre Muddle }}</ref>
