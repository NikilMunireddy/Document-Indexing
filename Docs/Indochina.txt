'''Indochina''', or the '''Indochinese Peninsula''' (also known as '''Mainland Southeast Asia'''), is a historical name that refers to the continental portion of [[Southeast Asia]]<ref name="HMDOG">{{cite book|title=The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary Of Geography|year=1997|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|isbn=0-395-86448-8|editor=Marion Severynse}}</ref> lying east of [[India]] and roughly south or southwest of [[China]]. The historical name "Indochina" has its origins in the French ''Indochine'', a combination of the names of "India" and "China", referring to the location of the territory between those two countries.

The countries of mainland Southeast Asia received cultural influence from both India and China to varying degrees.<ref name="HMDOG"/> Some cultures, such as those of Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Malaysia are influenced mainly by India with a smaller influence from China. Others, such as Vietnam, are more heavily influenced by Chinese culture with only minor cultural influences from India, largely via the [[Champa]] civilization that Vietnam conquered during its southward expansion.

The region experienced [[colonial rule]] through the 19th century into the mid-20th century with [[French Indochina]] as well as [[British Raj|British India]].
