==League business==

National Hockey League announced that the regular season salary cap rise after the initial season. The 2006–07 salary cap was increased by $5,000,000 (US) per team to bring the salary cap up to $44,000,000 (US). While the 2006–07 salary floor was increased by $8,000,000 (US) per team to $28,000,000 (US).  This is the only year where the NHL salary floor raised faster than the NHL salary cap.

The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim officially shortened their name to the [[Anaheim Ducks]] prior to the season, introducing a new logo and color scheme. This reflected a clean break from their original owners, [[The Walt Disney Company]], who originally named the team after the movie, ''[[The Mighty Ducks]]''.<ref>{{cite press release| url=http://www.anaheimducks.com/press/release/article.php?dir=200601&id=1202 | title=Mighty Ducks of Anaheim to Change Name to Anaheim Ducks in 2006–2007| accessdate=June 15, 2007 <!--DASHBot-->}}  {{Wayback|url=http://www.anaheimducks.com/press/release/article.php?dir=200601&id=1202|date =20070311042913 }}</ref>

==Regular season==
The [[NHL All-Star Game]] returned after a two-year absence when the [[Dallas Stars]] hosted the [[55th National Hockey League All-Star Game]] at the [[American Airlines Center]] on January 24, 2007. Dallas hosted the All-Star Game for the first time, and it was the first time the Stars franchise had hosted the game since 1972, when it was hosted by the-then [[Minnesota North Stars]].  The [[Western Conference (NHL)|West]] defeated the [[Eastern Conference (NHL)|East]] by a score of 12–9, with [[Danny Brière|Danny Briere]] of the [[Buffalo Sabres]] being named MVP of the game. Fewer penalties were called than in 2005–06 (an average of 398 per team).<ref>[http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2007.html 2006–07 NHL Season Summary &#124; Hockey-Reference.com] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wg3FoHnK|date =February 21, 2011| accessdate=February 22, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> This led to fewer goals scored overall (7,082)<ref name="hockey-reference.com">[http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2007_skaters.html 2006–07 NHL Season Skater Statistics &#124; Hockey-Reference.com] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wg3Gbye6|date =February 21, 2011| accessdate=February 22, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> and more shutouts (150).<ref>[http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2007_goalies.html 2006–07 NHL Season Goalie Statistics &#124; Hockey-Reference.com] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wg3HWX6e|date =February 21, 2011| accessdate=February 22, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref> However, more even-strength goals were scored (4,715)<ref name="hockey-reference.com"/> than in 2005–06 (4,579).<ref>[http://www.hockey-reference.com/leagues/NHL_2006_skaters.html 2005–06 NHL Season Skater Statistics &#124; Hockey-Reference.com] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wg3IFhRI|date =February 21, 2011| accessdate=February 22, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

This season would have an intense battle between [[Martin Brodeur]] and [[Roberto Luongo]] for the [[Vezina Trophy]] and a piece of NHL history. Both goaltenders were vying to break [[Bernie Parent]]'s NHL record 47 wins in a single season. On April 3, 2007, Brodeur tied the NHL record for most wins in a single season with 47, set by Parent in [[1973–74 NHL season|1973–74]], in a 2–1 shootout victory against the Ottawa Senators.<ref name="Standings0226">{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nhl/standings;_ylt=Ah6GJ3htsMPCh5StqCrl7Ih7vLYF|title=2006–07 NHL Standings|publisher=Yahoo! Sports|accessdate=April 4, 2007|year=2007}}</ref> Two days later, he broke the thirty-three-year-old record with his 48th win in a 3–2 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers, which helped the Devils clinch their seventh Atlantic Division title and the second seed in the Eastern Conference. Luongo finished with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of Brodeur, and consequently finished runner-up in a close race for the Vezina. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the shootout that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties.<ref>{{vcite news |title=Canucks' Luongo aims for exclusive club |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2007/03/11/nhl-van-ana-preview.html |accessdate=February 1, 2010 |date=March 11, 2007 |work=[[CBC Sports]] }} {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wg3Jcbvi|date =February 21, 2011| accessdate=February 22, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->}}</ref>

In each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference is matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team is awarded home ice advantage, which gives them a maximum possible four games on their home ice, with the other team getting a maximum possible three. In the Stanley Cup Final, home ice is determined based on regular season points, giving the Anaheim Ducks home ice for this year's series. Each best-of-seven series follows a 2–2–1–1–1 format. This means that the higher-seeded team will have Games 1 and 2, plus 5 and 7 if necessary, played on their home ice, while the lower-seeded team will be at home for the other games. The format ensures that the team with home ice advantage will always have home ice for the "extra" game if there are an odd number of games in a series.
