The '''American Athletic Conference''' (also known as '''The American''') is an American [[List of NCAA conferences|collegiate athletic conference]], featuring 11 member universities and four associate member universities that compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s (NCAA) [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], with its [[College football|football]] teams competing in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS). Member universities represent a range of private and public universities of various enrollment sizes located primarily in [[Urban area|urban]] [[metropolitan areas]] in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]], [[Western United States|Western]], and [[Southern United States|Southern]] regions of the [[United States]].<ref name="aac">{{cite web|url=http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/243706/new-name-in-college-sports-current-big-east-enters-new-era-as-american-athletic.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421031242/http://www.bigeast.org/News/tabid/435/Article/243706/new-name-in-college-sports-current-big-east-enters-new-era-as-american-athletic.aspx|archivedate=2013-04-21|title=New Name in College Sports - Current BIG EAST Enters New Era as 'American Athletic Conference' |date=2013-04-03|accessdate=2013-04-03}}</ref><ref name="oldbe">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/blog/_/name/katz_andy/id/9057093/the-steps-new-big-east-conference-college-basketball |title=What's next for the 'old Big East' |last=Katz |first=Andy |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2013-03-15 |accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref>

The league is the product of substantial turmoil in the [[Big East Conference (1979–2013)|original Big East Conference]] during the [[2010–13 NCAA conference realignment|2010–14 conference realignment period]]. It is one of two conferences to emerge from the all-sports Big East in 2013. While the other successor, which does not sponsor football, purchased the [[Big East Conference]] name, The American inherited the old Big East's structure and is that conference's legal successor. However, both conferences claim 1979 as their founding date, and the same history up to 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theamerican.org/sports/2013/6/22/ABOUT_0622134018.aspx |title=About the American Athletic Conference |publisher=American Athletic Conference |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigeast.com/sports/2015/6/10/History.aspx |title=(New) Big East Conference history |publisher=[[Big East Conference]] |accessdate=2014-06-23}}</ref> The American is headquartered in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and led by Commissioner [[Michael Aresco]].<ref name="oldbe"/><ref name="aresco">{{cite news|url=http://www.delmarvanow.com/viewart/20130309/SPORTS/303090035/Big-East-completes-official-split-football-basketball|title=Big East completes official split of football, basketball|last=Russo|first=Ralph|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2013-03-08|accessdate=2013-03-17}}</ref>

==History==

===The original Big East===
{{main|Big East Conference (1979–2013)}}
The original Big East Conference was founded in 1979 as a basketball conference and included the colleges of [[Providence Friars|Providence]], [[St. John's Red Storm|St. John's]], [[Georgetown Hoyas|Georgetown]], and [[Syracuse Orange|Syracuse]], which in turn invited [[Connecticut Huskies|Connecticut]] (UConn), [[Holy Cross Crusaders|Holy Cross]], [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights|Rutgers]], and [[Boston College Eagles|Boston College]] to be members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ajerseyguy.com/?p=5625 |title=Naming original Big East was simple |last=Blaudschun |first=Mark |publisher=AJerseyGuy.com |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref><ref name=Crouthamel>{{cite web|url=http://www.suathletics.com/sports/2001/8/8/history.aspx|title=A Big East History and Retrospective, Part 1|last=Crouthamel|first=Jake|date=2000-12-08 |publisher=SUAthletics.com |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref> UConn and Boston College would accept the invitation, while Holy Cross soon thereafter declined the invitation, and Rutgers eventually declined and remained in the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] (then known as the Eastern 8 Conference). [[Seton Hall Pirates|Seton Hall]] was then invited as a replacement, and the conference started play with seven members.<ref name=Crouthamel/>

[[Villanova Wildcats|Villanova]] and [[Pittsburgh Panthers|Pittsburgh]] joined shortly thereafter under the leadership of the Big East's first commissioner, [[Dave Gavitt]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/sports/ncaabasketball/dave-gavitt-the-big-easts-founder-dies-at-73.html?_r=1&adxnnl=1&ref=deathsobituaries&adxnnlx=1316347225-meOtGfclrJRPis3Xx35n4w#&wtoeid=growl1_r1_v5|title=Dave Gavitt, the Big East's Founder, Dies at 73|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2011-09-17|accessdate=2013-03-09|author=Sarah Maslin Nir}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Big East, Villanova Make It Official |agency=United Press International |newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]] |date=1980-03-13 |accessdate=2013-03-09 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xBshAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SFwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4471,6402629&dq=big-east-conference+villanova&hl=en }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Pittsburgh To Join Big East |first= Richard F |last=Hanley |date=1981-11-19 |accessdate=2013-03-09 |newspaper=[[Record-Journal]] |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=schHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u_8MAAAAIBAJ&pg=4292,2306993&dq=big-east-conference+football&hl=en}}</ref>

The conference remained largely unchanged until 1991, when it began to sponsor football, adding [[Miami Hurricanes|Miami]] as a full member, and Rutgers, [[Temple Owls|Temple]], [[Virginia Tech Hokies|Virginia Tech]], and [[West Virginia Mountaineers|West Virginia]] as football-only members.<ref>{{cite web|title=Big East Football Timeline |newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |date=2008-03-08 |url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-03-08/sports/31136038_1_big-east-football-football-only-member-football-schools |accessdate=2013-03-09 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AEtk8rbY|archivedate=2012-08-27}}</ref> Rutgers and West Virginia upgraded to full Big East membership in 1995, while Virginia Tech did the same in 2000. Temple football was kicked out after the 2004 season, but rejoined in 2012 and intended to become a full Big East member in 2013.

The unusual structure of the Big East, with the "football" and "non-football" schools, led to instability in the conference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/08/sports/ncaabasketball/john-marinatto-resigns-as-big-east-commissioner.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|title=Commissioner John Marinatto Steps Down Amid Big East's Instability|last=Thamel|first=Pete|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2012-05-07|accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref> The waves of defection and replacement brought about by the conference realignments of [[2005 NCAA conference realignment|2005]] and [[2010–13 NCAA conference realignment|2010–13]] revealed tension between the football-sponsoring and non-football schools that eventually led to the split of the conference in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8801033/big-east-was-unwilling-meet-boise-state-terms-according-mike-aresco |title=Big East 'unwilling' to meet terms |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2013-01-03 |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref>

{{Further|2010–13 NCAA conference realignment|2010–13 Big East Conference realignment}}
The conference was reorganized following the tumultuous period of realignment that hobbled the Big East between 2010 and 2013. The Big East was one of the most severely impacted conferences during the most recent conference realignment period. In all, 14 member schools announced their departure for other conferences, and 15 other schools announced plans to join the conference (eight as all-sports members, and four for football only). Three of the latter group later backed out of their plans to join (one for all sports, and the other two for football only).

On December 15, 2012, the Big East's seven remaining non-FBS schools, all [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]] institutions – [[DePaul University|DePaul]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], [[Marquette University|Marquette]], [[Providence College|Providence]], [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's]], [[Seton Hall University|Seton Hall]], and [[Villanova University|Villanova]] – announced that they voted unanimously to leave the Big East Conference, effective June 30, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8735330/big-east-direction-concerns-conference-catholic-schools-sources-say |title=Big East fate vexes Catholic schools |first1=Andy |last1=Katz |first2=Brett |last2=McMurphy |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2012-12-11 |accessdate=2012-12-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/8749700/seven-schools-decide-leave-big-east-pursue-new-basketball-framework|title=Seven schools leaving Big East |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2012-12-15 | accessdate=December 15, 2012}}</ref> The "Catholic 7", by leaving, were looking for a more lucrative television deal than the one they would receive by remaining with the football schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/8817624/fleeing-big-east-schools-working-lucrative-tv-deal-basketball|title=Sources: 'Catholic 7' eyes big TV deal |last=Rovell |first=Darren |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=2013-01-06 |accessdate=2013-03-06}}</ref> In March 2013, representatives of the Catholic 7 announced they would leave the conference effective June 30, 2013, retaining the Big East name, $10 million, and the right to hold the [[Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|conference's basketball tournament]] at [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref name="bcsname"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegebasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/03/05/catholic-7-has-framework-to-keep-big-east-name-msg-as-tourney-site/|title=Catholic 7 has framework to keep Big East name, MSG as tourney site|last=Harten|first=David|publisher=[[NBC Sports]] |date=2013-03-05|accessdate=2013-03-07}}</ref>

The conference previously did not have enough teams to form divisions, but now does after [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]] joined the conference in 2015.<ref group="note">The NCAA currently requires 12 teams for a conference to conduct divisional play and stage a championship game.</ref> When Navy joined in 2015 and divisions were created, Navy was placed in the West division along with Houston, Memphis, SMU, Tulane, and Tulsa. Teams play eight conference games a season. Beginning in 2015, each team will face the other five teams in its own division, as well as three teams from the other division, operating in a four-year cycle ensuring that each school will play every conference opponent at home and on the road at least once in the four-year cycle.<ref>{{cite news|title=American Announces Football Schedule Format for 2015-18|url=http://theamerican.org/news/2014/12/18/FB_1218143422.aspx|newspaper=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2014-12-18|date=2012-12-18}}</ref> The East and West division winners, determined by final conference record, will meet in the first American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game, which will be played at the home site of one of the division winners.

Like the conference itself, football experienced much transition through its history – in fact it was the main force behind such departures and expansion. In 2003, the BCS announced that it would adjust the automatic bids granted to its six founding conferences based on results from 2004 to 2007. With the addition of [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]], [[Louisville Cardinals|Louisville]], and [[South Florida Bulls|South Florida]] in 2005, the conference retained its BCS automatic-qualifying status. In 2007, South Florida rose to No. 2 in the BCS rankings, but finished No. 21 in the final poll. Cincinnati finished the 2009 regular season undefeated at 12–0, and ranked No. 3 in the final BCS standings, barely missing the opportunity to play for the BCS National Championship. The conference was 9–7 (.563) in [[BCS Bowl#Bowl games|BCS bowl games]], the third highest winning percentage amongst the AQ conferences.

===Conference champions===
{{main|American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game}}
{{Details3|[[Big East Conference (1979–2013)#Champions|this list]]|football champions of the Big East Conference from 1991 to 2012}}
The American Championship Game pits the Eastern Division representative against the Western Division representative in a game held following the conclusion of the regular season. The site of the Championship Game is the home stadium of the division champion with the best overall conference record. In the event that the two division champions are tied, then the head-to-head record shall be used as the tiebreaker. Prior to the 2015 season, when the conference split into two six-team divisions and created a conference championship game, The American awarded its championship to the team(s) with the best overall conference record.

===Rivalries===
The American has many rivalries among its member schools, primarily in [[American football|football]]. Some rivalries existed before the conference was established or began play in football. Recent conference realignment in 2005 and 2013 ended – or temporarily halted – many rivalries. Before their departure to other conferences, a number of former member schools held longtime rivalries within the conference.

===Bowl games===
Following the 2013 season, the BCS era came to a close and was replaced by the [[College Football Playoff]]. Four teams will play in two semifinal games, with the winners advancing to the new [[College Football Championship Game]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/04/24/college-football-playoff-questions-and-answers/2111419/|title=Questions and answers for the College Football Playoff|last=Wolken |first=Dan |date=April 25, 2013 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=April 25, 2013}}</ref> Six bowl games — the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], [[Sugar Bowl]], [[Orange Bowl]], [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]], [[Fiesta Bowl]], and [[Peach Bowl]] — will rotate as hosts for the semifinal games, and host major bowls when they do not host semifinal games (access bowls).

With the birth of the College Football Playoff, The American lost its automatic qualifying status for one of the major bowls. Instead, one automatic qualifying spot is reserved for the highest ranked team from the "Group of Five" conferences - The American, Conference USA, the Mid-American Conference, Mountain West Conference, and Sun Belt Conference.

Although the pick order usually corresponds to the conference standings, the bowls are not required to make their choices strictly according to the won-lost records; many factors influence bowl selections, especially the likely turnout of the team's fans. Picks are made after any applicable College Football Playoff selections. If a team is selected for the one of the access bowls or playoff, the bowl with the No. 2 pick will have the first pick of the remaining teams in the conference.
