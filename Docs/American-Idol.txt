'''''American Idol''''' is<!--Do not change "is" to "was" per Wikipedia guidelines.--> an American singing competition television series created by [[Simon Fuller]], produced by [[19 Entertainment]], and distributed by [[FremantleMedia North America]]. It began airing on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on June 11, 2002, and ended on April 7, 2016. It started off as an addition to the [[Idols (TV series)|''Idols'' format]] based on the British series ''[[Pop Idol]]'', and became one of the most successful shows in the history of [[Television in the United States|American television]]. The concept of the series involves discovering recording stars from unsigned singing talents, with the winner determined by the viewers in America through telephones, Internet, and [[Short message service|SMS text]] voting.  Winners chosen by viewers in its fifteen seasons were [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Ruben Studdard]], [[Fantasia Barrino]], [[Carrie Underwood]], [[Taylor Hicks]], [[Jordin Sparks]], [[David Cook (singer)|David Cook]], [[Kris Allen]], [[Lee DeWyze]], [[Scotty McCreery]], [[Phillip Phillips]], [[Candice Glover]],  [[Caleb Johnson (singer)|Caleb Johnson]], [[Nick Fradiani]], and [[Trent Harmon]].

''American Idol'' employed a panel of judges who critique the contestants' performances. The original judges were record producer and music manager [[Randy Jackson]], pop singer and choreographer [[Paula Abdul]] and music executive and manager [[Simon Cowell]]. The judging panel for the final seasons consisted of country singer [[Keith Urban]], singer and actress [[Jennifer Lopez]], and jazz singer [[Harry Connick, Jr.]]<ref name=J-Lo&Connick>[http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/09/03/american-idol-jennifer-lopez-harry-connick-jr/ Official: J.

The success of ''American Idol'' has been described as "unparalleled in broadcasting history".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tqt_nxRY7xIC&pg=PA106#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Global Media Ecologies: Networked Production in Film and Television |author= Doris Baltruschat |page= 106 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2010 |isbn=978-0415874786 }}</ref> The series was also said by a rival TV executive to be "the most impactful show in the history of television".<ref name="carter">{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/arts/television/20idol.html |title=For Fox's Rivals, 'American Idol' Remains a 'Schoolyard Bully' |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 13, 2008 |first=Bill |last=Carter |date=February 20, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080425002642/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/20/arts/television/20idol.html| archivedate= April 25, 2008 | deadurl= no}}</ref> It became a recognized springboard for launching the career of many artists as bona fide stars.

==History==
''American Idol'' was based on the British show ''[[Pop Idol]]'' created by [[Simon Fuller]], which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition ''[[Popstars]]''. Television producer [[Nigel Lythgoe]] saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain.<ref name=guardin>{{Cite news|author=Stephen Armstrong |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jan/11/nigel-lythgoe-television-dance |title=Nice work for Nasty Nigel Lythgoe |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= January 11, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Fuller was inspired by the idea from ''Popstars'' of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, such as [[Televoting|telephone voting]] by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows such as the ''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]''), the drama of backstories and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time.<ref name=variety>{{cite news|last=Fuller |first=Simon |url=http://variety.com/2011/tv/news/simon-fuller-on-how-idol-began-2-1118037190/4|title=Simon Fuller on how 'Idol' began |work=Variety |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref> The show debuted in 2001 in Britain with Lythgoe as showrunner{{nsmdns}}the executive producer and production leader{{nsmdns}}and [[Simon Cowell]] as one of the judges, and was a big success with the viewing public.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1787135.stm |title=Pop Idol audience reaches 10&nbsp;million |publisher=BBC News |date=January 28, 2002 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

In 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the ''Pop Idol'' format to the United States, but the idea was met with poor response from United States television networks.<ref name="NYT - American Idol"/> However, [[Rupert Murdoch]], head of [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]'s [[News Corporation|parent company]], was persuaded to buy the show by his daughter [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth]], who was a fan of the British show.<ref name="NYT - American Idol">{{Cite news| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/business/yourmoney/30idol.html| title = How a Hit Almost Failed Its Own Audition|work=The New York Times| date = April 30, 2006| author=Bill Carter
}}</ref> The show was renamed ''American Idol: The Search for a Superstar'' and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job as showrunner but refused; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to Cowell's surprise, it became one of the hit shows for the summer that year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/1957221.stm |work=BBC News | title=US starts Pop Idol search | date=April 29, 2002}}</ref><ref name="Watching TV: six decades of American television">[https://books.google.com/books?id=A16TTK0vN7sC&pg=PA420&lpg=PA420&dq=go+pound+sand+2003+kelly+clarkson&source=bl&ots=QnSUOWsUOH&sig=UlXJzN4a-12SF33XzxoAK88l1jA&hl=en&ei=oi6GTJnjJ9m5jAe4wpClBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=go%20pound%20sand%202003%20kelly%20clarkson&f=false Watching TV: six decades of American television] By Harry Castleman, Walter J.

===Judges===
The show had originally planned on having four judges following the ''Pop Idol'' format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell.<ref name="NYT - American Idol"/> A fourth judge, radio DJ [[Stryker (disc jockey)|Stryker]], was originally chosen but he dropped out citing "image concerns".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/416531/stryker-strikes-out-the-man-who-was-supposed-to-be-the-fourth-idol-judge/ |title=Stryker Strikes Out: The Man Who Was Supposed To Be The Fourth 'Idol' Judge |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |date=January 12, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> In the second season, New York radio personality [[Angie Martinez]] had been hired as a fourth judge but withdrew only after a few days of auditions due to not being comfortable with giving out criticism.<ref>{{cite news|last=Susman |first=Gary |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,386158,00.html |title=Sitting 'Idol' &#124; TV |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 31, 2002 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> The show decided to continue with the three judges format until season eight. All three original judges stayed on the judging panel for eight seasons.

In season eight, [[Latin Grammy Award]]-nominated singer–songwriter and record producer [[Kara DioGuardi]] was added as a fourth judge. She stayed for two seasons and left the show before season ten.<ref>{{cite web|last=Slezak |first=Michael |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/09/03/kara-dioguardi-not-returning-to-american-idol-its-finally-official/ |title=Sep 3 Kara DioGuardi not returning to 'American Idol': It's (finally) official |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=September 3, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Paula Abdul left the show before season nine after failing to agree terms with the show producers.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118006911.html?categoryId=2848&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Abdul ends her 'Idol' era | first=Jon | last=Weisman | date=August 4, 2009}}</ref> [[Emmy Award]]-winning talk show host [[Ellen DeGeneres]] replaced Paula Abdul for that season, but left after just one season.<ref name="degeneresidol">{{Cite news | title = Ellen DeGeneres is out as 'American Idol' judge |work=Los Angeles Times | date = July 30, 2010 | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-ellen-degeneres-american-idol,0,28082.story | accessdate =July 30, 2010 | first=Scott | last=Collins| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100801024529/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-ellen-degeneres-american-idol,0,28082.story| archivedate= August 1, 2010 | deadurl= no}}</ref> On January 11, 2010, Simon Cowell announced that he was leaving the show to pursue introducing the [[The X Factor (U.S.)|American version]] of his show ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' to the USA for 2011.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8453267.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Simon Cowell to leave American Idol | date=January 12, 2010 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}}</ref> [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Steven Tyler]] joined the judging panel in season ten,<ref name="newjudges"/> but both left after two seasons.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/steven-tylers-idol-departure-influenced-jennifer-lopezs-own-exit-20120717

===Hosts===
The first season was co-hosted by [[Ryan Seacrest]] and [[Brian Dunkleman]] following the format of ''Pop Idol'' of using two presenters. Dunkleman quit thereafter,<ref>{{cite web|last=Potts|first=Kim|title='American Idol: The Untold Story' Book Author Richard Rushfield Talks Past 'Idol' Scandals, Backstage Divas and Season 10|url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2011/01/18/american-idol-the-untold-story-book-author-richard-rushfield/?icid=maing{{!}}main5%7cdl2%7csec1_lnk5%7c37044 |publisher=TV Squad|accessdate=January 18, 2010}}</ref> making Seacrest the sole [[emcee]] of the show starting with season two. Dunkleman did, however, return in the series finale.

===In-house mentors===
Beginning in the tenth season{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}, permanent mentors were brought in during the live shows to help guide the contestants with their song choice and performance. [[Jimmy Iovine]] was the mentor in the tenth through twelfth seasons, former judge [[Randy Jackson]] was the mentor for the thirteenth season and [[Scott Borchetta]] was the mentor for the fourteenth and fifteenth season. The mentors regularly bring in guest mentors to aid them, including [[Akon]], [[Alicia Keys]], [[Lady Gaga]], and current judge [[Harry Connick, Jr.]].

==Selection process==
In a series of steps, the show selected the eventual winner out of many tens of thousands of contestants.

===Contestant eligibility===
The eligible age-range for contestants was fifteen to twenty-eight years old. The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons, but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in season four, and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in season ten. The contestants had to be legal U.S. residents, could not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons, and must not have held a current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.americanidol.com/auditions/season_10/forms/ai10_auditions_rules.pdf |title=American Idol 10 Audition Rules |format=PDF |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> (in previous years by the audition stage).<ref name="season 4 rules"/>
{{wide image|American Idol Denver auditions panorama.jpg|700px|Season nine's Denver audition, at [[Sports Authority Field at Mile High|Invesco Field at Mile High]].}}

===Initial auditions===
Contestants went through at least three sets of cuts. The first was a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these made it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sang in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-01-19/secret-rituals-of-american-idol-auditions-exposed/ |title=Secret Rituals of ''American Idol'' Auditions Exposed |publisher=Thedailybeast.com |date=January 19, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10–60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

===Hollywood week and Las Vegas round===
Once in Hollywood, the contestants performed individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until season ten, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood. In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and performed a song together. In the final round, the contestants performed solo with a song of their choice [[a cappella]] or accompanied by a band{{nsmdns}}depending on the season. In seasons two and three, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In season seven, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round. In season twelve, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.

In seasons ten and eleven, a further round was added in Las Vegas, where the contestants performed in groups based on a theme, followed by one final solo round to determine the semi-finalists. At the end of this stage of the competition, 24 to 36 contestants were selected to move on to the semi-final stage. In season twelve the Las Vegas round became a Sudden Death round, where the judges had to choose five guys and five girls each night (four nights) to make the top twenty. In season thirteen, a new round called "Hollywood or Home" was added, where if the judges were uncertain about some contestants, those contestants were required to perform soon after landing in Los Angeles, and those who failed to impress were sent back home before they reached Hollywood.

===Audience voting===
From the semi-finals onward, the fate of the contestants was decided by public vote. During the contestant's performance as well as the recap at the end, a [[toll-free telephone number]] for each contestant was displayed on the screen. For a two-hour period after the episode ends (up to four hours for the finale) in each US time zone, viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant's telephone number, and each call or text message was registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers were allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window. However, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanidol.com/faq/ |title=American Idol FAQS |publisher=Americanidol.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110222034734/http://www.americanidol.com/faq/| archivedate= February 22, 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref> One or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges.

In the first three seasons, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In season one, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In seasons two and three, there were four groups of eight, and the top two of each selected. These seasons also featured a wildcard round, where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In season one, only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges, giving a total of ten finalists. In seasons two and three, each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals, making 12 finalists in all.

From seasons four to seven and nine, the twenty-four semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top twelve. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve.

The wildcard round returned in season eight, wherein there were three groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward – the highest male, the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer - for each night, and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13. Starting season ten, the girls and boys perform on separate nights. In seasons ten and eleven, five of each gender were chosen, and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13. In season twelve, the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups, with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10. In season thirteen, there were thirty semifinalists, but only twenty semifinalists (ten for each gender) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows, with five in each gender and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13.

===Finals===
The finals were broadcast in prime time from [[CBS Television City]] in Los Angeles, in front of a live studio audience. The finals lasted eight weeks in season one, eleven weeks in subsequent seasons until seasons ten and eleven which lasted twelve weeks except for season twelve, which lasted ten weeks, and season thirteen, which lasted for thirteen weeks. Each finalist performed songs based on a weekly theme which may be a musical genre such as [[Motown]], [[disco]], or [[big band]], songs by artists such as [[Michael Jackson]], [[Elvis Presley]] or [[The Beatles]], or more general themes such as ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Number 1 hits or songs from the contestant's year of birth. Contestants usually work with a celebrity mentor related to the theme. In season ten, Jimmy Iovine was brought in as a mentor for the season. Initially the contestants sang one song each week, but this is increased to two songs from top four or five onwards, then three songs for the top two or three.

The most popular contestants were usually not revealed in the results show.  Instead, typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes was called to the center of the stage. One of these three was usually sent to safety; however the two remaining were not necessarily the bottom two.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/05012009/tv/adam_really_was_in_the_bottom_3_167038.htm |title=Adam Really Was in the Bottom 3 |author=Maxine Shen |work=New York Post |date=May 1, 2009}}</ref> The contestant with the fewest votes was then revealed and eliminated from the competition. A montage of the eliminated contestant's time on the show was played and they gave their final performance. However, in [[American Idol (season 6)|season six]], during the series' first ever [[Idol Gives Back]] episode, no contestant was eliminated, but on the following week, two were sent home. Moreover, starting in [[American Idol (season 8)|season eight]], the judges may overturn viewers' decision with a "Judges' Save" if they unanimously agreed to. "The save" could only be used once, and only up through the top five. In the eighth, ninth, tenth, and fourteenth seasons, a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save, but in the eleventh  and thirteenth seasons, a regular single elimination took place. The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently, a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week.

The "Fan Save" was introduced in the fourteenth season. During the finals, viewers were given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 8.

===Season finale===
The finale was the two-hour last episode of the season, culminating in revealing the winner. For seasons one, three through six, fourteen, and fifteen it was broadcast from the [[Dolby Theatre]], which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The finale for season two took place at the [[Gibson Amphitheatre]], which has an audience capacity of over 6,000. In seasons seven through thirteen, the venue was at the [[Microsoft Theater|Nokia Theatre]], which holds an audience of over 7,000.

===Rewards for winner and finalists===
The winner received a record deal with a major label, which may be for up to six albums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/05/12/american-idol-contract-sex-judges-simon-cowell/ |title='Idol' Contestants – No Shtupping the Judges |publisher=Tmz.com |date=May 13, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref><ref name="NYT 02-24-2010">{{Cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/arts/television/24idol.html |title=Idol' Winners: Not Just Fame but Big Bucks |work=The New York Times |last=Wyatt |first=Edward |date=February 23, 2010}}</ref> and secures a management contract with ''American Idol''-affiliated [[19 Management]] (which has the [[right of first refusal]] to sign all contestants), as well as various lucrative contracts.

Prominent music mogul [[Clive Davis]] also produced some of the selected contestants' albums, such as Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. All top 10 (11 in seasons 10 and 12) finalists earn the privilege of going on a tour, where the participants may each earn a six-figure sum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bankrate.com/finance/personal-finance/the-cost-of-being-on-american-idol-6.aspx |title=The cost of being on 'American Idol' |publisher=Bankrate.com |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref>

==Series overview and season synopses==
{{Main|List of American Idol episodes}}
Each season premiered with the audition round, taking place in different cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists, interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant received a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round for seasons 10 onward), 24 to 36 contestants were selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals. From the semifinals onward the contestants performed their songs live, with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants were voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes was then revealed in the results show typically on the following night. The results shows featured group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The Top-three results show also featured the homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists. The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show, where the winner of the season was revealed.

With the exception of seasons one and two, the contestants in the semifinals onwards performed in front of a studio audience. They performed with a full band in the finals. From season four to season nine, the ''American Idol'' band was led by [[Rickey Minor]]; from season ten onwards, [[Ray Chew]]. Assistance may also have be given by vocal coaches and song arrangers, such as Michael Orland and [[Debra Byrd]] to contestants behind the scene. Starting with season seven, contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onwards. In the first nine seasons, performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights, followed by the results shows on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada, but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays in season ten.

===Season 1===
{{Main|American Idol (season 1)}}
[[File:Kelly Clarkson 57th Presidential Inauguration-cropped.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Kelly Clarkson]], [[American Idol (season 1)|season one]] winner]]
The first season of ''American Idol'' debuted as a summer replacement show in June 2002 on the Fox network. It was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman.

In the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show's age limit. One of the early favorites, [[Tamyra Gray]], was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popdirt.com/christina-christian-voted-off-american-idol-while-hospitalized/6496/ |title=Christina Christian Voted Off ‘American Idol’ While Hospitalized |publisher=Popdirt.com |date=August 8, 2002 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> [[Jim Verraros]] was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed in his online journal, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SWUEAAAAMBAJ&q=teen%20idol's%20#v=onepage&q=teen%20idol's&f=false |title=Teen Idol's Dream |publisher=The Advocate |date=January 21, 2003 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

The final showdown was between [[Justin Guarini]], one of the early favorites, and [[Kelly Clarkson]]. Clarkson was not initially thought of as a contender,<ref>{{cite web|last=Parker |first=Lyndsey |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/417463/fun-with-facts-things-you-didnt-know-about-american-idol-but-were-too-glued-to-your-tv-set-to-ask/ |title=Fun With Facts: Things You Didn't Know About 'American Idol' But Were Too Glued To Your TV Set To Ask |publisher=Yahoo Music Blogs: Reality Rocks |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref> but impressed the judges with some good performances in the final rounds, such as her performance of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s "[[(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman|Natural Woman]]", and [[Betty Hutton]]'s "[[Stuff Like That There]]", and eventually won the crown on September 4, 2002.

In what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, "[[A Moment Like This]]", went on to break a 38-year-old record held by [[The Beatles]] for the biggest leap to number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, ''[[From Justin to Kelly]]'', which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become the most successful ''Idol'' contestant internationally,<ref name="bronson 100"/> with worldwide album sales of more than 23&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/b/2009/12/04/carrie-underwood-moves-past-kelly-clarkson-in-top-us-album-sales-by-an-american-idol-artist.htm |title=Carrie Underwood Moves Past Kelly Clarkson In Top US Album Sales By An ''American Idol'' Artist |publisher=Top40.about.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

Starting September 30, 2006, this season was repackaged as "''[[American Idol Rewind]]''" and syndicated directly to stations in the U.S.

===Season 2===

[[File:Ruben Studdar 2 cropped.JPG|right|thumb|upright|[[Ruben Studdard]], [[American Idol (season 2)|season two]] winner]]
Following the success of season one, the second season was moved up to air in January 2003. The number of episodes increased, as did the show's budget and the charge for commercial spots. Dunkleman left the show, leaving Seacrest as the lone host. [[Kristin Adams]] was a correspondent for this season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://telepixtvcgi.warnerbros.com/dailynews/extra/11_02/11_20b.html |title='American Idol' |author=EXTRA |date=November 20, 2002}}</ref>

[[Corey Clark]] was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record; however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8931265/ |title=After probe, Paula Abdul to remain on 'Idol' |agency=Associated Press |date=August 24, 2005 | work=[[Today (NBC program)|Today]] }}</ref> Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year – Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and [[Frenchie Davis]] for having previously modelled for an adult website.<ref name="mtv - screening">{{cite web|last=Moss |first=Corey |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1484799/20040203/story.jhtml |title='American Idol' Steps Up Screening Process For Contestants |publisher=Mtv |date=February 4, 2004 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

[[Ruben Studdard]] emerged as the winner, beating [[Clay Aiken]] by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through.<ref name="Your Vote Doesn't Count">{{cite web |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/153439-American_Idol_Outrage_Your_Vote_Doesn_t_Count.php |title=''American Idol'' Outrage: Your Vote Doesn't Count |author=Deborah Starr Seibel |date=May 17, 2004}}</ref> In an interview prior to season five, executive producer [[Nigel Lythgoe]] indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realitynewsonline.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article9455.art&page=6 |title="It's Going to be a Very Strong Season, I Think": An Interview with American Idol Producer Nigel Lythgoe |author=Logan Martin |date=January 17, 2006}}</ref>

Both finalists found success after the show, but Aiken out-performed Studdard's coronation song "[[Flying Without Wings#Ruben Studdard version|Flying Without Wings]]" with his single release from the show "[[This Is the Night (Clay Aiken song)|This Is the Night]]", as well as in their subsequent album releases.

Season three premiered on January 19, 2004. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was [[William Hung]] whose off-key rendition of [[Ricky Martin]]'s "[[She Bangs]]" received widespread attention. His exposure on ''Idol'' landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the [[American Idol alumni album sales|third best-selling]] singer from that season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Top 24 American Idols of All Time |work=Billboard | url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/reality-check/513688/top-24-american-idols-of-all-time | accessdate = May 16, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112110915/http://www.billboard.com/features/top-24-american-idols-of-all-time-1004088662.story#/web/20101112110915/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/reality-check/513688/top-24-american-idols-of-all-time |archivedate=November 12, 2010  }}</ref>

Much media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, [[Fantasia Barrino]], [[LaToya London]], and [[Jennifer Hudson]], dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Hudson controversially eliminated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/buzz-over-jennifer-hudson-ouster-from-american-idol-3-continues-2518.php |title=Buzz over Jennifer Hudson's ouster from 'American Idol 3' continues |publisher=Realitytvworld.com |date=April 26, 2004 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes "incredibly racist".<ref>{{Wayback |date=20040429072819 |url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/040427/11/oqwi.html |title=Elton John Says 'American Idol' Vote Is 'Racist' }}, ''[[Reuters]] via Yahoo.com'', 2004-04-28, Retrieved on March 2, 2007.</ref> The prolonged stays of [[John Stevens (singer)|John Stevens]] and [[Jasmine Trias]] in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke 'blown out of proportion'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxesonidol.com/cgi-bin/ae.pl?mode=1&article=article1536.art&page=1 |title="Simon Kept Me in My Place": An Interview with John Stevens |publisher=Foxesonidol.com |date=April 30, 2004 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

The performance of "[[Summertime (song)|Summertime]]" by Barrino, later known simply as "Fantasia", at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite ''Idol'' moment in the nine seasons he was on the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2010/05/simon_cowells_favorite_idol_moment.php |title=Simon Cowell's Favorite 'Idol' Moment |publisher=Extratv.warnerbros.com |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Fantasia and [[Diana DeGarmo]] were the last two finalists, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner. Fantasia released as her coronation single "[[I Believe (Fantasia song)|I Believe]]", a song co-written by season one finalist Tamyra Gray, and DeGarmo released "[[Dreams (Diana DeGarmo song)|Dreams]]".

===Season 4===

[[File:Carrie underwood14052007 by cmgoonie9 cropped.jpg|right|upright|thumb|[[Carrie Underwood]], [[American Idol (season 4)|season four]] winner]]
Season four premiered on January 18, 2005; this was the first season of the series to be aired in high definition, although the finale of season three was also aired in high definition. The number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season. The age limit was raised to 28 in this season,<ref name="season 4 rules">{{cite web|url=//www.americanidol.com/archive/season3/showinfo/rules.htm |title=Season 4 rules |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=April 22, 2006 |accessdate=August 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422104846/www.americanidol.com/archive/season3/showinfo/rules.htm |archivedate=April 22, 2006 }}</ref> and among those who benefited from this new rule were [[Constantine Maroulis]] and [[Bo Bice]], the two rockers of the show.

During the top 11 week, due to a mix-up with the contestants' telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.

In May 2005, [[Carrie Underwood]] was announced the winner, with Bice the runner-up. Both Underwood and Bice released the coronation song "[[Inside Your Heaven]]".

Despite being eliminated earlier in the season, Chris Daughtry (as lead of the band [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]]) became the most successful recording artist from this season.<ref name="usatoday 2014"/> Other contestants, such as Hicks, McPhee, [[Bucky Covington]], [[Mandisa]], [[Kellie Pickler]], and [[Elliott Yamin]] have had varying levels of success.

This season saw the first ''Idol Gives Back'' telethon-inspired event, which raised more than $76&nbsp;million in corporate and viewer donations.<ref name="idol gives back"/> No contestant was eliminated that week, but two ([[Phil Stacey]] and [[Chris Richardson]]) were eliminated the next. [[Melinda Doolittle]] was eliminated in the final three.

In the May 23 season finale, [[Jordin Sparks]] was declared the winner with the runner-up being [[Blake Lewis]]. Sparks has had some success as a recording artist post-''Idol''.

This season also saw the launch of the ''American Idol'' Songwriter contest which allows fans to vote for the "coronation song". Thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters, and 20 entries selected for the public vote. The winning song, "[[This Is My Now]]", was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by Sparks on May 24, 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eonline.com/news/55228/jordin-sparks-idol-finale |title=Jordin Sparks Idol Finale |author= Natalie Finn |date= May 23, 2007 |work=E Online }}</ref>

The media focused on the professional status of the season seven contestants, the so-called 'ringers',<ref name="ringers">{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/american-idol/another-american-idol-controve-3975.aspx |title=American Idol Controversy: The Ringers of Season 7 |publisher=Buddytv.com |date=January 30, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> many of whom, including [[Kristy Lee Cook]], [[Brooke White]], [[Michael Johns (singer)|Michael Johns]], and in particular [[Carly Smithson]], had prior recording contracts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/13980/irish-idol-smithsons-secret-past |title=Irish Idol: Smithson's Secret Past |publisher=New.music.yahoo.com |date=February 14, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Contestant [[David Hernandez (singer)|David Hernandez]] also attracted some attention due to his past employment as a stripper.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1582800/20080305/story.jhtml |title='American Idol' Producer OKs David Hernandez's Stripper Past; Show Keeps Mum On Danny Noriega Video |publisher=Mtv |date=March 5, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

For the finals, ''American Idol'' debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on March 11, 2008, along with a new on-air look. [[David Cook (singer)|David Cook]]'s performance of "[[Billie Jean]]" on top-ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the [[Chris Cornell]] arrangement to be David Cook's own even though the performance was introduced as Cornell's version.

[[David Archuleta]]'s performance of John Lennon's "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" was considered by many as one of the best of the season. Jennifer Lopez, who was brought in as a judge in season ten, called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/idolchatter/post/2011/01/jennifer-lopez-says-new-idol-judges-are-more-collaborative/1 |title=Jennifer Lopez says new 'Idol' judges are 'more collaborative' |work=USA Today |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2011 |first=Brian |last=Mansfield}}</ref> [[Jason Castro (singer)|Jason Castro]]'s semi-final performance of "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]" also received considerable attention, and it propelled [[Jeff Buckley]]'s version of the song to the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Digital Songs|digital song]] chart.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jeff-buckleys-hallelujah-becomes-americas-number-one-digital-song-56916532.html |title= Jeff Buckley's 'Hallelujah' Becomes America's Number One Digital Song |publisher= PRNewswire |date= March 13, 2008 |accessdate= November 6, 2012 }}</ref>  This was the first season in which contestants' recordings were released onto [[iTunes]] after their performances, and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated that contestants' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rickey.org/?p=7483 |title=David Cook – "Billie Jean" – # 1 Song on iTunes |publisher=Rickey.org |date=March 27, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

The finalists were Cook and Archuleta. David Cook was announced the winner on May 21, 2008, the first rocker to win the show. Both Cook and Archuleta had some success as recording artists with both selling over a million albums in the U.S.<ref name="usatoday 2014"/>

The ''American Idol'' Songwriter contest was also held this season. From ten of the most popular submissions, each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform, although neither of their selections was used as the "coronation song". The winning song, "[[The Time of My Life (David Cook song)|The Time of My Life]]", was recorded by David Cook and released on May 22, 2008.

===Season 8===
{{Main|American Idol (season 8)}}
[[File:Kris Allen.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kris Allen]], [[American Idol (season 8)|season eight]] winner]]
Season eight premiered on January 13, 2009. [[Mike Darnell]], the president of alternative programming for Fox, stated that the season would focus more on the contestants' personal life.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hazlett |first=Courtney |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28002633/ |title='Idol's' emotional focus will highlight Abdul |publisher=MSNBC |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}</ref> Much early attention on the show was therefore focused on the widowhood of [[Danny Gokey]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

In the first major change to the judging panel, a fourth judge, [[Kara DioGuardi]], was introduced. This was also the first season without executive producer [[Nigel Lythgoe]] who left to focus on the international versions of his show ''[[So You Think You Can Dance (US)|So You Think You Can Dance]]''.<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20216860,00.html Lythgoe Leaving 'American Idol'] Retrieved on May 8, 2008.</ref> The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. ''Idol Gives Back'' was canceled for this season due to the [[Late-2000s recession|global recession]] at the time.

There were 13 finalists this season, but two were eliminated in the first result show of the finals. A new feature introduced was the "Judges' Save", and [[Matt Giraud]] was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes. The next week, [[Lil Rounds]] and [[Anoop Desai]] were eliminated.

The two finalists were [[Kris Allen]] and [[Adam Lambert]], both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since season two. It was claimed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/report-kris-allen-home-state-cast-38-million-american-idol-votes-9015.php |title=Report: Kris Allen's home state cast 38&nbsp;million 'American Idol' votes |publisher=Realitytvworld.com |date=May 21, 2009 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> and then later retracted,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox16.com/news/local/story/Conway-reacts-to-Kris-win/sv8BNSsGY0G8GRZWSr0fRw.cspx |title=Conway reacts to Kris' win |publisher=Fox16.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> that 38&nbsp;million of the 100&nbsp;million votes cast on the night came from Allen's home state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&T employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.<ref name="textgate">{{Cite news

Both Allen and Lambert released the coronation song, "[[No Boundaries (song)|No Boundaries]]" which was co-written by DioGuardi. This is the first season in which the winner failed to achieve gold album status,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdkxBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=I Want to Change My Life: Can Reality TV Competition Shows Trigger Lasting Career Success? |pages=34–35|author= Barrie Gunter |isbn=9781443864749 }}</ref> and none from that season achieved platinum album status in the U.S.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Season nine premiered on January 12, 2010. The upheaval at the judging panel continued. [[Ellen DeGeneres]] joined as a judge to replace Paula Abdul at the start of Hollywood Week.

One of the most prominent auditioners this season was General [[Larry Platt]] whose performance of "[[Pants on the Ground]]" became a viral hit song.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Singh |first=Anita |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/6998810/Pants-On-The-Ground-video-American-Idols-General-Larry-Platt-is-overnight-star.html |title=Pants On The Ground video: American Idol's General Larry Platt is overnight star |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

[[Crystal Bowersox]], who has [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type-I diabetes]], fell ill due to [[diabetic ketoacidosis]] on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized.<ref name="crystal"/> The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead; she later revealed that Ken Warwick, the show producer, wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show.<ref name="crystal">{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetesmine.com/2010/09/crystal-bowersox-her-first-interview-on-diabetes.html |title=Crystal Bowersox: Her First Interview on Diabetes |publisher=Diabetesmine.com |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

[[Michael Lynche]] was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the Judges' Save. The next week [[Katie Stevens]] and [[Andrew Garcia]] were eliminated. That week, Adam Lambert was invited back to be a mentor, the first ''Idol'' alum to do so. ''Idol Gives Back'' returned this season on April 21, 2010, and raised $45 million.<ref name="idol gives back"/>

A special tribute to Simon Cowell was presented in the finale for his final season with the show. Many figures from the show's past, including Paula Abdul, made an appearance.

The final two contestants were [[Lee DeWyze]] and Bowersox. DeWyze was declared the winner during the May 26 finale. No new song was used as coronation song this year; instead, the two finalists each released a cover song – DeWyze chose [[U2]]'s "[[Beautiful Day]]", and Bowersox chose [[Patty Griffin]]'s "[[Up to the Mountain (MLK Song)|Up to the Mountain]]". This is the first season where neither finalist achieved significant album sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/10/21/crystal-bowersox-lee-dewyze-dropped-rca-scotty-mccreery-lauren-alaina/ |title=Crystal Bowersox, Lee DeWyze both dropped by their record label: For 'Idol', what a difference a year makes |author= Grady Smith |date= October 21, 2011 |work=EW }}</ref>

Season ten of the series premiered on January 19, 2011. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Steven Tyler]] joined [[Randy Jackson]] as judges following the departures of [[Simon Cowell]] (who left to launch the U.S. version of ''[[The X Factor (U.S.)|The X Factor]]''), [[Kara DioGuardi]] (whose contract was not renewed) and [[Ellen DeGeneres]],<ref name="newjudges">{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1648433/20100922/lopez_jennifer.jhtml |title='American Idol' Adds Jennifer Lopez, Steven Tyler As Judges |publisher=Mtv |date=September 22, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> while [[Nigel Lythgoe]] returned as executive producer. [[Jimmy Iovine]], chairman of the [[Interscope Geffen A&M]] label group, the new partner of ''American Idol'', acted as the in-house mentor in place of weekly guest mentors,<ref name="newjudges"/> although in later episodes special guest mentors such as [[Beyoncé]], [[will.i.am]] and [[Lady Gaga]] were brought in.

Season ten is the first to include online auditions where contestants could submit a 40-second video audition via Myspace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popeater.com/2010/09/15/american-idol-online-auditions/ |title=American Idol Accepting Online Auditions This Season |publisher=Popeater.com |date=September 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> [[Karen Rodriguez]] was one such auditioner and reached the final rounds.

One of the more prominent contestants this year was [[Chris Medina]], whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fiancée received widespread coverage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1656795/chris-medina-american-idol/|title=Chris Medina’s ‘American Idol’ Story Recalls Danny Gokey’s |author=Gil Kaufman |date=January 27, 2011 |work=MTV }}</ref> Medina was cut in the Top 40 round. [[Casey Abrams]], who suffers from [[ulcerative colitis]], was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show. The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11, and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10. In the following week, [[Naima Adedapo]] and [[Thia Megia]] were both eliminated the following week.

[[Pia Toscano]], one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season, was unexpectedly eliminated on April 7, 2011, finishing in ninth place. Her elimination drew criticisms from some former ''Idol'' contestants, as well as actor [[Tom Hanks]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Us Weekly |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/jennifer-hudson-tom-hanks-outraged-over-pia-toscanos-idol-elimination-20110408 |title=Jennifer Hudson, Tom Hanks Outraged Over Pia Toscano's 'Idol' Elimination &#124; Rolling Stone Culture |work=Rolling Stone |date=April 8, 2011 |accessdate=August 6, 2011}}</ref>

The two finalists in 2011 were [[Lauren Alaina]] and [[Scotty McCreery]], both teenage country singers. McCreery won the competition on May 25, being the youngest male winner and the fourth male in a row to win ''American Idol''. McCreery released his first single, "[[I Love You This Big]]", as his coronation song, and Alaina released "[[Like My Mother Does]]". McCreery's debut album, ''[[Clear as Day]]'', became the first debut album by an ''Idol'' winner to reach No. 1 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since [[Ruben Studdard]]'s ''[[Soulful (Ruben Studdard album)|Soulful]]'' in 2003, and he became the youngest male artist to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/466103/idols-scotty-mccreery-makes-history-at-no-1-on-billboard-200 |title='Idol's' Scotty McCreery Makes History at No. 1 on Billboard 200 |publisher=Billboard |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=May 19, 2013}}</ref>

[[Jessica Sanchez]] received the fewest number of votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their "save" option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, unlike previous seasons, [[Colton Dixon]] was the only contestant sent home. Sanchez later made the final two, the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale.

Phillips became the winner, beating Sanchez. Prior to the announcement of the winner, season five finalist [[Ace Young]] proposed marriage to season three runner-up [[Diana DeGarmo]] on stage – which she accepted.

Phillips released "[[Home (Phillip Phillips song)|Home]]" as his coronation song, while Sanchez released "[[Change Nothing (song)|Change Nothing]]".  Phillips' "Home" has since become the best selling of all coronation songs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart-watch/chart-watch-extra-american-idol-top-dozen-171239977.html |title=Chart Watch Extra: Phillip Phillips’ Idol Record |author=Paul Grein |work=Chart Watch |publisher= Yahoo Music |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate=October 24, 2012 }}</ref>

Season 12 premiered on January 16, 2013. Judges [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Steven Tyler]] left the show after two seasons. This season's judging panel consisted of [[Randy Jackson]], along with [[Mariah Carey]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Nicki Minaj]]. This was the first season since [[American Idol (season 9)|season nine]] to have four judges on the panel.  The pre-season buzz and the early episodes of the show were dominated by the feud between the judges Minaj and Carey after a video of their dispute was leaked to [[TMZ (website)|TMZ]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2013/01/23/american-idol-nicki-minaj-mariah-carey-fight-country/ |title='American Idol': Nicki Minaj-Mariah Carey brawl sparked by disagreement over 'country thing' |author=Annie Barrett |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 23, 2013 }}</ref>

The top 10 contestants started with five males and five females, however, the males were eliminated consecutively in the first five weeks, with [[Lazaro Arbos]] the last male to be eliminated. For the first time in the show's history, the top 5 contestants were all female. It was also the first time that the judges' "save" was not used, the top four contestants were therefore given an extra week to perform again with their votes carried over with no elimination in the first week.

23-year-old [[Candice Glover]] won the season with [[Kree Harrison]] taking the runner-up spot. Glover is the first female to win ''American Idol'' since [[Jordin Sparks]]. She was also the final female to win the series. Glover released "[[I Am Beautiful]]" as a single while Harrison released "[[All Cried Out (Kree Harrison song)|All Cried Out]]" immediately after the show.  Glover sold poorly with her debut album, and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/aa-ways-american-idol-is-trying-to-win-you-back-20140113 |title=10 Ways ‘American Idol’ is Trying to Win You Back|work= RollingStone |author=Lyndsey Parker |date=January 13, 2014 }}</ref>

Throughout the series, eleven of the fifteen ''Idol'' winners, including its first five, had come from the [[Southern United States]].<ref name="MSNBC10">{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34611375|title=Year after year, 'Idol' has a Southern accent|author=Kevin Downey|publisher=MSNBC|date=January 11, 2010|accessdate=April 15, 2010}}</ref> A large number of other notable finalists during the series' run have also hailed from the American South, including Clay Aiken, Kellie Pickler, and Chris Daughtry,<ref name="MSNBC10"/> who are all from North Carolina. In 2012, an analysis of the 131 contestants who have appeared in the finals of all seasons of the show up to that point found that 48% have some connection to the Southern United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/radio-tv-talk/2012/04/23/ryan-seacrest-signs-on-to-continue-as-idol-host-most-of-the-top-6-have-southern-ties/|title=Ryan Seacrest signs on to continue as ‘Idol’ host; most of the top 6 have Southern ties|author=Rodney Ho|work=blogs.ajc.com|publisher=Cox Newspapers|date=April 23, 2012|accessdate=April 24, 2012}}</ref>

The show itself was popular in the Southern United States, with households in the Southeastern United States 10% more likely to watch ''American Idol'' during the eighth season in 2009, and those in the East Central region, such as [[Kentucky]], were 16 percent more likely to tune into the series.<ref name="MSNBC10"/> Data from [[Nielsen SoundScan]], a music-sales tracking service, showed that of the 47&nbsp;million CDs sold by ''Idol'' contestants through January 2010, 85 percent were by contestants with ties to the American South.<ref name="MSNBC10"/>

Theories given for the success of Southerners on ''Idol'' have been: more versatility with musical genres, as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households; and the strong heritage of music and singing, which is notable in the [[Bible Belt]], where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing.<ref name="MSNBC10"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/17/AR2006041701758.html |title=Who Put The Y'all In 'Idol'?|author=Neely Tucker |newspaper=The Washington Post |date= April 18, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/25/american-idol-winner-south |title=American Idol: why do southerners always seem to win? |author= Harry J Enten |publisher=Guardian |date=May 25, 2012 }}</ref> Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South, as well as local pride.<ref name="MSNBC04">{{Cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5053569/|title=Rise of the South on 'American Idol'|agency=Associated Press|publisher=MSNBC|date=May 26, 2004|accessdate=April 15, 2010}}</ref> According to season five winner Taylor Hicks, who is from the state of [[Alabama]], "People in the South have a lot of pride ...

==Controversy==
{{Main|American Idol controversies}}
The show had been criticized in earlier seasons over the onerous contract contestants had to sign that gave excessive control to [[19 Entertainment]] over their future career,<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100212095247/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/feature/2002/09/18/idol_contract |archivedate = February 12, 2010 |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/feature/2002/09/18/idol_contract |title=Slaves of Celebrity |publisher=Salon.com |date=September 18, 2002 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> and handed a large part of their future earnings to the management.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kerensky |first=Lauren |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16657314/ |title=WWealth doesn't trickle down to 'Idol' talent |publisher=MSNBC |date=January 16, 2007 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/3943498 |title=Simon Fuller: 'American Idol' Svengali |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

Voting results have been a consistent source of controversy. The mechanism of voting had also aroused considerable criticisms, most notably in season two when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote,<ref name="Your Vote Doesn't Count"/> and in season eight, when the massive increase in text votes (100&nbsp;million more text votes than season 7)<ref name="ATT 2009"/> fueled the texting controversy.<ref name="textgate"/> Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the very first season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Susman |first=Gary |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20312226_338679,00.html |title=Uncalled For |publisher=Ew.com |date=August 19, 2002 |accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref> Since 2004, votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as [[DialIdol]], and [[Vote for the Worst]].

''American Idol'' premiered in June 2002 and became the surprise summer hit show of 2002.

Season six premiered with the series' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most watched episodes of ''American Idol.'' During this time, many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before,<ref name="carter" /> as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC's ''[[The Cosby Show]]''. The show was dubbed "the [[Death Star]]",<ref name="death star"/> and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses.<ref name="carter"/> However, season six also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season. The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year. Season six was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.<ref name="realitytvworld_5/24/2007"/>

The loss of viewers continued into season seven.

==Cultural impact==

===Television===
The enormous success of the show and the revenue it generated was transformative for the Fox Broadcasting Company. ''American Idol'' and fellow competing shows ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (U.S. game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]'' were altogether credited for expanding [[reality television]] programming in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s, and ''Idol'' became the most watched non-scripted primetime television series for almost a decade, from 2003 to 2012, breaking records on U.S. television (dominated by [[drama]] shows and [[sitcoms]] in the preceding decades).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3b1653a0-d671-11df-81f0-00144feabdc0.html |title=A tale of two Simons |work=Financial Times |date=October 15, 2010 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Early reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' considered that "As TV, ''American Idol'' is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential".<ref>{{cite news|author=Ken Tucker |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,269319,00.html |title=American Idol 2002–2002 |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=July 4, 2002 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Others, however, thought that "the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed".<ref name="Watching TV: six decades of American television"/> It was also described as a "sadistic musical bake-off",<ref>{{cite web |author= Carina Chocano |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/diary/2002/09/04/american_idol |title=How to make an "American Idol" |work=Salon.com |date=September 4, 2002 |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}</ref> and "a romp in humiliation".<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Jewel |url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com/news2002/jun02/jun10/5_fri/news3friday.html |title='American Idol,' so needlessly cruel |work=Medialife magazine |date=June 14, 2002 |accessdate=October 21, 2011}}</ref> Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms.

Some of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of ''Entertainment Weekly'', thought that "for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, ''Idol'' provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business."<ref>{{Cite news
