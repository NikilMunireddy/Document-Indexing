He is regarded as one of the major composers of the 20th century.

Born into a musical family, Rachmaninoff took up the piano at age four. He graduated from the [[Moscow Conservatory]] in 1892 and had composed several piano and orchestral pieces by this time. In 1897, following the critical reaction to his [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 1]], Rachmaninoff entered a four-year depression and composed little until successful therapy allowed him to complete his enthusiastically-received [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]] in 1901. After the [[Russian Revolution]], Rachmaninoff and his family left Russia and resided in the [[United States]], first in [[New York City]]. Demanding piano concert tour schedules caused his output as composer to slow tremendously; between 1918 and 1943, he completed just six compositions, including ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]'', [[Symphony No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 3]], and ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]''. In 1942, Rachmaninoff moved to [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[California]]. He acquired U.S. citizenship a month before his death from advanced [[melanoma]].

Early influences of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], and other Russian composers gave way to a personal style notable for its song-like melodicism, expressiveness and his use of rich orchestral colors.<ref name="ng707">[[#Norris|Norris]], 707.</ref> The piano is featured prominently in Rachmaninoff's compositional output, and through his own skills as a performer he explored the expressive possibilities of the instrument.

==Biography==

=== 1873–1891: Early years ===
[[File:Rakhmaninov.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The coat of arms of the Rachmaninoff family.]]
Rachmaninoff was born at a family estate in the [[Novgorod Oblast|Novgorod province]] in north western Russia. It is unclear if he was born in the estate of Oneg, near [[Veliky Novgorod]], or Semyonovo, near [[Staraya Russa]], but Rachmannoff would cite Oneg as his place of birth throughout his adult life.{{sfn|Sylvester|2014|p=2}}<ref name="dictionary">{{cite book |last=Randel |first=Don M. |title=The Harvard Concise Dictionary of Music and Musicians |year=1999 |authorlink=Don Michael Randel |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] (Belknap) |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]] |isbn=0-674-00978-9 |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674009783 }}</ref> His family was Russian and distant [[Principality of Moldavia|Moldavian]] descent who was part of the [[Russian aristocracy]], having been in the service of the Russian [[tsar]]s since the 16th century, and had strong musical and military leanings. His father, Vasily Arkadyevich Rachmaninoff (1841–1916), an amateur pianist and army officer, married Lyubov Petrovna Butakova (1853–1929), gained five estates as a [[dowry]] and together had three boys and three girls.<ref name="z">[[#Harrison|Harrison]]</ref>

Rachmaninoff began playing the piano and reading music at age four by his mother,{{sfn|Sylvester|2014|p=2}} who became impressed with his ability to recite passages from memory without playing a wrong note. News of his ability reached his paternal grandfather Arkady, who told Rachmaninoff's father to bring in Anna Ornatskaya, a teacher from [[Saint Petersburg]] and friend of Rachmaninoff's mother, to live with the family and teach him formally in 1880. Rachmaninoff later dedicated "Spring Waters", Song No. 32 to Ornatskaya.{{sfn|Sylvester|2014|p=3}} In 1882, Rachmaninoff's father had to auction off their home due to his financial incompetence—his five estates had been reduced to one; he was described as "a wastrel, a compulsive gambler, a pathological liar, and a skirt chaser".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netmagic.net/~sapiens/rach/bio.html |title=Rach Bio |accessdate=13 September 2008 |author=Accardi, Julie Ciamporcero |year=2008 |work=Rachmaninoff }}</ref>{{sfn|Greene|1985|p=1004}} The family then moved to a small flat in Saint Petersburg.{{sfn|von Riesemann|1934}} Before Ornatskaya left to return home, she arranged for Rachmaninoff to study at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]], which he entered in 1883, at age ten. That year his sister Sofia died of [[diphtheria]], and his father left the family, with their approval, for [[Moscow]].<ref name="z" /> His maternal grandmother stepped in to help raise the children with particular focus on their spiritual life, regularly taking Rachmaninoff to [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox church]] services where he was first exposed to the [[Liturgy|liturgical]] chants and [[church bell]]s, which would later permeate his future compositions.{{sfn|von Riesemann|1934}}

In 1885, Rachmaninoff suffered from another family tragedy. His sister Yelena was about to join the [[Bolshoi Theatre]] company, after being offered coaching and private lessons, but fell ill and died of [[pernicious anemia]] at 18. She was an important musical influence and introduced Rachmaninoff to the music of [[Tchaikovsky]]. As a respite, his grandmother Butakova took him to a farm retreat on the [[Volkhov River]] where he had a boat and developed a love for rowing.<ref name="z" /> Having been spoiled in this way, Rachmaninoff became lazy and failed his [[Core curriculum|general education]] classes and altered his report cards in what [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] would later call a period of "purely Russian self-delusion and laziness."{{sfn|Rimsky-Korsakov|1989|pp=94–95}} In 1885, back at the Conservatory, Rachmaninoff played at important events often attended by [[Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia|Grand Duke Konstantin]] and other important people, but he failed his spring exams, leaving Ornatskaya to notify his mother that his admission might be revoked.<ref name="z" /> His mother consulted with her nephew [[Alexander Siloti]] (by marriage), an accomplished pianist studying under [[Franz Liszt]] who praised Rachmaninoff for his piano and listening skills, recommended that he attend the [[Moscow Conservatory]] to study with his own original teacher, the more strict [[Nikolai Zverev]],{{sfn|Bertensson|Leyda|2001|p=46}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/Paris/3486/rachmani.html |title=Sergei Rachmaninoff |accessdate=14 December 2007 |author=Giulimondi, Gabriele |date=20 December 2000 |work=The Internet Piano Page |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080112152153/http://www.geocities.com/Paris/3486/rachmani.html|archivedate=12 January 2008}}</ref> from 1885 to 1888.{{sfn|Sylvester|2014|pp=6–7}}

===1891–1895: Graduation and early compositions===
Rachmaninoff would find his first romance in the neighbouring Skalon family with Vera, the youngest of three daughters. However, her mother objected and forbid Rachmaninoff to write to her, leaving him to correspond with her older sister Natalia. It is from these letters that much of Rachmaninoff's [[Miscellaneous solo piano compositions (Rachmaninoff)|early compositions]] can be detailed.{{sfn|Bertensson|Leyda|2001|p=46}} During his final studies at the Conservatory he completed the ''[[Youth Symphony (Rachmaninoff)|Youth Symphony]]'', a one-movement symphonic piece, ''[[Prince Rostislav (Rachmaninoff)|Prince Rostislav]]'', a [[symphonic poem]], and ''[[The Rock (Rachmaninoff)|The Rock]]'' (Op.&nbsp;7), a [[fantasia (music)|fantasia]] for orchestra.<ref name="z" /> In the spring of 1891, he passed his final piano exams at the Moscow Conservatory with honours. He then moved to [[Ivanovka estate]] with Siloti and began composing his [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto {{nowrap|No. 1}}]] (Op.&nbsp;1).

[[File:Rachmaninoff 1900.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rachmaninoff in the early 1900s, before he graduated from the [[Moscow Conservatory]].]]
On 11 February 1892, Rachmaninoff performed his first independent concert where he premiered his [[Trio élégiaque No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|''Trio élégiaque'' {{nowrap|No. 1}}]] with violinist David Kreyn and cellist [[Anatoliy Brandukov]]. This was followed by a performance of the first movement of his Piano Concerto {{nowrap|No. 1}} on 29 March.<ref name="norris">{{cite book |last=Norris |first=Geoffrey |title=The Master Musicians: Rachmaninoff |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aPc2AAAACAAJ |year=1993 |publisher=[[G.

Rachmaninoff continued to compose, publishing at this time his Six Songs (Op.&nbsp;4) and Two Pieces (Op.&nbsp;2). He spent the summer of 1892 on the estate of Ivan Konavalov, a rich landowner in the [[Kostroma Oblast]], and moved back with the Satins in the [[Arbat District]].<ref name="z" /> His publisher was slow in paying, so Rachmaninoff took an engagement at the Moscow Electrical Exhibition, where he premiered his landmark [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]] (Op.&nbsp;3, No.&nbsp;2).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naxosdirect.com/title/8.550348 |title=RACHMANINOV: Preludes Op.&nbsp;23 / Cinq morceaux de fantaisie |accessdate=15 March 2008 |year=2008 |work=[[Naxos Records]] }}</ref> This small piece, part of a set of five pieces called ''[[Morceaux de fantaisie]]'', was received well, and is one of his most enduring pieces.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guildmusic.com/catalog/gui7310z.htm |title=Martin Werner Plays: Schubert – Schumann – Grieg – Chopin – Rachmaninoff – Felder |accessdate=15 March 2008 |date=31 May 2007 |work=Guild Music }}</ref><ref name="boosey">{{cite web |url=http://www.boosey.com/pages/cr/composer/composer_main.asp?composerid=2861&ttitle=Biography&ttype=BIOGRAPHY |title=Sergei Rachmaninoff – Composer page |accessdate=21 March 2008 |year=2008 |work=[[Boosey & Hawkes]] }}</ref>

Rachmaninoff spent the summer of 1893 in [[Lebedyn]] with some friends, where he composed [[Suite No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|''Fantaisie-Tableaux'']] (Suite {{nowrap|No. 1}}, Op.&nbsp;5) and his ''[[Morceaux de salon (Rachmaninoff)|Morceaux de salon]]'' (Op.&nbsp;10).{{sfn|Threlfall|1982|p=45}} At the summer's end, he moved back to Moscow, and at Sergei Taneyev's house discussed with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] the possibility of his conducting ''[[The Rock (Rachmaninoff)|The Rock]]'' at its premiere. However, because it had to be premiered in Moscow, not [[Europe]], where Tchaikovsky was touring, [[Vasily Safonov]] conducted it instead, and the two met soon after for [[Nikolai Zverev|Zverev]]'s funeral. Rachmaninoff had a short excursion to conduct ''Aleko'' in [[Kiev]], and on his return, received the news about [[Death of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky's unexpected death]] on {{OldStyleDate|6&nbsp;November|1893|25 October}}. On the same day, he began work on his [[Trio élégiaque No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|''Trio élégiaque'' {{nowrap|No. 2}}]], just as Tchaikovsky had quickly written his [[Piano Trio (Tchaikovsky)|Trio in A minor]] after [[Nikolai Rubinstein]]'s death. The music's overwhelming aura of gloom reveals the depth and sincerity of his grief.<ref name="ng709">[[#Norris|Norris]], 709.</ref>

===1895–1917: Setbacks and recovery===
Rachmaninoff premiered his [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 1]] (Op.&nbsp;13, 1896) on 28 March 1897 in one of a long-running series of [[Russian Symphony Concerts]]. The piece was brutally panned by critic and nationalist composer [[César Cui]], who likened it to a depiction of the [[Plagues of Egypt|ten plagues of Egypt]], suggesting it would be admired by the "inmates" of a music conservatory in Hell.<ref>Kyui, Ts., "Tretiy russkiy simfonicheskiy kontsert," ''Novosti i birzhevaya gazeta'' (17 March 1897(o.s.)), 3.</ref> The deficiencies of the performance, conducted by [[Alexander Glazunov]], were not commented on by critics,<ref name="ng709"/> but according to a memoir from [[Alexander Ossovsky]], a close friend of Rachmaninoff,{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=77}}<ref>[[Alexander Ossovsky|Ossovsky Alexander Viacheslavovich]] (1871–1957), renowned critic and musicologist and close friend of Rachmaninoff, see external links.</ref> Glazunov made poor use of rehearsal time, and the concert's program itself, which contained two other premières, was also a factor. Other witnesses suggested that Glazunov, an alcoholic, may have been drunk, although this was never intimated by Rachmaninoff.<ref name= glazbbc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/aboutmusic/glazunov_violincon.shtml|publisher= BBC|title= Programme notes for Proms performance of Glazunov's Violin Concerto|author=Lewis, Geraint }}</ref><ref name= glazdgg>Brown, David.

[[File:Rachmaninoff and Skalon sisters crop.jpg|thumb|left|The failure of his Symphony No. 1 sent Rachmaninoff, pictured here in 1897, into a four-year depression and writer's block]]
Following the events and critical reaction of his first symphony, Rachmaninoff fell into a deep depression that lasted for three years, during which he composed almost nothing due to [[writer's block]]. One stroke of good fortune came from [[Savva Mamontov]], a famous Russian industrialist and patron of the arts who founded the Moscow Private Russian Opera Company. He offered Rachmaninoff the post of assistant conductor for the 1897–98 season, to which the cash-strapped composer accepted. The company included the great basso [[Feodor Chaliapin]], who would become a lifelong friend.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=84–85}} During his time at the opera company, Rachmaninoff became engaged to his first cousin Natalia Satina, a fellow pianist whom he had known since childhood. However, the Orthodox church and Satina's parents opposed their marriage, thwarting their plans and deepening Rachmaninoff's depression.

In January 1900, Rachmaninoff began a daily course of [[hypnotherapy]] and [[psychotherapy]] with physician and amateur musician [[Nikolai Dahl]] which lasted for three months. With further support from his family and friends, the therapy recovered his confidence and eventually he was able to overcome his writer's block by completing his [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto {{nowrap|No. 2}}]] in 1901, which he dedicated to Dahl. The piece was enthusiastically received at its première at which Rachmaninoff was soloist and has since become one of the most popular and frequently played concertos in the classical music repertoire. Rachmaninoff's spirits improved further when, after three years of engagement, he was finally allowed to marry Satina on 29 April 1902,<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=50340221 Mrs Natalya Alexandrovna "Natalie" Satina Rachmaninoff (1877–1951) – Find A Grave Memorial].

They settled in Moscow, where they had two daughters: Irina Sergeievna Rachmaninova (1903 – 1969) and Tatiana Sergeievna Rachmaninova Conus (1907 – 1961).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.republicain-lorrain.fr/actualite/2013/10/26/xavier-bettel-un-jeune-liberal-presse |title=Xavier Bettel, un jeune libéral pressé |date=26 October 2013 |publisher=La Republicain Lorrain}}</ref><ref>Graaff, Laurent and Morang, Hubert (18 December 2013) [http://web.archive.org/web/20140812202434/http://www.revue.lu/aktuelles/vielleicht-nicht-der-beliebteste-premier/ Xavier Bettel "Vielleicht nicht der beliebteste Premier"].

In 1904, after several successful appearances as a conductor, Rachmaninoff accepted the role of opera conductor at the Bolshoi Theatre where he would conduct his two new operas, ''[[The Miserly Knight]]'' and [[Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninoff)|''Francesca da Rimini'']]. His position came to an end following the political unrest surrounding the [[Revolution of 1905]], resulting in his resignation in March 1906, after which he and his family went on holiday in [[Italy]] until July that year. In 1906, Rachmaninoff moved his family to [[Dresden]], [[Germany]] and spent his time intensively composing, only to return to the Ivanovka family estate in the summer.<ref name = "ng15553"/> His sense of self-worth as a symphonist was regained following the enthusiastic reaction to the premiere of his [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 2]] in early 1908, where he was awarded with his second [[Glinka State Prize of the RSFSR|Glinka Award]] ten months later. In 1909, Rachmaninoff completed his first piano concert tour of the [[United States]], an event for which he composed the [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto {{nowrap|No. 3}}]] (Op.&nbsp;30, 1909) as a calling card. These successful concerts made him a popular figure in America; however, he was unhappy on the tour and declined subsequent job offers, including an offer to become conductor of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]],<ref name="ng15551">[[#Norris|Norris]], 15:551.</ref> and requests for further American concerts until after he emigrated from Russia.<ref name="ng15553">[[#Norris|Norris]], 15:553.</ref>

In 1912, Rachmaninoff quit his position as vice-president of the [[Russian Musical Society]] in protest when he heard that a musician in an administrative post with the society was dismissed on the grounds that the musician was [[Jewish]].{{sfn|Bertensson|Leyda|2001|p=179}} Rachmaninoff biographer Sergei Bertensson wrote that Rachmaninoff took his position in the society seriously, "and for Rachmaninoff 'seriously' meant with moral as well as artistic seriousness: these were really fused in him."{{sfn|Bertensson|Leyda|2001|p=179}} Soon after his resignation, Rachmaninoff was exhausted from overworking and took his family on holiday in [[Switzerland]] and [[Rome]], during which he worked on ''[[The Bells (symphony)|The Bells]]'', but the holiday was cut short when his two daughters contracted [[typhoid]] and were treated in [[Berlin]] as he lacked trust in the Italian doctors. Rachmaninoff conducted the premiere of ''The Bells'' in Saint Petersburg in November 1913. The early death of [[Alexander Scriabin]] in 1915, a good friend and fellow student at the Moscow Conservatory, affected Rachmaninoff so deeply that he embarked on a concert tour entirely devoted to Scriabin's music. When asked to play some of his own music, he would reply: "Only Scriabin tonight".

===1917–1932: Move to America and friendship with Horowitz===
The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolutions of February and October 1917]] meant the end of Russia as Rachmaninoff had known it. A member of the Russian bourgeoisie, the Revolution led to the loss of his estate, his way of life, and livelihood. Following an offer to perform in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], Rachmaninoff left Russia by train for [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] on 22 December 1917 with his family on an open sled, having only some money, a few notebooks with sketches of his own compositions, and two orchestral scores, his unfinished opera ''[[Monna Vanna]]'', and Rimsky-Korsakov's opera ''[[The Golden Cockerel]]''. The family settled in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], though as he was in debt, Rachmaninoff reinvented himself as a concert pianist, performing concerts across [[Scandinavia]]. The task required him to learn new pieces in his repertoire.

[[File:Sergei Rachmaninoff, California.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rachmaninoff in front of a giant Redwood tree in California, 1919]]
Towards the end of 1918, news of Rachmaninoff's career as performer had reached the United States. He received several offers to work there, most of them a long term conducting role, which he felt reluctant to accept, but soon changed his mind as the country became the solution to his financial concerns. On 1 November 1918, Rachmaninoff departed [[Oslo]] for [[New York City]]. Once there, he settled in 505 West End Avenue, and accepted a piano from [[Steinway and Sons|Steinway]] as a gift, and acquired Charles Ellis as his agent who secured 40 concerts for him across the following four months. He and his family consciously recreated the atmosphere of their Ivanovka estate, entertaining Russian guests, employing Russian servants, and observing Russian customs.<ref name="ng15554">[[#Norris|Norris]], 15:554.</ref> In 1920, Rachmaninoff signed a recording contract with the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] which earned him a much needed amount of money. He became a member of the board of directors for the [[Tolstoy Foundation]] Center in [[Valley Cottage, New York]].

Rachmaninoff sought the company of fellow Russian musicians and befriended pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]]; their first meeting, arranged by Steinway artist representative Alexander Greiner, took place in the basement of [[Steinway Hall]] in New York City on 8 January 1928, four days prior to Horowitz's debut at [[Carnegie Hall]] playing Tchaikovsky's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No. 1]], which Rachmaninoff intended to attend as he had heard positive reviews of Horowitz's playing of his own [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 3]] and expressed a wish to accompany Horowitz in a performance of the piece.<ref name="gp107">Plaskin, Glenn (1983) ''Horowitz—a biography''. New York: William Morrow and Company. ISBN 0-688-01616-2. p. 107.</ref> For Horowitz, the opportunity represented a dream come true as Rachmaninoff was "the musical god of my youth ... the most unforgettable impression of my life!"<ref name="wizhorowitz"/> About the pianist's interpretation of Rachmaninoff's own third concerto, the composer said to [[Abram Chasins]] that Horowitz "swallowed it whole ... he had the courage, the intensity, the daring."<ref name="gp107"/> The men remained supportive of each other's work, each making a point of attending concerts given by the other.<ref name="wizhorowitz"/> Horowitz remained a champion of Rachmaninoff's solo works and his Piano Concerto No. 3, about which Rachmaninoff remarked publicly after 7 August 1942 performance at the [[Hollywood Bowl]]: "This is the way I always dreamed my concerto should be played, but I never expected to hear it that way on Earth."<ref name="wizhorowitz">[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=E-8ZAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_SIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4797%2C1289387 "About Wizard Horowitz, Who Will Return Soon"], ''The Milwaukee Journal'', 18 April 1943, p. 66</ref>

In 1929, conductor and music publisher [[Serge Koussevitzky]] asked Rachmaninoff if he would select pieces from his ''Études-Tableaux'' for Italian composer [[Ottorino Respighi]] to orchestrate. Rachmaninoff agreed, giving Respighi five pieces from [[Études-Tableaux, Op. 33|''Études-Tableaux'', Op. 33]] (1911) and [[Études-Tableaux, Op. 39|''Études-Tableaux'', Op. 39]] (1917) and the inspirations behind the compositions, something that he did not previously reveal. Respighi, however, titled each piece from the clues Rachmaninoff gave him and completed the orchestrations in 1930.{{sfn|Bertensson|Leyda|2001|p=262}} During his summers from 1929 to 1931, Rachmaninoff spent his time in [[Clairefontaine-en-Yvelines]] near [[Rambouillet]], [[France]], during which they would meet with fellow Russian emigrates.

===1932–1943: Final compositions and death===
Demanding concert tour schedules caused Rachmaninoff's output as composer to slow tremendously; between his arrival to the US in 1918 and his death in 1943, he completed just six compositions. Aside from the need to perform to support his family, a main reason for the lack of new compositions was his homesickness.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2 March 2008|publisher=8notes|title=Sergei Rachmaninoff Biography|url=http://www.8notes.com/biographies/rachmaninoff.asp}}</ref> His return to composing became possible in 1932 following the completion of his new home, [[Villa Senar]], near [[Hertenstein, Lucerne|Hertenstein]], [[Lake Lucerne]] in [[Switzerland]], where he retreated during his summers from 1932 to 1939. In the comfort of his own villa, which reminded him of his old family estate in Russia, Rachmaninoff composed ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]'' in 1934 and [[Symphony No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony {{nowrap|No. 3}}]] (Op.&nbsp;44, 1935–36).

In December 1939, Rachmaninoff conducted the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], his first conducting role since January 1917, his last appearance as a conductor in Russia.<ref>[http://icls.fimc.net/hearhere/article.asp?id=908031 The Royal Philharmonic Society]; Retrieved 17 October 2013</ref> In the early 1940s, he was approached by the makers of the British film ''[[Dangerous Moonlight]]'' to write a short concerto-like piece for use in the film, but he declined. The job went to [[Richard Addinsell]] and the orchestrator [[Roy Douglas]], who came up with the ''[[Warsaw Concerto]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-A-Ba/Addinsell-Richard.html|title=Richard Addinsell&nbsp;– Films as composer|accessdate=10 October 2008|publisher=filmreference.com}}</ref> Rachmaninoff's last completed work, ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'' (Op.&nbsp;45, 1940), was the only piece he composed in its entirety while living in the U.S. [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] premiered ''Symphonic Dances'' on 7 January 1941 at the [[Academy of Music (Philadelphia)|Academy of Music]].

In 1942, Rachmaninoff's doctor advised him to move to a warmer climate; his family settled in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[California]]. Later that year, Rachmaninoff fell ill during a concert tour and was later diagnosed with advanced [[melanoma]]. His family was informed, but he was not. On 1 February 1943, Rachmaninoff and Satina became American citizens.{{sfn|Cunningham|2001}} His last recital, performed on 17 February 1943 at the Alumni Gymnasium at the [[University of Tennessee]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], [[Tennessee]], included [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Piano Sonata {{nowrap|No. 2}}]] which contains a funeral march. He became so ill after the performance that he had to return home.<ref>[[#Norris|Norris]], 15:554–555.</ref> Rachmaninoff died on 28 March 1943, four days before his 70th birthday. A choir sang his ''[[All-Night Vigil (Rachmaninoff)|All Night Vigil]]'' at his funeral. He had wanted to be buried at Villa Senar, his estate in Switzerland, but the conditions of [[World War II]] made fulfilling his request impossible.<ref name="ng713">[[#Norris|Norris]], 713.</ref> Instead, he was interred on 1 June in [[Kensico Cemetery]] in [[Valhalla, New York]].<ref name="z"/> A statue marked "Rachmaninoff: The Last Concert", designed and sculpted by Victor Bokarev, stands at the World Fair Park in Knoxville as a tribute.

After Rachmaninoff's death, poet [[Marietta Shaginyan]] published fifteen letters they exchanged from their first contact in February 1912 and their final meeting in July 1917.{{sfn|Bertensson|Leyda|2001|p=176}} The nature of their relationship bordered on romantic, but was primarily intellectual and emotional. Shaginyan and the poetry she shared with Rachmaninoff has been cited as the inspiration for the six songs that make up his Six Songs, Op. 38.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Dear Re: A Glimpse into the Six Songs of Rachmaninoff's Opus 38|author=Simpson, Anne |journal=College Music Symposium|volume=24|issue=1 |year=1984|pages=97–106|jstor=40374219 }}</ref>

In August 2015, Russia announced its intentions to seek reburial of Rachmaninoff's remains in Russia, claiming that Americans have neglected the composer's grave while attempting to "shamelessly privatize" his name. The composer's descendants have resisted this idea, pointing out that he died in the U.S. after spending decades outside of Russia in self-imposed political exile.<ref name="Radio Free Europe">Bigg, Claire (18 August 2015) [http://www.rferl.org/content/russia-rachmaninoff-reburial-debate/27195441.html Rachmaninoff Family Denounces Russian Officials' Reburial Push].

{{Main|List of compositions by Sergei Rachmaninoff}}
[[File:Piano Concerto 3 Cadenza.png|thumb|350px|The cadenza of [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto {{nowrap|No. 3}}]] is famous for its large chords. ]]

Rachmaninoff wrote five works for piano and orchestra: four concertos—{{nowrap|No. 1}} in F-sharp minor, Op.&nbsp;1 (1891, revised 1917), {{nowrap|No. 2}} in C minor, Op.&nbsp;18 (1900–01), {{nowrap|No. 3}} in D minor, Op.&nbsp;30 (1909), and {{nowrap|No. 4}} in G minor, Op.&nbsp;40 (1926, revised 1928 and 1941)—plus the ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]''. Of the concertos, the [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second]] and [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third]] are the most popular.<ref>Piano Concerto {{nowrap|No. 2}} has made the top 3 of [[Classic FM (UK)]]'s Hall Of Fame poll, an annual survey of classical music tastes, every year since 1996 including {{nowrap|No. 1}} in the 2011 poll. In a poll of classical music listeners announced in October 2007, the ABC in Australia found that Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto came second, topped only by the [[Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)|"Emperor" Concerto]] of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. See [http://www.abc.net.au/classic/classic100/results.htm ABC.net.au], Retrieved on 24 August 2010</ref>

Rachmaninoff also composed a number of works for orchestra alone. The three symphonies: {{nowrap|No. 1}} in D minor, Op.&nbsp;13 (1895), {{nowrap|No. 2}} in E minor, Op.&nbsp;27 (1907), and {{nowrap|No. 3}} in A minor, Op.&nbsp;44 (1935–36). Widely spaced chronologically, the symphonies represent three distinct phases in his compositional development. The Second has  been the most popular of the three since its first performance. Other orchestral works include ''[[The Rock (Rachmaninoff)|The Rock]]'' (Op.&nbsp;7), ''[[Caprice bohémien]]'' (Op.&nbsp;12), ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|The Isle of the Dead]]'' (Op.&nbsp;29), and the ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'' (Op.&nbsp;45).

Works for piano solo include [[Preludes (Rachmaninoff)|24 Preludes traversing all 24 major and minor keys]]; [[Prelude in C-sharp minor (Rachmaninoff)|Prelude in C-sharp minor]] (Op.&nbsp;3, {{nowrap|No. 2}}) from ''[[Morceaux de fantaisie]]'' (Op.&nbsp;3); [[Preludes, Op. 23 (Rachmaninoff)|ten preludes in Op.&nbsp;23]]; and [[Preludes, Op. 32 (Rachmaninoff)|thirteen in Op.&nbsp;32]]. Especially difficult are the two sets of ''[[Études-Tableaux (disambiguation)|Études-Tableaux]]'', Op.&nbsp;33 and 39, which are very demanding ''study pictures''. Stylistically, Op.&nbsp;33 hearkens back to the preludes, while Op.&nbsp;39 shows the influences of [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]. There are also the ''[[Six moments musicaux (Rachmaninoff)|Six moments musicaux]]'' (Op.&nbsp;16), the ''[[Variations on a Theme of Chopin (Rachmaninoff)|Variations on a Theme of Chopin]]'' (Op.&nbsp;22), and the ''[[Variations on a Theme of Corelli]]'' (Op.&nbsp;42). He wrote two [[piano sonata]]s, both of which are large scale and virtuosic in their technical demands. Rachmaninoff also composed works for two pianos, four hands, including two Suites (the first subtitled ''Fantasie-Tableaux''), a version of the ''Symphonic Dances'' (Op.&nbsp;45), and an arrangement of the C-sharp minor Prelude, as well as a ''Russian Rhapsody'', and he arranged his First Symphony (below) for piano four-hands. Both these works were published posthumously.

Rachmaninoff wrote two major [[a cappella]] choral works—the ''[[Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom (Rachmaninoff)|Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]]'' and the ''[[All-Night Vigil (Rachmaninoff)|All-Night Vigil]]'' (also known as the ''Vespers''). It was the fifth movement of ''All-Night Vigil'' that Rachmaninoff requested to have sung at his funeral. Other choral works include a [[choral symphony]], ''[[The Bells (symphony)|The Bells]]''; the cantata [[Spring (Rachmaninoff)|''Spring'']]; the ''[[Three Russian Songs, Op.&nbsp;41 (Rachmaninoff)|Three Russian Songs]]''; and an early ''Concerto for Choir'' (a cappella).

He completed three operas, all short: ''[[Aleko (Rachmaninoff)|Aleko]]'' (1892), ''[[The Miserly Knight]]'' (1903), and ''[[Francesca da Rimini (Rachmaninoff)|Francesca da Rimini]]'' (1904). He started three others, notably ''[[Monna Vanna]]'', based on a work by [[Maurice Maeterlinck]]; copyright in this had been extended to the composer Février, and, though the restriction did not pertain to Russia, Rachmaninoff dropped the project after completing Act I in piano vocal score in 1908; this act was orchestrated in 1984 by [[Igor Buketoff]] and performed in the U.S. ''Aleko'' is regularly performed and has been recorded complete at least eight times, and filmed. ''The Miserly Knight'' adheres to Pushkin's "little tragedy". ''Francesca da Rimini'' exists somewhat in the shadow{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} of the opera of the same name by [[Riccardo Zandonai]].

His chamber music includes two piano trios, both which are named ''Trio Elégiaque'' (the second of which is a memorial tribute to Tchaikovsky), and a [[Cello Sonata (Rachmaninoff)|Cello Sonata]]. He also composed many songs for voice and piano, to texts by [[Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy|A. N. Tolstoy]], [[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], [[Victor Hugo|Hugo]] and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]], among others. Among his most popular songs is the wordless ''[[Vocalise (Rachmaninoff)|Vocalise]]''.

===Compositional style===
[[File:Sergei Rachmaninoff LOC 31755.jpg|thumb|Rachmaninoff with a piano score]]
Rachmaninoff's style showed initially the influence of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]. Beginning in the mid-1890s, his compositions began showing a more individual tone. His First Symphony has many original features. Its brutal gestures and uncompromising power of expression were unprecedented in Russian music at the time. Its flexible [[rhythm]]s, sweeping lyricism and stringent economy of thematic material were all features he kept and refined in subsequent works. After the three fallow years following the poor reception of the symphony, Rachmaninoff's style began developing significantly. He started leaning towards sumptuous [[harmony|harmonies]] and broadly lyrical, often passionate melodies. His orchestration became subtler and more varied, with textures carefully contrasted, and his writing on the whole became more concise.<ref name="ng714715">[[#Norris|Norris]], 714–715.</ref>

Especially important is Rachmaninoff's use of unusually widely spaced chords for bell-like sounds: this occurs in many pieces, most notably in the [[choral symphony]] ''The Bells'', the Second Piano Concerto, the E flat major ''Étude-Tableaux'' (Op.&nbsp;33, {{nowrap|No. 7}}), and the B-minor Prelude (Op.&nbsp;32, {{nowrap|No. 10}}). "It is not enough to say that the church bells of Novgorod, St Petersburg and Moscow influenced Rachmaninov and feature prominently in his music. This much is self-evident. What is extraordinary is the variety of bell sounds and breadth of structural and other functions they fulfil."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Carruthers |first= Glen |year= 2006 |title= The (re)appraisal of Rachmaninov's music: contradictions and fallacies |url= http://www.scribd.com/doc/102184282/Contradictions-in-Rach |journal= [[The Musical Times]] |volume= 147 |pages= 44–50 |jstor= 25434403 |doi=10.2307/25434403}}</ref> He was also fond of Russian Orthodox chants. He uses them most perceptibly in his ''Vespers'', but many of his melodies found their origins in these chants. The opening melody of the First Symphony is derived from chants. (The opening melody of the Third Piano Concerto, on the other hand, is not derived from chants; when asked, Rachmaninoff said that "it had written itself".)<ref>{{Cite journal

Rachmaninoff's frequently used motifs include the ''[[Dies Irae]]'', often just the fragments of the first phrase.
Rachmaninoff had great command of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue|fugal]] writing, thanks to his studies with Taneyev. The above-mentioned occurrence of the ''Dies Irae'' in the [[Symphony No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Second Symphony]] (1907) is but a small example of this. Very characteristic of his writing is [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] counterpoint. This talent was paired with a confidence in writing in both large- and small-scale forms. The [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third Piano Concerto]] especially shows a structural ingenuity, while each of the preludes grows from a tiny melodic or rhythmic fragment into a taut, powerfully evocative miniature, crystallizing a particular mood or sentiment while employing a complexity of texture, rhythmic flexibility and a pungent chromatic harmony.<ref name="ng715">[[#Norris|Norris]], 715.</ref>

His compositional style had already begun changing before the [[October Revolution]] deprived him of his homeland. The [[harmony|harmonic]] writing in ''The Bells'' was composed in 1913 but not published until 1920. This may have been due to Rachmaninoff's main publisher, Gutheil, having died in 1914 and Gutheil's catalog being acquired by [[Serge Koussevitsky]].{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=191}} It became as advanced as in any of the works Rachmaninoff would write in Russia, partly because the melodic material has a harmonic aspect which arises from its [[chromaticism|chromatic]] [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]].{{sfn|Harrison|2006|pp=190–191}} Further changes are apparent in the revised [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|First Piano Concerto]], which he finished just before leaving Russia, as well as in the Op.&nbsp;38 songs and Op.&nbsp;39 [[Études-Tableaux, Op. 39|Études-Tableaux]]. In both these sets Rachmaninoff was less concerned with pure melody than with coloring. His near-[[Impressionism|Impressionist]] style perfectly matched the texts by [[symbolist]] poets.<ref name="ng716"/> The Op.&nbsp;39 Études-Tableaux are among the most demanding pieces he wrote for any medium, both technically and in the sense that the player must see beyond any technical challenges to a considerable array of emotions, then unify all these aspects{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=207}}

The composer's friend Vladimir Wilshaw noticed this compositional change continuing in the early 1930s, with a difference between the sometimes very extroverted Op.&nbsp;39 Études-Tableaux (the composer had broken a string on the piano at one performance) and the ''[[Variations on a Theme of Corelli]]'' (Op.&nbsp;42, 1931). The variations show an even greater textural clarity than in the Op.&nbsp;38 songs, combined with a more abrasive use of chromatic harmony and a new rhythmic incisiveness. This would be characteristic of all his later works—the [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto {{nowrap|No. 4}}]] (Op.&nbsp;40, 1926) is composed in a more emotionally introverted style, with a greater clarity of texture. Nevertheless, some of his most beautiful (nostalgic and melancholy) melodies occur in the [[Symphony No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third Symphony]], ''[[Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini]]'', and ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]''.<ref name="ng716">[[#Norris|Norris]], 716.</ref>

===Fluctuating reputation===
His reputation as a composer generated a variety of opinions before his music gained steady recognition across the world. The 1954 edition of the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' notoriously dismissed Rachmaninoff's music as "monotonous in texture ... consist[ing] mainly of artificial and gushing tunes" and predicted that his popular success was "not likely to last".<ref name = "sc520"/> To this, [[Harold C. Schonberg]], in his ''Lives of the Great Composers'', responded: "It is one of the most outrageously snobbish and even stupid statements ever to be found in a work that is supposed to be an objective reference."<ref name="sc520">[[#Composers|Schonberg 1998, ''Composers'']], p. 520.</ref>

The [[Conservatoire Rachmaninoff]] in Paris, as well as streets in [[Veliky Novgorod]] (which is close to his birthplace) and [[Tambov]], are named after the composer. In 1986, the Moscow Conservatory dedicated a concert hall on its premises to Rachmaninoff, designating the 252-seat auditorium Rachmaninoff Hall. A monument to Rachmaninoff was unveiled in Veliky Novgorod, near his birthplace, on 14 June 2009.

==Pianism==

===Technique===
Rachmaninoff ranked among the finest pianists of his time, along with [[Leopold Godowsky]], [[Ignaz Friedman]], [[Moriz Rosenthal]], [[Josef Lhévinne]], and [[Josef Hofmann]] and he was famed for possessing a clean and virtuosic technique. His playing was marked by precision, rhythmic drive, notable use of staccato and the ability to maintain clarity when playing works with complex textures. Rachmaninoff applied these qualities in music by Chopin, including the [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|B-flat minor Piano Sonata]]. Rachmaninoff's repertoire, excepting his own works, consisted mainly of standard 19th Century virtuoso works plus music by Bach, Beethoven, Borodin, Debussy, Grieg, Liszt, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann and Tchaikovsky.<ref name = "ng714"/>

Rachmaninoff possessed extremely large hands, with which he could easily maneuver through the most complex chordal configurations. His left hand technique was unusually powerful. His playing was marked by ''definition''—where other pianists' playing became blurry-sounding from overuse of the pedal or deficiencies in finger technique, Rachmaninoff's textures were always crystal clear. Only Josef Hofmann and Josef Lhévinne shared this kind of clarity with him.<ref>[[#Virtuosi|Schonberg 1988, ''Virtuosi'']], p. 317.</ref> All three men had [[Anton Rubinstein]] as a model for this kind of playing—Hofmann as a student of Rubinstein's,<ref>Schonberg, ''Pianists'', 384.</ref> Rachmaninoff from hearing his famous series of historical recitals in Moscow while studying with Zverev,{{sfn|von Riesemann|1934|p=49–52}} and Lhevinne from hearing and playing with him.

The two pieces Rachmaninoff singled out for praise from Rubinstein's concerts became cornerstones for his own recital programs. The compositions were [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 23 (Beethoven)|''Appassionata'']] and [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|''Funeral March'' Sonata]]. He may have based his interpretation of the Chopin sonata on Rubinstein's. Rachmaninoff biographer Barrie Martyn points out similarities between written accounts of Rubinstein's interpretation and Rachmaninoff's audio recording of the work.{{sfn|Martyn|1990|pp=368, 403–406}}

As part of his daily warm-up exercises, Rachmaninoff would play the technically difficult Étude in A-flat, Op.&nbsp;1, {{nowrap|No. 2}}, attributed to [[Paul de Schlözer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=146796|title=Jorge Bolet – Encores|publisher=}}</ref>

===Tone===
From those barely moving fingers came an unforced, bronzelike sonority and an accuracy bordering on infallibility.<ref name="SchonbergV315">[[#Virtuosi|Schonberg 1988, ''Virtuosi'']], p. 315.</ref> [[Arthur Rubinstein]] wrote:

<blockquote>He had the secret of the golden, living tone which comes from the heart ... I was always under the spell of his glorious and inimitable tone which could make me forget my uneasiness about his too rapidly fleeting fingers and his exaggerated ''rubatos''. There was always the irresistible sensuous charm, not unlike [[Fritz Kreisler|Kreisler]]'s.<ref>Rubinstein, 1980., 87–89, 468.</ref></blockquote>

Coupled to this tone was a vocal quality not unlike that attributed to Chopin's playing. With Rachmaninoff's extensive operatic experience, he was a great admirer of fine singing. As his records demonstrate, he possessed a tremendous ability to make a musical line sing, no matter how long the notes or how complex the supporting texture, with most of his interpretations taking on a narrative quality. With the stories he told at the keyboard came multiple voices—a [[polyphony|polyphonic]] dialogue, not the least in terms of dynamics. His 1940 recording of his transcription of the song "Daisies" captures this quality extremely well. On the recording, separate musical strands enter as if from various human voices in eloquent conversation. This ability came from an exceptional independence of fingers and hands.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=270}}

===Memory===
Rachmaninoff also possessed an uncanny memory—one that would help put him in good stead when he had to learn the standard piano repertoire as a 45-year-old exile. He could hear a piece of music, even a symphony, then play it back the next day, the next year, or a decade after that. Siloti would give him a long and demanding piece to learn, such as Brahms' ''[[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel]]''. Two days later Rachmaninoff would play it "with complete artistic finish." [[Alexander Goldenweiser (composer)|Alexander Goldenweiser]] said, "Whatever composition was ever mentioned—piano, orchestral, operatic, or other—by a Classical or contemporary composer, if Rachmaninoff had at any time heard it, and most of all if he liked it, he played it as though it were a work he had studied thoroughly."<ref>[[#Composers|Schonberg 1998, ''Composers'']], p, 522.</ref>

===Interpretations===
[[File:Rachmaninoff playing Steinway grand piano.jpg|thumb|left|Rachmaninoff at the piano (1936 or before)]]
Regardless of the music, Rachmaninoff always planned his performances carefully. He based his interpretations on the theory that each piece of music has a "culminating point." Regardless of where that point was or at which dynamic within that piece, the performer had to know how to approach it with absolute calculation and precision; otherwise, the whole construction of the piece could crumble and the piece could become disjointed. This was a practice he learned from Russian bass [[Feodor Chaliapin]], a staunch friend.<ref name="ng714">[[#Norris|Norris]], 714.</ref> Paradoxically, Rachmaninoff often sounded like he was improvising, though he actually was not. While his interpretations were mosaics of tiny details, when those mosaics came together in performance, they might, according to the tempo of the piece being played, fly past at great speed, giving the impression of instant thought.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=268}}

[[File:Second Hungarian Rhapsody.ogg|right|thumb|1919 Rachmaninoff recording of Liszt's 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody for [[Edison Records]].]]
One advantage Rachmaninoff had in this building process over most of his contemporaries was in approaching the pieces he played from the perspective of a composer rather than that of an interpreter. He believed "interpretation demands something of the creative instinct. If you are a composer, you have an affinity with other composers. You can make contact with their imaginations, knowing something of their problems and their ideals. You can give their works ''color''. That is the most important thing for me in my interpretations, ''color''. So you make music live. Without color it is dead."<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Basil|last=Mayne|title=Conversations with Rachmaninoff|journal=Musical Opinion|date=October 1936}}</ref> Nevertheless, Rachmaninoff also possessed a far better sense of structure than many of his contemporaries, such as Hofmann, or the majority of pianists from the previous generation, judging from their respective recordings.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=270}}

A recording which showcases Rachmaninoff's approach is the [[Franz Liszt|Liszt]] Second Polonaise, recorded in 1925. [[Percy Grainger]], who had been influenced by the composer and Liszt specialist [[Ferruccio Busoni]], had himself recorded the same piece a few years earlier. Rachmaninoff's performance is far more taut and concentrated than Grainger's. The Russian's drive and monumental conception bear a considerable difference to the Australian's more delicate perceptions. Grainger's textures are elaborate. Rachmaninoff shows the filigree as essential to the work's structure, not simply decorative.{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=251}}

===Speculations about Marfan syndrome and acromegaly===
Along with his musical gifts, Rachmaninoff possessed physical gifts that may have placed him in good stead as a pianist. These gifts included exceptional height and extremely large hands with a gigantic finger stretch (he could play the chord C E{{flat}} G C G with his left hand). This and Rachmaninoff's slender frame, long limbs, narrow head, prominent ears, and thin nose suggest that he may have had [[Marfan syndrome]], a hereditary disorder of the [[connective tissue]]. This syndrome would have accounted for several minor ailments he suffered all his life, including back pain, arthritis, eye strain, and bruising of the fingertips.,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Young, D.A.B.|journal=British Medical Journal|year=1986 |volume=293|issue=6562|pages=1624–1626|pmc=1351877|title=Rachmaninov and Marfan's syndrome|pmid=3101945|doi=10.1136/bmj.293.6562.1624}}</ref> although others have pointed out that this was more likely because he was playing the piano all day long. This Marfan speculation was proposed by Dr. D. A. B. Young (formerly principal scientist of the [[Wellcome Foundation]]) in a 1986 ''British Medical Journal'' article. Twenty years later, an article in the ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'', by Ramachandran and Aronson differed greatly from Young’s speculation:

:The size of [Rachmaninov’s] hands may have been a manifestation of Marfan's syndrome, their size and slenderness typical of arachnodactyly. However, Rachmaninov did not clearly exhibit any of the other clinical characteristics typical of Marfan's, such as scoliosis, pectus excavatum, and eye or cardiac complications. Nor did he express any of the clinical effects of a Marfan-related syndrome, such as Beal's syndrome (congenital contractural arachnodactyly), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, homocystinuria, Stickler syndrome, or Sphrintzen-Goldberg syndrome. There is no indication that his immediate family had similar hand spans, ruling out familial arachnodactyly. Rachmaninov did not display any signs of digital clubbing or any obvious hypertrophic skin changes associated with pachydermoperiostitis.
:
:Acromegaly is an alternative diagnosis. From photographs of Rachmaninov in the 1920s and his portrait by Konstantin Somov in 1925 (Figure 1), at a time when he was recording his four piano concerti, the coarse facial features of acromegaly are not immediately apparent. However, a case can be made from later photographs...
:
:During a heavy concert schedule in Russia in 1912, he interrupted his schedule because of stiffness in his hands. This may have been due to overuse, although carpal tunnel syndrome or simply swelling and puffiness of the hands associated with acromegaly may have been the cause. In 1942, Rachmaninov made a final revision of his troublesome Fourth Concerto but composed no more new music. A rapidly progressing melanoma forced him to break off his 1942–1943 concert tour after a recital in Knoxville, Tennessee. A little over five weeks later he died in the house he had bought the year before on Elm Drive in Beverly Hills. Melanoma is associated with acromegaly and may have been a final clue to Rachmaninov's diagnosis.

:But then again, perhaps he just had big hands.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Ramachandran, Manoj |author2=Aronson, Jeffrey K. |title=The diagnosis of art: Rachmaninov's hand span|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|year=2006 |volume=99|issue=10|pages=529–530|pmc=1592053|pmid=17066567 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.99.10.529}}</ref>

Contrary to rumors of "six and a half feet," Rachmaninoff’s physical height is documented in repeated (10 November 1918 and 30 October 1924) U.S. Immigration manifests at Ellis Island as 6'-1".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rachmaninoff.org/board/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=496 |title=SVR'S HEIGHT |publisher=Rachmaninoff.org |accessdate=19 January 2014}}</ref> However, conductor Eugene Ormandy (who teamed with Rachmaninoff in many piano and orchestra performances) recalled in 1979: "He [Rachmaninoff] was about six feet-three.

{{See also|Sergei Rachmaninoff Recordings}}

===Phonograph===
Many of Rachmaninoff's recordings are acknowledged classics. Rachmaninoff recorded a selection of piano pieces for [[Edison Records]] on their "[[Edison Disc Records|Diamond Disc]]" records since they claimed the best [[High fidelity|audio fidelity]] in piano recording. [[Thomas Edison]], who was quite deaf,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1608.html|title=Thomas Edison|quote="When Edison was 14, he contracted scarlet fever. The effect of the fever, as well as a blow to the head by an angry train conductor, caused Edison to become completely deaf in his left ear, and 80-percent deaf in the other."|publisher=}}</ref> did not care for Rachmaninoff's playing, or for classical music in general, and referred to him as a "pounder" at their initial meeting.<ref>{{citation | first=George | last=Ziemann| title=Thomas Edison, Intellectual Property and the Recording Industry | date=October 2003 | url =http://www.azoz.com/newsarchive/edison/index.html}}</ref> However, staff at the Edison recording studio in New York City asked Edison to reconsider his dismissive position, resulting in a limited contract for ten released sides. Rachmaninoff recorded on a Lauter concert grand piano, one of the few the company made. He felt his performances varied in quality and requested final approval prior to a commercial release. Edison agreed, but still issued multiple takes, then a common practice in the record industry but especially prevalent at Edison Records, where strict company policy demanded three "perfect" takes of each piece in case of damage in manufacturing or wear to the master tapes. Rachmaninoff and Edison Records were pleased with the released discs and wished to record more, but Edison refused, saying the ten sides were sufficient.

[[File:Rachmaninoff.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] advertisement from March 1921 featuring Rachmaninoff.]]
In 1920, Rachmaninoff signed a contract with the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and with its successor, [[RCA Red Seal|RCA Victor]]. The company was pleased to comply with Rachmaninoff's demands, and proudly advertised him as one of their prominent recording artists. Rachmaninoff continued to record for Victor until 1942, when the [[American Federation of Musicians]] imposed a two-year [[1942–44 musicians' strike|recording ban]] on their members due to strike action.

Particularly renowned are his renditions of Schumann's ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'' and Chopin's ''[[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|Funeral March Sonata]]'', along with many shorter pieces. He recorded all four of his piano concertos with the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], including two versions of the second concerto with [[Leopold Stokowski]] conducting (an acoustical recording in 1924 and a complete electrical recording in 1929), and a world premiere recording of the ''Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'', soon after the first performance (1934) with the Philadelphians under Stokowski. The first, third, and fourth concertos were recorded with [[Eugene Ormandy]] in 1939–41. Rachmaninoff also made three recordings conducting the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]] in his own [[Symphony No. 3 (Rachmaninoff)|Third Symphony]], his symphonic poem ''[[Isle of the Dead (Rachmaninoff)|Isle of the Dead]]'', and his orchestration of ''[[Vocalise (Rachmaninoff)|Vocalise]]''. All of these recordings were reissued by RCA Victor in a 10-CD set "Sergei Rachmaninoff The Complete Recordings" (RCA Victor Gold Seal 09026-61265-2).

In an article for ''Gramophone'', April 1931, Rachmaninoff defended an earlier stated view on the musical value of radio, about which he was sceptical: "the modern gramophone and modern methods of recording are musically superior to wireless transmission in every way".<ref name="Gramophone">[http://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/focus/the-most-significant-of-modern-musical-inventions?page=0,0 Gramophone]. "The most significant of modern musical inventions", Gramophone, April 1931</ref>

===Piano rolls===
[[File:5216-0007-reverse.png|thumb|upright|A Russian Federation commemorative Rachmaninoff coin.]]
Rachmaninoff was also involved in various ways with music on [[piano rolls]]. Several manufacturers, and in particular the Aeolian Company, had published his compositions on perforated music rolls from about 1900 onwards.<ref>"Music for the Pianola and the Aeriol Piano", The Aeolian Company, New York, July 1901.</ref> His sister-in-law, Sofia Satina, remembered him at the family estate at Ivanovka, pedalling gleefully through a set of rolls of his Second Piano Concerto, apparently acquired from a German source,{{sfn|Harrison|2006|p=223}} most probably the Aeolian Company's Berlin subsidiary, the Choralion Company. Aeolian in London created a set of three rolls of this concerto in 1909, which remained in the catalogues of its various successors until the late 1970s.<ref>"Catalogue of Music for the Pianola and Pianola-Piano", The Orchestrelle Company, London, June 1910, and many successive catalogues.</ref>

From 1919 he made 35 piano rolls (12 of which were his own compositions), for the [[American Piano Company|American Piano Company (Ampico)]]'s [[reproducing piano]]. According to the Ampico publicity department, he initially disbelieved that a roll of punched paper could provide an accurate record, so he was invited to listen to a proof copy of his first recording. After the performance, he was quoted as saying ''"Gentlemen—I, Sergei Rachmaninoff, have just heard myself play!"'' For demonstration purposes, he recorded the solo part of his Second Piano Concerto for Ampico, though only the second movement was used publicly and has survived. He continued to record until around 1929, though his last roll, the Chopin Scherzo in B-flat minor, was not published until October 1933.<ref>Obenchain, Elaine.
