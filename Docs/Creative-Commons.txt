'''Creative Commons''' ('''CC''') is an American [[non-profit organization]] devoted to expanding the range of [[creativity|creative]] works available for others to build upon legally and to share.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Creative Commons |date = |accessdate=20 December 2011}}</ref> The organization has released several [[copyright]]-[[license]]s known as [[Creative Commons license]]s free of charge to the public. These licenses allow creators to communicate which rights they reserve, and which rights they [[waive]] for the benefit of recipients or other creators. An easy-to-understand one-page explanation of rights, with associated visual symbols, explains the specifics of each Creative Commons license. Creative Commons licenses do not replace copyright, but are based upon it. They replace individual negotiations for specific rights between copyright owner (licensor) and [[licensee]], which are necessary under an "all rights reserved" copyright management, with a "some rights reserved" management employing standardized licenses for re-use cases where no commercial compensation is sought by the copyright owner. The result is an agile, low-overhead and low-cost copyright-management regime, profiting both copyright owners and licensees. [[Wikipedia]] uses one of these licenses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use |title=Wikimedia Foundation Terms of Use |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>

The organization was founded in 2001 by [[Lawrence Lessig]], [[Hal Abelson]], and [[Eric Eldred]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/about/history|title=Creative Commons: History|accessdate=2011-10-09}}</ref> with the support of [[Center for the Public Domain]]. The first article in a general interest publication about Creative Commons, written by [[Hal Plotkin]], was published in February 2002.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2002/02/11/creatcom.DTL|title=All Hail Creative Commons Stanford professor and author Lawrence Lessig plans a legal insurrection |last=Plotkin |first=Hal |work= |publisher=SFGate.com |accessdate=2011-03-08 |date=11 February 2002}}</ref> The first set of copyright licenses was released in December 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/about/history/|title=History of Creative Commons |accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref> The founding management team that developed the licenses and built the Creative Commons infrastructure as we know it today included [[Molly Shaffer Van Houweling]], Glenn Otis Brown, Neeru Paharia, and Ben Adida.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/3483|title=Creative Commons Announces New Management Team |last=Haughey |first=Matt |date=2002-09-18|publisher=creativecommons.org |accessdate=2013-05-07}}</ref> 

In 2003 the [[Open Content Project]], a 1998 precursor project by [[David A. Wiley]], announced the Creative Commons as successor project and Wiley joined as CC director.<ref>{{cite web||archivedate=2003-08-02|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030802222546/http://opencontent.org/|url=http://opencontent.org/ |title=OpenContent is officially closed.

As of January 2016 there were an estimated 1.1 billion works licensed under the various Creative Commons licenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stateof.creativecommons.org/2015/|title=State of the Commons |accessdate=2016-03-07}}</ref> As of March 2015, [[Flickr]] alone hosts over 306 million Creative Commons licensed photos.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/creativecommons |title=Explore Creative Commons |publisher=Flickr |accessdate=15 March 2015}}</ref> Creative Commons is governed by a board of directors. Their licenses have been embraced by many as a way for creators to take control of how they choose to share their copyrighted works.

Creative Commons has been described as being at the forefront of the [[copyleft]] movement, which seeks to support the building of a richer [[public domain]] by providing an alternative to the automatic "all rights reserved" [[copyright]], and has been dubbed "some rights reserved."<ref>{{cite news| first= Sharee L. | last= Broussard| title= The copyleft movement: creative commons licensing | publisher= Communication Research Trends | url=http://cscc.scu.edu/trends/v26/v26_n3.pdf  | date=September 2007 | accessdate=2015-10-20}}</ref> David Berry and Giles Moss have credited Creative Commons with generating interest in the issue of [[intellectual property]] and contributing to the re-thinking of the role of the "[[commons]]" in the "[[information age]]". Beyond that, Creative Commons has provided "institutional, practical and legal support for individuals and groups wishing to experiment and communicate with culture more freely."<ref>{{cite web|last=Berry |first=David |url=http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/articles/commons_without_commonality/ |title=On the "Creative Commons": a critique of the commons without commonalty |publisher=Free Software Magazine |date=15 July 2005 |accessdate=20 December 2011}}</ref>

Creative Commons attempts to counter what Lawrence Lessig, founder of Creative Commons, considers to be a dominant and increasingly restrictive [[permission culture]]. Lessig describes this as "a culture in which creators get to create only with the permission of the powerful, or of creators from the past".<ref>{{Cite book| first=Lawrence | last=Lessig |url=http://www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf |year=2004 | title=Free Culture | publisher=Penguin Press | location=New York | page=8 |format=PDF| isbn=1-59420-006-8| accessdate=2015-10-20}}</ref> Lessig maintains that modern culture is dominated by traditional content distributors in order to maintain and strengthen their monopolies on cultural products such as popular music and popular cinema, and that Creative Commons can provide alternatives to these restrictions.<ref>{{Cite news| author=Ermert, Monika | title=Germany debuts Creative Commons | work=The Register | date=2004-06-15| url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/06/15/german_creative_commons/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| author=Lessig, Lawrence| year=2006| title=Lawrence Lessig on Creative Commons and the Remix Culture | format=mp3 | work=Talking with Talis | url=http://talk.talis.com/archives/2006/01/lawrence_lessig.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205034639/http://talk.talis.com/archives/2006/01/lawrence_lessig.html | archivedate=2008-02-05 | accessdate=2006-04-07}}</ref>

==Affiliate network==
As of 2015, there are more than 100 affiliates working in over 75 jurisdictions to support and promote CC activities around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC_Affiliate_Network |title=CC Affiliate Network |publisher=Creative Commons |accessdate= 15 March 2015}}</ref>

===South Korea===
'''Creative Commons Korea''' ('''CC Korea''') is the affiliated network of Creative Commons in South Korea. In March 2005, CC Korea was initiated by Jongsoo Yoon (in Korean: 윤종수), a Presiding Judge of Incheon District Court, as a project of Korea Association for Infomedia Law (KAFIL). The major Korean portal sites, including Daum and Naver, have been participating in the use of Creative Commons licences. In January 2009, the Creative Commons Korea Association was consequently founded as a non-profit incorporated association. Since then, CC Korea has been actively promoting the liberal and open culture of creation as well as leading the diffusion of Creative Common in the country.

==Criticism==
All current CC licenses (except the CC0 Public Domain Dedication tool) require attribution, which can be inconvenient for works based on multiple other works.<ref>{{cite web

Critics also worried that the lack of rewards for content producers will dissuade artists from publishing their work, and questioned whether Creative Commons is the [[commons]] that it purports to be.<ref name="Niva Elkin-Koren, Exploring Creative Commons: A Skeptical View of a Worthy Pursuit">{{cite web| first= Niva| last= Elkin-Koren| title= Exploring Creative Commons: A Skeptical View of a Worthy Pursuit | publisher= The Future of the Public Domain (P.

Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig countered that copyright laws have not always offered the strong and seemingly indefinite protection that today's law provides. Rather, the duration of copyright used to be limited to much shorter terms of years, and some works never gained protection because they did not follow the now-abandoned compulsory format.<ref name="Lawrence Lessig, The Creative Commons">{{cite web| first= Lawrence| last= Lessig| title= The Creative Commons | publisher= 65 Mont.

===License proliferation and incompatibility===
[[Mako Hill]] asserted that Creative Commons fails to establish a "base level of freedom" that all Creative Commons licenses must meet, and with which all licensors and users must comply. "By failing to take any firm ethical position and draw any line in the sand, CC is a missed opportunity.... CC has replaced what could have been a call for a world where 'essential rights are unreservable' with the relatively hollow call for 'some rights reserved.{{' "}} He also argued that Creative Commons worsens [[license proliferation]], by providing multiple licenses that are [[license compatibility|incompatible]].<ref name="Mako Hill, Towards a Standard of Freedom">{{cite web

[[Richard Stallman]] of the [[Free Software Foundation|FSF]] stated in 2005 that he couldn’t support Creative Commons as an activity because "it adopted some additional licenses which do not give everyone that minimum freedom", that freedom being "the freedom to share, noncommercially, any published work".<ref>{{cite web

===License misuse===
[[File:CC guidant les contributeurs.jpg|thumb|right|''Creative Commons guiding the contributors''. This image is a derivative work of ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]].]]

Creative Commons is only a service provider for standardized license text, not a party in any agreement. Abusive users can brand the copyrighted works of legitimate copyright holders with Creative Commons licenses and re-upload these works to the internet. No central database of Creative Commons works is controlling all licensed works and the responsibility of the Creative Commons system rests entirely with those using the licences.<ref name="Andrew Orlowski, Tragedy of the Creative Commons" >{{cite web| first= Andrew | last= Orlowski| title= The Tragedy of the Creative Commons| publisher= | url=http://andreworlowski.com/2009/07/16/the-tragedy-of-the-creative-commons/ |date=July 2009}}</ref> This situation is, however, not specific to Creative Commons. All copyright owners must individually defend their rights and no central database of copyrighted works or existing license agreements exists. The [[United States Copyright Office]] does keep a database of all works registered with it, but absence of registration does not imply absence of copyright.

Although Creative Commons offers multiple licenses for different uses, some critics suggested that the licenses still do not address the differences among the media or among the various concerns that different authors have.<ref name="Niva Elkin-Koren, Exploring Creative Commons: A Skeptical View of a Worthy Pursuit" />

Lessig wrote that the point of Creative Commons is to provide a middle ground between two extreme views of copyright protection—one demanding that all rights be controlled, and the other arguing that none should be controlled. Creative Commons provides a third option that allows authors to pick and choose which rights they want to control and which they want to grant to others. The multitude of licenses reflects the multitude of rights that can be passed on to subsequent creators.<ref name="Lawrence Lessig, The Creative Commons" />

===Criticism of the non-commercial license===
[[Erik Möller]] raised concerns about the use of Creative Commons' non-commercial license. Works distributed under the Creative Commons Non-Commercial license are not compatible with many open-content sites, including Wikipedia, which explicitly allow and encourage some commercial uses. Möller explained that "the people who are likely to be hurt by an -NC license are not large corporations, but small publications like weblogs, advertising-funded radio stations, or local newspapers."<ref name="Erik Moller, The Case for Free Use: Reasons Not to Use a Creative Commons -NC License">{{cite web

Lessig responded that the current copyright regime also harms compatibility and that authors can lessen this incompatibility by choosing the least restrictive license.<ref name="Lawrence Lessig, CC in Review: Lawrence Lessig on Important Freedoms">{{cite web| first= Lawrence| last= Lessig| authorlink=Lawrence Lessig| title= CC in Review: Lawrence Lessig on Important Freedoms | publisher= Creative Commons| url=http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/5719 | year=2005 | accessdate=2015-10-20}}</ref> Additionally, the non-commercial license is useful for preventing someone else from capitalizing on an author's work when the author still plans to do so in the future.<ref name="Lawrence Lessig, CC in Review: Lawrence Lessig on Important Freedoms" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/hmdmhdfmhdjmzdtjmzdtzktdkztdjz/commons|title=On Free, and the Differences between Culture and Code|publisher=[[Chaos Communication Congress|23C3 ''Who can you trust?'']]|year=2006|type=video|id=google video docid=7661663613180520595|accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref> The non-commercial licenses have also been criticized for being too vague about which uses count as "commercial" and "non-commercial".<ref>{{cite web

===Personality rights===
In 2007, [[Virgin Mobile Australia]] launched a bus stop advertising campaign which promoted its mobile phone text messaging service using the work of amateur photographers who uploaded their work to photo-sharing site [[Flickr]] using a [[Creative Commons Attribution 2.5|Creative Commons by Attribution]] license. Users licensing their images this way freed their work for use by any other entity, as long as the original creator was attributed credit, without any other compensation being required. Virgin upheld this single restriction by printing a URL, leading to the photographer's Flickr page, on each of their ads. However, one picture depicted 15-year-old Alison Chang posing for a photo at her church's fund-raising carwash, with the superimposed, mocking slogan "Dump Your Pen Friend".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.out-law.com/page-8494 |title=Lawsuit over Virgin Mobile's use of Flickr girl blames Creative Commons |work=Out-law.com |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate=2013-05-23}}</ref><ref name="permission">{{cite news|first=Noam|last=Cohen|title=Use My Photo?

So, while Mr. Wong may have given away his rights as a photographer, he did not, and could not, give away Alison's [[Personality rights|rights]].

On 27 November 2007, Chang filed for a voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit against Creative Commons, focusing their lawsuit against Virgin Mobile.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Grant|title=Lawsuit Against Creative Commons Dropped|work=[[PC World]]|date=2007-12-01|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/140189/lawsuit_against_creative_commons_dropped.html|accessdate=2008-05-25}}</ref> The case was thrown out of court due to lack of jurisdiction and subsequently Virgin Mobile did not incur any damages towards the defendant.<ref>{{cite news|last=LaVine|first=Lindsay|title=Use Photos in Advertisements?
