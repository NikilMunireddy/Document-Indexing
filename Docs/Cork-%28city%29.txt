'''Cork''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɔr|k}} {{Irish place name|Corcaigh|no_translate=yes}}, {{IPA-ga|ˈkoɾkɪɟ|pron}}, from ''corcach'', meaning "marsh") is a [[City status in Ireland|city in Ireland]], located in the [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]], in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]]. It has a population of 119,230,<ref>[http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/saveselections.asp Census of Ireland, 2011.] ''[[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|Central Statistics Office]]'', "Actual and Percentage Change in Population by Aggregate Town or Rural Area, Sex, Province County or City, Statistical Indicator and Census Year"</ref> and is the [[List of towns in the Republic of Ireland by population|second largest]] city in the state and the [[City status in Ireland|third most populous]] on the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]].

The city is built on the [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]] which splits into two channels at the western end of the city; the city centre is divided by these channels. They reconverge at the eastern end where the [[quay]]s and [[Dock (maritime)|docks]] along the river banks lead outwards towards [[Mahon, Cork|Lough Mahon]] and [[Cork Harbour]], one of the world's largest natural harbours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/tv/theharbour/abouttheshow.html |title=RTÉ Television – The Harbour |publisher=Rte.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmrc.ie/projects/cork-harbour-birds-atlas.html |title=Coastal & Marine Resources Centre – Cork Harbour Marine Life Research Project Report |publisher=Cmrc.ucc.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>

Cork was originally a monastic settlement, reputedly founded by [[Saint Finbarr]] in the 6th century.<ref>{{cite book

Routledge, 2013, p. 69</ref> The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking ''longphort'', with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Michael A.

The city's charter was granted by [[King John of England|Prince John]], as [[Lord of Ireland]], in 1185.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Council " Charters|url=http://www.corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/charters/|publisher=Cork City Council|accessdate=19 August 2012}}</ref> The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkcity.ie/aboutcork/historyofcork/thewallsofcork/ |title=Cork City Council website – History – Walls of Cork |publisher=Corkcity.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile [[Gaels|Gaelic]] countryside and cut off from the English government in [[the Pale]] around [[Dublin]]. Neighbouring Gaelic and [[Hiberno-Norman]] lords extorted "Black Rent" from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the [[Barony of Cork City]]; it now takes in much of the neighbouring [[Barony of Cork]]. Together, these [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] are located between the [[Barony of Barrymore]] to the east, [[Muskerry East]] to the west and Kerrycurrihy to the south.

The city's municipal government was dominated by about 12–15 merchant families, whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental Europe — in particular the export of wool and hides and the import of salt, iron and wine.
The medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people. It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the [[Black Death]] arrived in the town. In 1491, Cork played a part in the English [[Wars of the Roses]] when [[Perkin Warbeck]] a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow [[Henry VII of England]]. The then mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed.
The title of [[Lord Mayor of Cork|Mayor of Cork]] was established by [[royal charter]] in 1318, and the title was changed to ''Lord Mayor'' in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent Mayor by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] on her [[Royal visit]] to the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/charters/ |title=Charters issued to Cork city |publisher=Cork City Council |accessdate=19 October 2010 }}</ref>

[[File:Patrick Street Cork2.jpg|thumb|Patrick Street c.1890–1900.]]
Since the nineteenth century, Cork had been a strongly [[Irish nationalist]] city, with widespread support for [[Third Home Rule Act|Irish Home Rule]] and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], but from 1910 stood firmly behind [[William O'Brien]]'s dissident [[All-for-Ireland League|All-for-Ireland Party]]. O'Brien published a third local newspaper, the [[Cork Free Press]].

In the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], the centre of Cork was burnt down by the British [[Black and Tans]],<ref name="burning">{{cite web|url=http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/history/historyofcorkcity/early20thcentury/theburningofcork/ |title=Cork City Library – History of Cork – The Burning of Cork |publisher=Corkpastandpresent.ie |date=11 December 1920 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> and the city saw fierce fighting between Irish guerrillas and UK forces. During the [[Irish Civil War]], Cork was for a time held by anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] forces, until it was retaken by the pro-Treaty [[Irish Army|National Army]] in an attack from the sea.

==Climate==
The climate of Cork, like the rest of Ireland, is mild and changeable with abundant rainfall and a lack of temperature extremes. Cork lies in plant [[Hardiness zone]]
9b. [[Met Éireann]] maintains a climatological weather station at [[Cork Airport]],<ref name="met2003">{{cite web|url=http://www.met.ie/publications/met_ar2003.pdf |title=Met Éireann – Annual Report 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> a few kilometres south of the city. It should be noted that the airport is at an altitude of {{convert|151|m|ft}} and temperatures can often differ by a few degrees between the airport and the city itself. There are also smaller synoptic weather stations at [[University College Cork|UCC]] and Clover Hill.<ref name="met2003"/>

Temperatures below {{convert|0|°C|°F}} or above {{convert|25|°C|°F}} are rare. Cork Airport records an average of {{convert|1227.9|mm|ft}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] annually, most of which is rain.<ref name="met30">{{cite web|url=http://www.met.ie/climate/corkairport.asp |title=Met Éireann – The Irish Weather Service – 30 Year Averages – Cork Airport |publisher=Met.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The airport records an average of 7 days of hail and 11 days of snow or sleet a year; though it only records lying snow for 2 days of the year. The low altitude of the city, and moderating influences of the harbour, mean that lying snow very rarely occurs in the city itself. There are on average 204 "rainy" days a year (over {{convert|0.2|mm|in}} of rainfall), of which there are 73 days with "heavy rain" (over {{convert|5|mm|in}}).<ref name="met30"/> Cork is also a generally foggy city, with an average of 97 days of fog a year, most common during mornings and during winter. Despite this, however, Cork is also one of Ireland's sunniest cities, with an average of 3.9 hours of sunshine every day and only having 67 days where there is no "recordable sunshine", mostly during and around winter.<ref name="met30"/>

Cork has been culturally diverse for many years, from Huguenot communities in the 17th century, through to Eastern European communities and a smaller numbers from African and Asian nations in the 20th and 21st centuries.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hayes |first=Brian |url=http://corkindependent.com/stories/item/4181/2011-35/Cork%E2%80%99s-diversity-a-cause-for-celebration |title=Cork's diversity a cause for celebration – News |publisher=Cork Independent |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> This is reflected in the multi-cultural restaurants and shops, including specialist shops for East-European or Middle-Eastern food, Chinese and Thai restaurants, French patisseries, Indian buffets, and Middle Eastern kebab houses. Cork saw some Jewish immigration from Lithuania and Russia in the late 19th century. Jewish citizens such as [[Gerald Goldberg]] (several times Lord Mayor), [[David Marcus]] (novelist) and [[Louis Marcus]] (documentary maker) played notable roles in 20th century Cork. Today, the Jewish community is relatively small in population, although the city still has a Jewish quarter and synagogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkhebrewcongregation.com |title=Information about the Jewish community in Cork |publisher=Corkhebrewcongregation.com |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> Cork also features various Christian churches, as well as a mosque. Some Catholic masses around the city are said in [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and other languages,<ref>{{cite web|author=Ruth Egan |url=http://www.corkandross.org/html/socialservices/immigration.jsp#polish |title=– Mass Times for Polish Community in Diocese of Cork and Ross |publisher=Corkandross.org |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> in addition to the traditional Latin and local Irish<ref>Mass noticeboard, Church of Saints Peter and Paul, Paul Street, Cork</ref> and English language services.

More recent additions to the arts infrastructure include modern additions to Cork Opera House and the [[Crawford Municipal Art Gallery]]. The [[Lewis Glucksman Gallery]] opened in the Autumn of 2004 at UCC, was nominated for the [[Stirling Prize]] in the United Kingdom, and the building of a new €60&nbsp;million School of Music was completed in September 2007.

Cork was the [[European Capital of Culture]] for 2005, and in 2009 was included in the [[Lonely Planet]]'s top 10 "Best in Travel 2010". The guide described Cork as being "at the top of its game: sophisticated, vibrant and diverse".<ref>{{cite news | title = Cork enters 'Lonely Planet' guide as top 10 place to visit | publisher = Irish Times | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/1103/1224257963102.html | accessdate = 9 February 2010 | date=11 November 2009}}</ref>

There is a rivalry between Cork and Dublin, similar to the rivalry between London and Manchester, Sydney and Melbourne or Madrid and Barcelona. Some Corkonians view themselves as different from the rest of Ireland, and refer to themselves as "The Rebels"; the county is known as the [[Rebel County]]. This view has in recent years manifested itself in humorous references to the ''Real Capital'' and the sale of T-shirts with light-hearted banners celebrating ''The People's Republic of Cork''.

===Food===
The city has many local traditions in food, including ''[[crubeens]]'', ''[[tripe]] and [[drisheen]]''. Cork's [[English Market]] sells locally produced foods, including fresh fish, meats, fruit and vegetables, eggs and artisan cheeses and breads. During certain city festivals, food stalls are also sometimes erected on city streets such as [[St. Patrick's Street]] or [[Grand Parade, Cork|Grand Parade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkmidsummer.com/2010/events/feasta |title=Cork Midsummer Festival 2010 – Feasta Food Fair |publisher=Corkmidsummer.com |date=27 June 2010 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>

===Accent===
The Cork accent, part of the Southwest dialect of [[Hiberno-English]], displays various features which set it apart from other accents in Ireland. Patterns of tone and intonation often rise and fall, with the overall tone tending to be more high-pitched than other Irish accents. English spoken in Cork has a number of dialect words that are peculiar to the city and environs. Like standard [[Hiberno-English]], some of these words originate from the Irish language, but others through other languages Cork's inhabitants encountered at home and abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dialectblog.com/2011/02/21/dialect-profile-the-cork-accent/ |title=Dialect Profile: The Cork Accent |publisher=Dialect Blog |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> The Cork accent displays varying degrees of [[rhoticity in English|rhoticity]], usually depending on the social-class of the speaker.

Cork has also been home to [[pirate radio]] stations, including South Coast Radio and ERI in the 1980s. Today some small pirates stations remain. A number of neighbouring counties radio stations can be heard in parts of Cork City including [[Radio Kerry]] at 97.0 and [[WLR FM]] on 95.1.

[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ Cork]] has television and radio studios, and production facilities at its centre in Father Matthew Street in the city centre.

===Print===
Cork is home to one of Ireland's main national newspapers, the ''[[Irish Examiner]]'' (formerly the ''Cork Examiner''). It also prints the ''[[Evening Echo]]'', which for decades has been connected to the Echo Boys, who were poor and often homeless children who sold the newspaper. Today, the shouts of the vendors selling the Echo can still be heard in various parts of the city centre. One of the biggest free newspapers in the city is the ''[[Cork Independent (newspaper)|Cork Independent]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corkindependent.com/|title=Cork Independent|work=Cork Independent}}</ref> The city's University publishes the ''UCC Express''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegenews.ie/index.php/advertise-in-the-ucc-express/ |title=Advertise in The UCC Express |publisher=CollegeNews.ie |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> and ''Motley'' magazine.<ref>uccmotley.ie</ref>

Cork features architecturally notable buildings originating from the Medieval to Modern periods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enfo.ie/leaflets/bs31.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517064035/http://www.enfo.ie/leaflets/bs31.htm|title=Medieval Cork|archivedate=17 May 2008|work=enfo.ie}}</ref> The only notable remnant of the Medieval era is the [[Red Abbey, Cork|Red Abbey]]. There are two cathedrals in the city; [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Cork|St. Mary's Cathedral]] and [[Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral]]. St Mary's Cathedral, often referred to as the North Cathedral, is the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the city and was begun in 1808. Its distinctive tower was added in the 1860s. St Fin Barre's Cathedral serves the Protestant faith and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is built on the foundations of an earlier cathedral. Work began in 1862 and ended in 1879 under the direction of architect [[William Burges]].

[[St. Patrick's Street]], the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s, is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare. It is dominated at its north end by the landmark statue of [[Theobald Mathew (temperence reformer)|Father Mathew]]. The reason for its curved shape is that it originally was a channel of the [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]] that was built over on arches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/places/stpatricksstreet/historicoutline/ |title=Cork City Library – History of Cork – St Patrick's Street – Historic Outline |publisher=Corkpastandpresent.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The General Post Office, with its limestone façade, is on Oliver Plunkett Street, on the site of the Theatre Royal which was built in 1760 and burned down in 1840. The English circus proprietor [[Pablo Fanque]] rebuilt an amphitheatre on the spot in 1850, which was subsequently transformed into a theatre and then into the present General Post Office in 1877.<ref>{{cite book|author=J.W.

The [[Grand Parade, Cork|Grand Parade]] is a tree-lined avenue, home to offices, shops and financial institutions. The old financial centre is the South Mall, with several banks whose interior derive from the 19th century, such as the [[Allied Irish Bank]]'s which was once an exchange.

[[File:CorkCountyHall.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Cork County Hall]] was Ireland's tallest building for a time and is located on the western side of the city]]
Many of the city's buildings are in the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian style]], although there are a number of examples of modern landmark structures, such as [[Cork County Hall|County Hall]] tower, which was, at one time the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in Ireland#Storeyed buildings|tallest building in Ireland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.corkcoco.ie/co/web/Cork%20County%20Council/About%20Us/County%20Hall |title=Cork County Council – About the "County Hall" |publisher=Corkcoco.ie |date=12 June 1981 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> until being superseded by another Cork City building: [[The Elysian]]. Outside the County Hall is the landmark sculpture of two men, known locally as 'Cha and Miah'. Across the river from County Hall is Ireland's longest building; built in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, Our Lady's Psychiatric Hospital has now been renovated and converted into a residential housing complex called Atkins Hall, after its architect [[William Atkins (architect)|William Atkins]].

Cork's most famous building is the [[Church of St Anne (Shandon)|church tower of Shandon]], which dominates the North side of the city. It is widely regarded as the symbol of the city. The North and East sides are faced in red sandstone, and the West and South sides are clad in the predominant stone of the region, white limestone. At the top sits a weather vane in the form of an eleven-foot salmon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shandonbells.ie/ |title=Church of St. Anne Shandon |publisher=Shandonbells.ie |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>

[[Cork City Hall]], another notable building of limestone, replaced the previous one which was destroyed by the [[Black and Tans]] during the War of Independence in an event known as the "[[The Burning of Cork|Burning of Cork]]".<ref name="burning"/> The cost of this new building was provided by the UK Government in the 1930s as a gesture of reconciliation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/cityhalls/cork-cityhall.html |title=Cork City Hall |publisher=City Mayors |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref>

[[File:St finbarres cathedral1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Saint Finbarre's Cathedral|St Finbarre's Cathedral]]]]
Other notable places include [[Elizabeth Fort]], the [[Cork Opera House]], Christ Church on South Main Street (now the Triskel Arts Centre and original site of early Hiberno-Norse church), St Mary's Dominican Church on Popes Quay and Fitzgerald's Park to the west of the city, which contains the [[Cork Public Museum]]. Other popular tourist attractions include the grounds of [[University College Cork]], through which the River Lee flows, the angling lake known as [[The Lough, Cork|The Lough]], the Women's Gaol at Sundays Well (now a heritage centre) and the [[English Market]]. This covered market traces its origins back to 1610, and the present building dates from 1786.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverireland.ie/DI/resultsengine/IndividualResultTCS.aspx?touristItemID=45349&type=Activity&LocationID=6&SearchString=english+mar&FromDate=&ToDate=&SearchByDate=0&CategoryID=931&LocationName=All+towns&CountyID=6&Radius=1000&rbSelect=&SortBy=1&SubCategoryID=931|title=English Market - Activities - Shopping - Food Markets - All Ireland - Republic of Ireland - Cork - Cork City - Discover Ireland|author=Website design and development Tibus|work=discoverireland.ie}}</ref>

Up until April 2009, there were also two large commercial breweries in the city. The [[Beamish and Crawford]] on South Main Street closed in April 2009 and transferred production to the [[Murphy's Irish Stout|Murphy's]] brewery in Lady's Well. This brewery also produces Heineken for the Irish market. There is also the Franciscan Well brewery, serving the local market with a variety of lagers, ales and stouts. In May 2008 it was awarded as the "Best Microbrewery in Ireland" by Food and Wine Magazine.

===Road===
[[File:Patricks bridge cork.jpg|thumb|right|St. Patrick's Bridge]]
The Cork area has seen improvements in road infrastructure in recent years. For example, the Cork South Link [[dual carriageway]] was built in the early 1980s, to link the Kinsale Road roundabout with the city centre. Shortly afterwards, the first sections of the South Ring dual carriageway were opened. Work continued through the 1990s on extending the [[N25 road (Ireland)|N25]] South Ring Road, with the opening of the [[Jack Lynch Tunnel]] under the [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]] being a significant addition. The Kinsale Road flyover opened in August 2006 to remove a bottleneck for traffic heading to Cork Airport or Killarney. Other projects completed at this time include the [[N20 road|N20]] Blackpool bypass and the N20 Cork to Mallow road projects. The [[N22 road|N22]] Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass, which links to the Western end of the Cork Southern Ring road was opened in September 2004. City Centre road improvements include the Patrick Street project - which reconstructed the street with a pedestrian focus. The [[M8 motorway (Ireland)|M8 motorway]] links Cork with [[Dublin]].

Cork City Council supports a [[car sharing]] scheme operated by Mendes GoCar in partnership with cambio Mobility Services. There are several bases in Cork.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.gocar.ie/cms/carsharing/en/4/stdws_info/stationen/region/571.html |title=GoBases – Cork |publisher=GoCar CarSharing |accessdate=25 November 2010 }}</ref>

From 2012, cycle paths and bike stands were added in a number of areas, making the city more cycle friendly.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cork City Cycling Strategy |publisher=Cork City Council |url=http://www.corkcity.ie/services/roadstransportation/trafficdivision/cycling/filedownload,2419,en.htm |accessdate=28 July 2013 }}</ref> Subsequently, in 2014, a [[bicycle sharing system|public bicycle rental scheme]] was launched. The scheme is operated by An Rothar Nua on behalf of the [[National Transport Authority]], with funding supplemented by an advertising sponsor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galwaycity.ie/news/131/59/The-Coca-Cola-Zero-Bikes-are-Coming-to-Galway-Cork-and-Limerick-Launch-Dates-Announced/|title=Galway City Council - Latest News|work=galwaycity.ie}}</ref>

===Rail===

====Railway and tramway heritage====
Cork was one of the most rail-oriented cities in Ireland, featuring eight stations at various times. The main route, still much the same today, is from [[Dublin Heuston]]. Originally terminating on the city's outskirts at [[Blackpool, Cork|Blackpool]], the route now reaches the city centre [[terminal station|terminus]] of [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent Station]] via Glanmire tunnel. Now a through station, the line through Kent connects the towns  of [[Cobh]] and [[Midleton]] east of the city. This also connected to the seaside town of [[Youghal]], until the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Other rail routes terminating or traversing Cork city were the ''[[Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway]]'', a line to [[Macroom]], the [[Cork and Muskerry Light Railway]] to [[Blarney]], [[Coachford]] and [[Donoughmore]], as well as the [[Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway]] connecting [[Bantry]], [[Skibbereen]], [[Clonakilty]] and many other [[West Cork]] towns. West Cork trains terminated at Albert Quay, across the river from Kent Station (though an on-street rail system connected the two for rolling stock and cargo movement).

Within the city there have been two tram networks in operation. A proposal to develop a horse-drawn tram (linking the city's railway termini) was made by American [[George Francis Train]] in the 1860s, and implemented in 1872 by the Cork Tramway Company. However, the company ceased trading in 1875 after Cork Corporation refused permission to extend the line, mainly because of objections from cab operators to the type of tracks which – although they were laid to the Irish national railway gauge of 5&nbsp;ft 3in – protruded from the road surface.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In December 1898, the [[Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company]] began operating on the Blackpool–Douglas, Summerhill–Sunday's Well and [[Tivoli, Cork|Tivoli]]–Blackrock routes. Increased usage of cars and buses in the 1920s led to a reduction in the use of trams, which discontinued operations permanently on 30 September 1931.

Plans to build a [[Luas]]-type light rail system in the city have been put on hold due to [[2008-2013 Irish banking crisis|2008 Irish economic crisis]], and sufficient funding is not expected to be available until at least 2017.<ref>[http://corkpolitics.ie/wp/?p=8470 Cork Luas plan derailed]. Corkpolitics.ie (12 October 2011). Retrieved on 23 July 2013.</ref>

====Current routes====
Cork's [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent Station]] is the main railway station in the city. From here, services run to destinations all over Ireland. The main line from Cork to [[Dublin Heuston|Dublin]], has hourly departures on the half-hour from Cork. InterCity services are also available to [[Killarney railway station|Kilarney]] and [[Tralee railway station|Tralee]], and to [[Limerick railway station|Limerick]], [[Ennis railway station|Ennis]], [[Athenry railway station|Athenry]] and [[Galway railway station|Galway]] (via [[Limerick Junction]] and the Limerick to Galway railway line)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=119&n=147|title=Timetables|work=Irish Rail}}</ref>

Cork is also linked from [[Limerick Junction]] with connections to [[Clonmel railway station|Clonmel]] and [[Waterford railway station|Waterford]].

The [[Cork Suburban Rail]] system also departs from [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent Station]] and provides connections to parts of [[Metropolitan Cork]]. Stations include [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]], [[Mallow, County Cork|Mallow]], [[Midleton]], [[Fota Island|Fota]] and [[Cobh]]. In July 2009 the [[Glounthaune railway station|Glounthaune]] to [[Midleton railway station|Midleton]] line was reopened, with new stations at [[Carrigtwohill railway station|Carrigtwohill]] and [[Midleton railway station|Midleton]] (with future stations planned for [[Kilbarry railway station|Kilbarry]], [[Monard railway station|Monard]], [[Carrigtwohill West railway station|Carrigtwohill West]] and [[Blarney railway station|Blarney]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0730/rail.html |title=RTÉ News: Service begins on Cork-Midleton line |publisher=Rte.ie |date=30 July 2009 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> Little Island Railway Station serves Cork's Eastern Suburbs, while Kilbarry Railway Station is planned to serve the Northern Suburbs.
