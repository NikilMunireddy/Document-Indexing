==Controversies==
Idolator has had several moments of controversy, including one that was initiated by a post made by the blog that claimed that a post made by [[Wired News]] made several predictions that Idolator believed were widely inaccurate.<ref>{{cite web |accessdate=2010-03-22 |url=http://www.wired.com/listening_post/2008/10/is-listening-po/ |title=Nerd Beef! Idolator vs. Listening Post |publisher=Wired News |date=2008-10-27 |author=Thill, Scott }}</ref> The blog also took advantage of controversy surrounding the [[Pazz & Jop]] critics' poll by ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in November 2006.<ref>{{cite news |accessdate=2010-03-22 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/arts/music/30idol.html |title=Meaty, Beaty, Big and Bloggy: An Online Poll Covets the Territory Once Owned by Pazz & Jop  |work=The New York Times |date=2006-11-30 |author=Sisario, Ben }}</ref>
