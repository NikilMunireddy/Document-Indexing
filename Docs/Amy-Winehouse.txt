==Musical career==

===Early career===
After toying around with her brother Alex's guitar, Winehouse bought her own when she was 14 and began writing music a year later. Soon after, she began working for a living, including, at one time, as an entertainment journalist for the [[World Entertainment News Network]], in addition to singing with local group the Bolsha Band.<ref name="DD"/><ref>Winehouse, Amy. {{Wayback|title= Amy Winehouse – Interview |df= y |date= 20080215071733 |url= http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Amy_Winehouse.php}}.

When he asked who the singer was, the manager told him he was not allowed to say. Having decided that he wanted to sign her, it took several months of asking around for Beese to eventually discover who the singer was. However, Winehouse had already recorded a number of songs and signed a publishing deal with EMI by this time. Incidentally, she formed a working relationship with producer [[Salaam Remi]] through these record publishers.<ref name="HQ"/>

Beese introduced Winehouse to his boss, Nick Gatfield, and the Island head shared his enthusiasm in signing the young artist. Winehouse was signed to Island, as rival interest in Winehouse had started to build to include representatives of EMI and Virgin starting to make moves. Beese told ''[[HitQuarters]]'' that he felt the reason behind the excitement, over an artist who was an atypical pop star for the time, was due to a backlash against reality TV music shows, which included audiences starved for fresh, genuine young talent.<ref name="HQ"/>

===2003–05: Debut album ''Frank''===
[[File:Amy Winehouse 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|Winehouse performing live in July 2004]]
Winehouse's debut album, ''[[Frank (Amy Winehouse album)|Frank]]'', was released on 20 October 2003.

After the release of the album, Winehouse commented that she was "only 80 percent behind [the] album" because Island Records had overruled her preferences for the songs and mixes to be included.<ref name="C&D"/> Further singles from the album were "[[Take the Box]]," "[[In My Bed (Amy Winehouse song)|In My Bed]]"/"[[You Sent Me Flying]]" and "[[Fuck Me Pumps|Pumps]]"/"[[Help Yourself (Amy Winehouse song)|Help Yourself]]."

===2006–07: international success, ''Back to Black'' and touring===

These were some of the first new songs played on the radio after the release of "Pumps" and both were slated to appear on her second album.

When interviewed by [[Jon Stewart]] on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on 29 September 2011, Bennett stated that in hindsight, he believed Amy:
::was in trouble at that time because she had a couple of engagements that she didn't keep up. But what people didn't realize at that time, that she really knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end. . . . It was such a sad thing because . . . she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer. . . . She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer.

''[[The New York Times]]'' style reporter, Guy Trebay, discussed the multiplicity of influences on Winehouse's style after her death. Trebay noted, "her stylish husband, Blake Fielder-Civil, may have influenced her look." Additionally, Trebay observed:
:She was a 5-foot-3 almanac of visual reference, most famously to Ronnie Spector of the Ronettes, but also to the white British soul singer [[Mari Wilson]], less famous for her sound than her beehive; to the punk god [[Johnny Thunders]]...; to the fierce [[Council house|council-house]] chicks...

Former ''Rolling Stone'' editor Joe Levy, who had put her on the magazine's cover, broke her look down this way:
:Just as her best music drew on sampling — assembling sonic licks and stylistic fragments borrowed from [[Motown]], [[Stax Museum of American Soul Music|Stax]], [[Punk rock|punk]] and early [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] — her personal style was also a knowing [[collage]]. There was a certain moment in the '90s when, if you were headed downtown and turned left, every girl looked like [[Bettie Page]]. But they did not do what Winehouse did, mixing [[Bettie Page]] with [[Brigitte Bardot]] and adding that little bit of Ronnie Spector.<ref>Trebay, Guy (27 July 2011). {{Wayback|title= A Bad Girl With a Touch of Genius |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/28/fashion/amy-winehouse-bad-girl-with-a-touch-of-genius.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1 |date= 20120306124020 |df= y}}.

Winehouse's [[wikt:dichotomous|dichotomous]] public image of critical and commercial success versus personal turmoil proved to be controversial. The ''[[New Statesman]]'' called Winehouse "a filthy-mouthed, down-to-earth [[diva]],"<ref name="NS">{{cite journal|first= Jude |last= Rogers |title= Year of the woman |magazine= New Statesman |volume= 135 |issue= 4822 |pages= 36–38 |date= 11 December 2006}}</ref> while ''[[Newsweek]]'' called her "a perfect storm of sex kitten, raw talent and poor impulse control."<ref>{{cite journal|first= Joshua |last= Alston |title= Soul on Ice, And a Twist |magazine= Newsweek |volume= 149 |issue= 11 |page= 60 |date= 12 March 2007}}</ref> Karen Heller with ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' summarised the maelstrom this way:

By 2008, her continued drug problems threatened her career. Even as Nick Gatfield, the president of [[Island Records]], toyed with the idea of releasing Winehouse "to deal with her problems," he remarked on her talent, saying, "It's a reflection of her status [in the U.S.] that when you flick through the TV coverage [of the Grammys] it's her image they use."<ref name="jan24"/> Post-Grammys, some questioned whether Winehouse should have been honoured with the awards given her recent personal and drug problems,<ref>{{cite news|first= Steve |last= Jones |first2= Brian |last2= Mansfield |authorlink2= Brian Mansfield |title= Winehouse and West: Big night |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |date= 11 February 2008 |accessdate= 15 February 2008 |url= http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/awards/grammys/2008-02-11-winehouse-west_N.htm}}</ref><ref>{{Wayback|title= Winehouse wins big |url= http://media.www.hofstrachronicle.com/media/storage/paper222/news/2008/02/14/EditorialopEd/Winehouse.Wins.Big-3211858.shtml |date= 20081207124833 |df= y}}.

It has been argued that Winehouse became a staple in popularity polls not because of her musical contributions but because of her lifestyle. In January 2008, her record label stated they believed the extensive media coverage she had received increased record sales.<ref>Colothan, Scott (31 January 2008). {{Wayback|title= Amy Winehouse's Label Thank Media Frenzy For Record Sales |url= http://www.gigwise.com/news/40444/amy-winehouses-label-thank-media-frenzy-for-record-sales |date= 20141129044825 |df= y}}.

==Death==

Winehouse's bodyguard said that he arrived at her residence three days before her death and felt she was somewhat intoxicated. He observed moderate drinking over the next few days. He observed her "laughing, listening to music and watching TV at 2 a.m. the day of her death". According to the bodyguard, at 10 a.m. he observed her lying on her bed and tried unsuccessfully to rouse her. This did not raise much suspicion because she usually slept late after a night out. According to the bodyguard, shortly after 3 p.m., he checked on her again and observed her lying in the same position as before, leading to a further check, in which he concluded that she was not breathing and had no pulse. He said he subsequently called emergency services.<ref name="coronor"/>
