'''Alternative rock''' (also called '''alternative music''', '''alt-rock''' or simply '''alternative''') is a genre of [[rock music]] that emerged from the [[independent music]] underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word "alternative" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, [[DIY ethic|D.I.Y.]] ethos of [[punk rock]], which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music.<ref name="altguitar">di Perna, Alan. "Brave Noise—The History of Alternative Rock Guitar". ''[[Guitar World]]''. December 1995.</ref> At times, "alternative" has been used as a catch-all description for music from [[Underground music|underground]] rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as [[New wave music|new wave]], and [[post-punk]]).

Alternative rock is a broad umbrella term consisting of music that differs greatly in terms of its sound, its social context, and its regional roots. By the end of the 1980s magazines and [[zine]]s, [[college radio]] airplay, and [[word of mouth]] had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as [[gothic rock]], [[jangle pop]], [[noise pop]], [[indie rock]], [[indie pop]], [[grunge]], [[industrial rock]], [[alternative hip hop]], and [[rap rock]]. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands representing them, such as [[Hüsker Dü]] and [[R.E.M.]], had even signed to [[major labels]]. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to [[independent label]]s and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and the popularity of the [[grunge]] and [[Britpop]] movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful.

By the end of the decade, alternative rock's mainstream prominence declined due to a number of events that caused grunge and Britpop to fade and led to the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival. Nevertheless, post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, with the commercial success of [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Matchbox Twenty]]; [[Radiohead]]'s critical acclaim, and the success of some [[post-Britpop]] groups like [[Coldplay]]. [[Emo]] attracted attention in the larger alternative rock world, and the term was applied to a variety of artists, including multi-platinum acts. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several alternative rock bands emerged, including [[The White Stripes]], [[The Strokes]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], and [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]], that drew from post-punk and new wave. Post-punk revival artists such as [[Modest Mouse]] and [[The Killers]] had commercial success in the early and mid 2000s.

==Origin of term==
Before the term ''alternative rock'' came into common usage around 1990, the sort of music to which it refers was known by a variety of terms.<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 446.</ref> In 1979, [[Terry Tolkin]] used the term ''Alternative Music'' to describe the groups he was writing about.<ref>Azerrad (2001).</ref> In 1979 Dallas radio station [[KBFB|KZEW]] had a late night [[New wave music|new wave]] show entitled "Rock and Roll Alternative".<ref>"Are We Not New Wave Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s by Theo Cateforis University of Michigan Press 2011 p. 38 ISBN 9780472115556</ref>  "[[College rock]]" was used in the United States to describe the music during the 1980s due to its links to the [[Campus radio|college radio]] circuit and the tastes of college students.<ref name="Reynolds391">Reynolds, p. 391</ref> In the United Kingdom, dozens of small [[DIY ethic|do it yourself]] record labels emerged as a result of the [[punk subculture]]. According to the founder of one of these labels, [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]], ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazines published charts based on small record stores called "Alternative Charts". The first national chart based on distribution called the [[UK Indie Chart|Indie Chart]] was published in January 1980; it immediately succeeded in its aim to help these labels. At the time, the term ''indie'' was used literally to describe independently distributed records.<ref>Stanley, Bob. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/jul/31/indie-chart-rise-again "Will the indie chart rise again?"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. July 31, 2009. Retrieved July 20, 2012.</ref> By 1985, ''indie'' had come to mean a particular genre, or group of subgenres, rather than simply distribution status.<ref name="Reynolds391" />

The use of the term ''alternative'' to describe rock music originated around the mid-1980s;<ref>Thompson, Dave. "Introduction". ''Third Ear: Alternative Rock''. San Francisco: Miller Freeman, 2000. p. viii.</ref> at the time, the common music industry terms for cutting-edge music were ''[[Post-punk#History|new music]]'' and ''[[Postmodern music|post modern]]'', respectively indicating freshness and a tendency to re contextualize sounds of the past.<ref name="altguitar"/><ref>Reynolds, p. 338.</ref> Individuals who worked as DJs and promoters during the 1980s claim the term originates from American [[FM radio]] of the 1970s, which served as a progressive alternative to [[top 40]] [[radio format]]s by featuring longer songs and giving DJs more freedom in song selection. According to one former DJ and promoter, "Somehow this term 'alternative' got rediscovered and heisted by [[Campus radio|college radio]] people during the 80s who applied it to new post-punk, indie, or underground-whatever music".<ref>Mullen, Brendan. ''Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane's Addiction''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2005. p. 19. ISBN 0-306-81347-5.</ref> At first the term referred to intentionally non–mainstream rock acts that were not influenced by "heavy metal ballads, rarefied new wave" and "high-energy dance anthems".<ref name=1997Definition>[[Neil Strauss|Strauss, Neil]]. [http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/02/arts/forget-pearl-jam-alternative-rock-lives.html "Forget Pearl Jam. Alternative Rock Lives"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. March 2, 1997. Retrieved July 20, 2012.</ref> Usage of the term would broaden to include [[New wave music|new wave]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[punk rock]], [[post-punk]], and occasionally "[[college rock|college]]"/"[[Indie rock|indie]]" rock, all found on the American "commercial alternative" radio stations of the time such as [[Los Angeles]]' [[KROQ-FM]]. The use of ''alternative'' gained further exposure due to the success of [[Lollapalooza]], for which festival founder and [[Jane's Addiction]] frontman [[Perry Farrell]] coined the term ''Alternative Nation''. In the late 1990s, the definition again became more specific.<ref name="altguitar"/> In 1997, [[Neil Strauss]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' defined alternative rock as "hard-edged rock distinguished by brittle, '70s-inspired guitar riffing and singers agonizing over their problems until they take on epic proportions".<ref name=1997Definition/>

Defining music as alternative is often difficult because of two conflicting applications of the word. ''Alternative'' can describe music that challenges the status quo and that is "fiercely iconoclastic, anticommercial, and antimainstream", but the term is also used in the music industry to denote "the choices available to consumers via record stores, radio, cable television, and the Internet."<ref>Starr, Larry; Waterman, Christopher. ''American Popular Music: From Minstrelsy to MTV''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. p. 430. ISBN 0-19-510854-X.</ref> However alternative music has paradoxically become just as commercial and marketable as the mainstream rock, with record companies using the term "alternative" to market music to an audience that mainstream rock does not reach.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dolan|first1=Emily|title=‘...This little ukulele tells the truth’:indie pop and kitsch authenticity|journal=Popular Music|date=2010|volume=29/3|pages=457–469|doi=10.1017/s0261143010000437}}</ref>  Using a broad definition of the genre, Dave Thompson in his book ''Alternative Rock'' cites the formation of the [[Sex Pistols]] as well as the release of the albums ''[[Horses (album)|Horses]]'' by [[Patti Smith]] and ''[[Metal Machine Music]]'' by [[Lou Reed]] as three key events that gave birth to alternative rock.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=thompson,Dave.+Alternative+Rock.&client=firefox-a&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Alternative Rock'' by Dave Thompson, reprinted by Google Books]</ref> Until recent years (early 2000s) when [[indie rock]] became the most common term in the US to describe modern pop and rock, the terms "indie rock" and "alternative rock" were often used interchangeably;<ref name=Fonarow>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/wendy-fonarow Fonarow, Wendy] (July 28, 2011).

==Characteristics==
The name "alternative rock" essentially serves as an [[umbrella term]] for underground music that has emerged in the wake of [[punk rock]] since the mid-1980s.<ref name="American alt-rock">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=essay/american-alternative-rock--post-punk-t578|pure_url=yes}} "American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk"]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved May 20, 2006.</ref> Throughout much of its history, alternative rock has been largely defined by its rejection of the [[commercialism]] of mainstream culture, although this could be contested ever since some of the major alternative artists have achieved mainstream success or co-opted with the major labels from the 1990s onwards (especially since the new millennium and beyond). Alternative bands during the 1980s generally played in small clubs, recorded for indie labels, and spread their popularity through word of mouth.<ref name="encarta">"Rock Music". Microsoft Encarta 2006 [CD]. Redmond, WA: Microsoft Corporation, 2005.</ref> As such, there is no set musical style for alternative rock as a whole, although ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1989 asserted that the genre is "guitar music first of all, with guitars that blast out power chords, pick out chiming riffs, buzz with fuzztone and squeal in feedback."<ref>Pareles, Jon.

Retrieved July 19, 2009.</ref> Sounds range from the gloomy soundscapes of [[gothic rock]] to the jangling guitars of [[indie pop]] to the dirty guitars of [[grunge]] to the 1960s/1970s revivalism of [[Britpop]]. More often than in other rock-styles since the mainstreaming of rock music during the 1970s, alternative rock lyrics tend to address topics of social concern, such as drug use, depression, suicide, and environmentalism.<ref name="encarta"/> This approach to lyrics developed as a reflection of the social and economic strains in the United States and United Kingdom of the 1980s and early 1990s.<ref>Charlton, Katherine.

==History==

===The 1980s===
[[File:Padova REM concert July 22 2003 blue.jpg|alt=Male singer in white shirtsleeves and trousers, with a band behind him on a small stage.|thumb|left|One of the first popular alternative rock bands, [[R.E.M.]] relied on [[Campus radio|college-radio]] airplay, constant touring, and a grassroots fanbase to break into the musical mainstream.]]

By 1984, a majority of groups signed to [[independent record label]]s mined from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper-rational post-punk years.<ref>Reynolds, p.&nbsp;392–93.</ref>

{{quote box|quote="Alternative music is music that hasn't yet achieved a mainstream audience, Alternative isn't new wave any more, it's a disposition of mind. Alternative music is any kind of music that has the potential to reach a wider audience.

</ref>|width=27%|style=padding:8px;}}

Throughout the 1980s, alternative rock remained mainly an underground phenomenon. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily featured on [[independent record label]]s, [[fanzine]]s, and [[Campus radio|college radio]] stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and by regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country.<ref name="American alt-rock"/> Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success.<ref>
Azerrad (2001), p.&nbsp;3–5.</ref> By 1989 the genre had become popular enough that a package tour featuring [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Public Image Limited]] and [[The Sugarcubes]] toured the United States arena circuit.<ref>"Review/Rock; Arena-Size Bill of Alternative Rock". ''The New York Times''. July 21, 1989. "It was the final show on a package tour that brought what used to be post-punk ''alternative'' rock, the province of clubs and cult audiences, to the arena circuit across the United States."</ref>

In contrast, British alternative rock was distinguished from that of the United States early on by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US.<ref name="British alt-rock">Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/british-alternative-rock-t579 "British Alternative Rock"]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved May 20, 2006.</ref> Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by [[disc jockey]]s such as [[John Peel]] (who championed alternative music on [[BBC Radio 1]]), [[Richard Skinner (broadcaster)|Richard Skinner]], and [[Annie Nightingale]]. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.<ref>Charlton, p. 349.</ref>

Early American alternative bands such as [[Dream Syndicate]], [[R.E.M.]], [[The Feelies]] and [[Violent Femmes]] combined punk influences with [[folk music]] and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; its debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'' (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of [[jangle pop]] followers.<ref>{{cite web|title=REM Biography|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/R-E-M-Biography/9B195AA5AA60344A482568940015EB16|publisher=Sing 365|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref>  One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles' [[Paisley Underground]] revived the sounds of the 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as [[The Velvet Underground]].<ref name="American alt-rock"/>

American indie record labels [[SST Records]], [[Twin/Tone Records]], [[Touch and Go Records]], and [[Dischord Records]] presided over the shift from the [[hardcore punk]] that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.<ref name=Reynolds390>Reynolds, p. 390.</ref> [[Minneapolis]] bands [[Hüsker Dü]] and [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic.<ref name="American alt-rock"/> [[Michael Azerrad]] asserted that Hüsker Dü was the key link between hardcore punk and the more melodic, diverse music of [[college rock]] that emerged. Azerrad wrote, "Hüsker Dü played a huge role in convincing the underground that melody and punk rock weren't antithetical."<ref>{{cite news|title=Indie music pioneer returns with a little help from his admirershis|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/indie-music-pioneer-returns-with-a-little-help-from-his-admirers-20130305-2fivn.html|accessdate=20 June 2013|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>  The band also set an example by being the first group from the American indie scene to sign to a major record label, which helped establish college rock as "a viable commercial enterprise."<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 159.</ref> By focusing on heartfelt songwriting and wordplay instead of political concerns, The Replacements upended a number of underground scene conventions; Azerrad noted that "along with R.E.M. [The Replacements] were one of the few underground bands that mainstream people liked."<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 196.</ref>

By the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop ([[They Might Be Giants]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]]), to [[noise rock]] ([[Sonic Youth]], [[Big Black]], [[The Jesus Lizard]]<ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=the-jesus-lizard-mn0000089305|pure_url=yes}} "The Jesus Lizard Biography"]. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved August 25, 2008.</ref>) and [[industrial rock]] ([[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Nine Inch Nails]]). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of [[Boston]]'s [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Los Angeles]]' [[Jane's Addiction]].<ref name="American alt-rock"/> Around the same time, the [[grunge]] subgenre emerged in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], initially referred to as "The Seattle Sound" until its rise to popularity in the early 1990s.<ref>http://rock.about.com/od/top10lists/tp/Most-Influential-Seattle-Bands.htm</ref> Grunge featured a sludgy, murky guitar sound that synthesized [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and punk rock.<ref>{{cite web|title=Genre&nbsp;– Grunge|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=grunge-ma0000002626|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=October 6, 2007}}</ref> Promoted largely by Seattle indie label [[Sub Pop]], grunge bands were noted for their thrift store fashion which favored flannel shirts and combat boots suited to the local weather.<ref name="success NYT">Marin, Rick.

By the end of the decade, a number of alternative bands began to sign to major labels. While early major label signings Hüsker Dü and The Replacements had little success, acts who signed with majors in their wake such as R.E.M. and Jane's Addiction achieved gold and platinum records, setting the stage for alternative's later breakthrough.<ref name=buzz>Azerrad (1994), p. 160.</ref><ref>Azerrad (1994), p. 4.</ref> Some bands such as Pixies had massive success overseas while they were ignored domestically.<ref name="American alt-rock"/>

In the middle of the decade [[Hüsker Dü]]'s album [[Zen Arcade]] influenced other hardcore acts by tackling personal issues. Out of Washington, D.C.'s hardcore scene what was called "emocore" or "[[emo]]" emerged and was noted for its lyrics which delved into emotional very personal subject matter (vocalists sometimes cried) and added free association poetry and a confessional tone. [[Rites of Spring]] has been described as the first "emo" band. Former [[Minor Threat]] singer [[Ian MacKaye]] founded [[Dischord Records]] which became the center for the city's emo scene.<ref name=Allmusicemo>[http://www.allmusic.com/style/emo-ma0000004447 AllMusic emo genre essay]</ref>

====British genres and trends of the 1980s====
[[File:Robertsmith.jpg|alt=Head and shoulders shot of man, with wild, tangled hair and lipstick on, playing in a stage spotlight.|thumb|[[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]] rejects the genre labels like alternative, [[gothic rock]], and [[college rock]] applied to his band. He has said, "Every time we went to America we had a different tag&nbsp;... I can't remember when we officially became 'alt-rock'".<ref>Spitz, Marc. "Robert Smith". ''Spin''. November 2005</ref>]]

[[Gothic rock]] developed out of late-1970s British [[post-punk]]. With a reputation as the "darkest and gloomiest form of underground rock", gothic rock utilizes a synthesizer-and-guitar based sound drawn from post-punk to construct "foreboding, sorrowful, often epic soundscapes", and the genre's lyrics often address literary romanticism, morbidity, religious symbolism, and supernatural mysticism.<ref name="Goth">{{cite web|title=Genre&nbsp;– Goth Rock|publisher=[[AllMusic]] |url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=goth-rock-ma0000002623|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=October 6, 2007}}</ref> This genre among bands that took inspiration from late-1970s British post-punk groups, [[Joy Division]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].<ref>Reynolds, p. 352.</ref> [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]' debut single "[[Bela Lugosi's Dead]]", released in 1979, is considered to be the proper beginning of the gothic rock genre.<ref>Reynolds, p. 359.</ref> [[The Cure]]'s "oppressively dispirited" albums ''[[Seventeen Seconds]]'' (1980), ''[[Faith (The Cure album)|Faith]]'' (1981), ''[[Pornography (album)|Pornography]]'' (1982) and their opus ''[[Disintegration (The Cure album)|Disintegration]]'' (1989) cemented that group's stature in that style and laid the foundation for its large cult following.<ref>Reynolds, p. 357–58.</ref>

The key British alternative rock band to emerge during the 1980s was [[Manchester]]'s [[The Smiths]]. Music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] singled out The Smiths and their American contemporaries R.E.M. as "the two most important alt-rock bands of the day", commenting that they "were eighties bands only in the sense of being ''against'' the eighties". Reynolds noted that The Smiths' "whole stance was predicated on their British audience being a lost generation, exiles in their own land".<ref>Reynolds, p. 392.</ref> The Smiths' embrace of the guitar in an era of synthesizer-dominated music is viewed as signaling the end of the new wave era and the advent of alternative rock in the United Kingdom. Despite the band's limited chart success and short career, The Smiths exerted an influence over the British indie scene through the end of the decade, as various bands drew from singer [[Morrissey]]'s English-centered lyrical topics and guitarist [[Johnny Marr]]'s jangly guitar-playing style.<ref name="British alt-rock" /> The ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]'' cassette, a 1986 ''[[NME]]'' premium featuring [[Primal Scream]], [[The Wedding Present]] and others, was a major influence on the development of [[indie pop]] and the British [[Indie music scene|indie scene]] as a whole.<ref>{{cite news | author=Hann, Michael | date=October 13, 2004 | title=Fey City Rollers | work=The Guardian | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/oct/13/popandrock| accessdate=July 19, 2009 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author=Hasted, Nick | date=October 27, 2006 | title=How an NME cassette launched indie music | work=The Independent | url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/how-an-nme-cassette-launched-indie-music-421802.html | accessdate=July 19, 2009 | location=London}}</ref>

Other forms of alternative rock developed in the UK during the 1980s.

===Popularization in the 1990s===

{{Listen|filename=NirvanaSmellsLikeTeenSpirit.ogg|title="Smells Like Teen Spirit"|description=Sample of "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" from [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s breakthrough album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991). The sample illustrates the change in dynamics from verse to pre-chorus and chorus. This structure of "quiet verses with wobbly, [[Chorus effect|chorused]] guitar, followed by big, loud [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]]-inspired choruses" became a much-emulated template in alternative rock because of "Teen Spirit."<ref name="altguitar"/>|format=[[Ogg]]}}
By the start of the 1990s, the music industry was enticed by alternative rock's commercial possibilities and major labels actively courted bands including [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Dinosaur Jr.]], [[Firehose (band)|Firehose]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref name="buzz"/> In particular, R.E.M.'s success had become a blueprint for many alternative bands in the late 1980s and 1990s to follow; the group had outlasted many of its contemporaries and by the 1990s had become one of the most popular bands in the world.<ref name="American alt-rock"/>

The breakthrough success of the band Nirvana led to the widespread popularization of alternative rock in the 1990s. The release of the band's single "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" from its second album ''[[Nevermind]]'' (1991) "marked the instigation of the grunge music phenomenon". Due to constant airplay of the song's music video on [[MTV]], ''Nevermind'' was selling 400,000 copies a week by Christmas 1991.<ref>Lyons, p. 120.</ref> The success of ''Nevermind'' surprised the music industry. ''Nevermind'' not only popularized grunge, but also established "the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general."<ref>{{cite web | author=Olsen, Eric | title=10 years later, Cobain lives on in his music | publisher=[[MSNBC|MSNBC.com]] | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4652653/ | date=April 9, 2004 | accessdate=July 25, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828075858/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4652653/ | archivedate=August 28, 2007 | deadurl=no}}</ref> Michael Azerrad asserted that ''Nevermind'' symbolized "a sea-change in rock music" in which the [[glam metal|hair metal]] that had dominated rock music at that time fell out of favor in the face of music that was authentic and culturally relevant.<ref>Azerrad (1994), p.&nbsp;229–30.</ref>

Nirvana's surprise success with ''Nevermind'' heralded a "new openness to alternative rock" among commercial radio stations, opening doors for heavier alternative bands in particular.<ref>Rosen, Craig. "Some See 'New Openness' Following Nirvana Success". ''Billboard''. January 25, 1992.</ref> In the wake of ''Nevermind'', alternative rock "found itself dragged-kicking and screaming&nbsp;... into the mainstream" and record companies, confused by the genre's success yet eager to capitalize on it, scrambled to sign bands.<ref>{{cite news | author=Browne, David | date=August 21, 1992 | title=Turn That @#!% Down! | publisher=EW.com | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311492,00.html | accessdate=April 17, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516121917/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,311492,00.html | archivedate=May 16, 2007 | deadurl=no}}</ref> ''The New York Times'' declared in 1993, "Alternative rock doesn't seem so alternative anymore.

====Grunge explosion====
{{Main|Grunge}}
[[File:Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam in concert in Italy 2006.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Eddie Vedder]] of [[Pearl Jam]]]]
Other grunge bands subsequently replicated Nirvana's success. [[Pearl Jam]] had released its debut album ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]'' a month before ''[[Nevermind]]'' in 1991, but album sales only picked up a year later.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smackdown: Pearl Jam vs. Nirvana|url=http://soundcheck.wnyc.org/2011/sep/20/smackdown-grunge-turns-20/|publisher=Soundcheck|accessdate=20 June 2013}}</ref>  By the second half of 1992 ''Ten'' became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart.<ref>Pearlman, Nina.

At the same time, critics asserted that advertising was co-opting elements of grunge and turning it into a fad. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented in a 1993 article, "There hasn't been this kind of exploitation of a subculture since the media discovered hippies in the '60s."<ref>{{cite news | date=April 2, 1993 | title=Smells Like Big Bucks | publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,306055,00.html | accessdate=July 25, 2007 | author=Kobel, Peter}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'' compared the "grunging of America" to the mass-marketing of punk rock, [[disco]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] in previous years.

With the decline of the Madchester scene and the unglamorousness of shoegazing, the tide of grunge from America dominated the British alternative scene and music press in the early 1990s.<ref name="British alt-rock"/> As a reaction, a flurry of British bands emerged that wished to "get rid of grunge" and "declare war on America", taking the public and native music press by storm.<ref>Youngs, Ian. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4144458.stm "Looking back at the birth of Britpop"]. ''[[BBC News]]''. August 14, 2005.

Blur won "[[The Battle of Britpop]]", but Oasis soon eclipsed the other band in popularity with its second album, ''[[(What's the Story) Morning Glory?]]'' (1995),<ref>Harris, p. xvii.</ref> which went on to become the third best-selling album in the UK's history.<ref>{{cite news | date=November 16, 2006 | title=Queen head all-time sales chart | publisher=BBC.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6151050.stm | accessdate=January 3, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204064437/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6151050.stm | archivedate=February 4, 2007 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

====Other trends====
Long synonymous with alternative rock as a whole in the US, [[indie rock]] became a distinct form following the popular breakthrough of Nirvana.<ref name="allmusic indie rock"/> Indie rock was formulated as a rejection of both alternative rock's absorption into the mainstream by artists who could not or refused to cross over, and a wariness of its "macho" aesthetic. While indie rock artists share the punk rock distrust of commercialism, the genre does not entirely define itself against that, as "the general assumption is that it's virtually impossible to make indie rock's varying musical approaches compatible with mainstream tastes in the first place".<ref name="allmusic indie rock">{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=indie-rock-ma0000004453|pure_url=yes}} | title=Indie Rock | accessdate=August 2, 2009 | publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

Labels such as [[Matador Records]], [[Merge Records]], and [[Dischord Records|Dischord]], and indie rockers like [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Superchunk]], [[Fugazi (band)|Fugazi]], and [[Sleater-Kinney]] dominated the American [[Indie music scene|indie scene]] for most of the 1990s.<ref>Azerrad (2001), pp. 495–97.</ref> One of the main indie rock movements of the 1990s was [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]. The movement, which focused on the recording and distribution of music on low-quality [[cassette tapes]], initially emerged in the 1980s. By 1992, Pavement, Guided by Voices and [[Sebadoh]] became popular lo-fi cult acts in the United States, while subsequently artists like [[Beck]] and [[Liz Phair]] brought the aesthetic to mainstream audiences.<ref name="allmusic lofi">{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=lo-fi-ma0000002701|pure_url=yes}} | title=Lo-Fi | accessdate=August 2, 2009 | publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The period also saw alternative confessional female singer-songwriters. Besides the aforementioned Liz Phair, [[Lynda Thomas]], [[PJ Harvey]] and the massively successful [[Alanis Morissette]] fit into this sub group.<ref>Erlewine, Stephen Thomas.

In 1993, [[Smashing Pumpkins]] album ''[[Siamese Dream]]'' was a major commercial success. The strong influence of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[progressive rock]] on the album helped to legitimize alternative rock to mainstream radio programmers and close the gap between alternative rock and the type of rock played on American 1970s [[Album Oriented Rock]] radio.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/smashing-pumpkins-mn0000036521 AllMusic Smashing Pumpkins bio]</ref>

During the latter half of the 1990s, grunge was supplanted by [[post-grunge]]. Many post-grunge bands lacked the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become, namely "a wildly popular form of inward-looking, serious-minded hard rock."; many post-grunge bands emulated the sound and style of grunge, "but not necessarily the individual idiosyncracies of its original artists."<ref name="allmusic postgrunge"/> Post-grunge was a more commercially viable genre that tempered the distorted guitars of grunge with polished, radio-ready production.<ref name="allmusic postgrunge">{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=post-grunge-ma0000005020|pure_url=yes}} | title=Post-Grunge | accessdate=August 28, 2007 | publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Originally, post-grunge was a label used almost pejoratively on bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and emulated the grunge sound. The label suggested that bands labelled as post-grunge were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an "authentic" rock movement.<ref name=PostGrungeAbout>{{cite web| author=Grierson, Tim |url=http://rock.about.com/od/rockmusic101/a/PostGrunge.htm|title=Post-Grunge. A History of Post-Grunge Rock |publisher=[[About.com]]}}</ref> Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul were labelled almost pejoratively as post-grunge which, according to Tim Grierson of [[About.com]], is "suggesting that rather than being a musical movement in their own right, they were just a calculated, cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in [[rock music]]."<ref name=PostGrungeAbout /> Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s as post-grunge bands such as [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Nickelback]] emerged.<ref name=PostGrungeAbout />

[[Post-rock]] was established by [[Talk Talk]]'s ''[[Laughing Stock (album)|Laughing Stock]]'' and [[Slint]]'s ''[[Spiderland]]'' albums, both released in 1991.<ref name="allmusic postrock"/> Post-rock draws influence from a number of genres, including [[Krautrock]], [[progressive rock]], and [[jazz]]. The genre subverts or rejects rock conventions, and often incorporates electronic music.<ref name="allmusic postrock"/> While the name of the genre was coined by music journalist Simon Reynolds in 1994, the style of the genre was solidified by the release of ''[[Millions Now Living Will Never Die]]'' (1996) by the Chicago group [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]].<ref name="allmusic postrock"/> Post-rock became the dominant form of experimental rock music in the 1990s and bands from the genre signed to such labels as [[Thrill Jockey]], [[Kranky Records|Kranky]], [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]], and [[Too Pure]].<ref name="allmusic postrock">{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=post-rock-ma0000002790|pure_url=yes}} | title=Post-Rock | accessdate=July 28, 2009 | publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> A related genre, [[math rock]], peaked in the mid-1990s. In comparison to post-rock, math rock is more "[[Rockism|rockist]]" and relies on complex [[time signatures]] and intertwining phrases.<ref name="allmusic mathrock">{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=style|id=math-rock-ma0000012250|pure_url=yes}} | title=Math Rock | accessdate=August 6, 2009 | publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> While by the end of the decade a backlash had emerged against post-rock due to its "dispassionate intellectuality" and its perceived increasing predictability, a new wave of post-rock bands such as [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] and [[Sigur Rós]] emerged who further expanded the genre.<ref name="allmusic postrock" />

After almost a decade in the underground, [[ska punk]], a mixture of earlier [[2 Tone|British ska]] and punk acts, became popular in the United States. [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] was the first of the "Third Wave Ska Revival" acts to break. In 1996, [[the Mighty Mighty Bosstones]], [[No Doubt]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]], [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Less Than Jake]] and [[Save Ferris]] charted or received radio exposure.<ref>Thompson, Dave.

====Decline of popularity====
By the end of the decade, alternative rock's mainstream prominence declined due to a number of events, notably the [[Death of Kurt Cobain|death]] of Nirvana's [[Kurt Cobain]] in 1994 and Pearl Jam's lawsuit against concert venue promoter [[Ticketmaster]], which in effect barred the group from playing many major venues around the United States.<ref name="decade"/> In addition to the decline of grunge bands, Britpop faded as Oasis's third album, ''[[Be Here Now (album)|Be Here Now]]'' (1997), received lackluster reviews and Blur began to incorporate influences from American alternative rock.<ref>Harris, p. xix.</ref> A signifier of alternative rock's declining popularity was the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival after an unsuccessful attempt to find a headliner in 1998. In light of the festival's troubles that year, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said, "Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now".<ref>Weisbard, Eric. "This Monkey's Gone to Heaven". ''Spin''. July 1998.</ref>

Despite alternative rock's declining popularity, some artists retained mainstream relevance. Post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, when bands like [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Matchbox Twenty]] became among the most popular rock bands in the United States.<ref name="allmusic postgrunge"/> At the same time Britpop began to decline, [[Radiohead]] achieved critical acclaim with its third album ''[[OK Computer]]'' (1997), and its follow-ups ''[[Kid A]]'' (2000) and ''[[Amnesiac (album)|Amnesiac]]'' (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with [[post-Britpop]] groups like [[Travis (band)|Travis]] and [[Coldplay]], were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.<ref>Harris, p.&nbsp;369–70.</ref>

In the mid-1990s [[Sunny Day Real Estate]] defined the "emo" genre for many. [[Weezer]]'s album ''[[Pinkerton (album)|Pinkerton]]'' (1996) was also influential. By 2000 and on into the new decade emo was one of the most popular rock music genres.<ref name=Allmusicemo/> Popular acts included platinum selling success of ''[[Bleed American]]'' by [[Jimmy Eat World]] (2001) and [[Dashboard Confessional]]'s ''[[The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most]]'' (2003).<ref name=DeRogatis2003>{{Cite journal | last = J.
