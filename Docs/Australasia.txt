'''Australasia''', a [[region]] of [[Oceania]], comprises [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], the island of [[New Guinea]], and neighbouring [[island]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]].  [[Charles de Brosses]] coined the term (as French ''Australasie'') in ''Histoire des navigations aux terres australes''<ref>

==Physical geography==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
[[Physical geography|Physiographically]], Australasia includes [[New Zealand]], Australia (including [[Tasmania]]), and [[Melanesia]]: [[New Guinea]] and neighbouring islands north and east of Australia in the Pacific Ocean.  The designation is sometimes applied to all the lands and islands of the Pacific Ocean lying between the [[equator]] and [[latitude]] [[47th parallel south|47° south]].

Most of Australasia lies on the southern portion of the [[Indo-Australian Plate]], flanked by the [[Indian Ocean]] to the west and the [[Southern Ocean]] to the south.  Peripheral territories lie on the [[Eurasian Plate]] to the northwest, the [[Philippine Plate]] to the north, and in the Pacific Ocean – including numerous [[marginal sea]]s – atop the [[Pacific Plate]] to the north and east.

[[Geopolitics|Geopolitically]], ''Australasia'' sometimes refers to Australia and New Zealand together{{spaced ndash}}in the absence of another word limited to those two countries; however, the two countries are sometimes referred to collectively as the Antipodes. Sometimes the term also encompasses the island of New Guinea ([[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Indonesia]]n part of the island). Many organisations whose names include the  prefix "[Royal] Australasian Society of&nbsp;..." limit their scope of operation to just Australia and New Zealand.

In the past, Australasia has been used as a name for combined Australia/New Zealand sporting teams. Examples include [[tennis]] between 1905 and 1915, when New Zealand and Australia combined to compete in the [[Davis Cup]] international tournament, and at the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] of [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]] and [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]].

{{ main|Australasia ecozone}}

From an [[ecology|ecological]] perspective the [[Australasia ecozone]] forms a distinct region with a common geologic and evolutionary history and a great many unique [[plant|flora]] and [[animal|fauna]]. In this context, Australasia is limited to Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, [[New Caledonia]], and neighbouring islands, including the [[Indonesia]]n islands from [[Lombok]] and [[Sulawesi]] eastward. The [[Wallace Line]] marks the biological divide from the [[Indomalaya ecozone]] of tropical [[Asia]] – [[Borneo]] and [[Bali]] lie on the western, Asian side.

Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia are all fragments of the ancient supercontinent [[Gondwana]], the marks of which are still visible in the [[Christmas Island Seamount Province]] and other geophysical entities. These three land masses have been separated from other continents, and from one another, for millions of years. All of Australasia shares the [[Antarctic flora]], although the northern, tropical islands also share many plants with Southeast Asia.

Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania are separated from one another by shallow [[continental shelf|continental shelves]], and were linked together when the sea level was lower during the [[Ice Ages]]. They share a similar fauna which includes [[marsupial]] and [[monotreme]] mammals and [[ratite]] birds. [[Eucalypt]]s are the predominant trees in much of Australia and New Guinea. New Zealand has no native land mammals, but also had ratite birds, including the [[kiwi]] and the extinct [[moa]]. The Australasia ecozone includes some nearby island groups, like [[Wallacea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Solomon Islands]], and [[Vanuatu]], which were not formerly part of Gondwana, but which share many characteristic plants and animals with Australasia.
