'''Albanian''' ({{lang|sq|''shqip''}} {{IPA-sq|ʃcip|}} or {{lang|sq|''gjuha shqipe''}} {{IPA-sq|ˈɟuha ˈʃcipɛ|}}, meaning ''Albanian language'') is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] spoken by five million people,<ref name="e18"/> primarily in [[Albania]], [[Kosovo]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]], and [[Greece]], but also in other areas of [[Southeastern Europe]] in which there is an Albanian population, including [[Montenegro]] and the [[Preševo Valley]] of [[Serbia]]. Centuries-old communities speaking Albanian-based dialects can be found scattered in [[Greece]], southern [[Italy]],<ref>http://www.minorityrights.org/1617/italy/albanians.html</ref> [[Sicily]], and [[Ukraine]].<ref>http://www.albanianlanguage.net/</ref> As a result of a modern [[diaspora]], there are also Albanian speakers elsewhere in those countries as well as in other parts of the world, including [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], and [[Turkey]].

{{Indo-European topics}}

The first written mention of the Albanian language was on 14 July 1285 in [[Dubrovnik]] (modern-day [[Croatia]]), when a certain Matthew, witness of a crime, stated "I heard a voice shouting on the mountainside in the ''Albanian tongue''" ({{lang-lat|Audivi unam vocem, clamantem in monte in lingua albanesca}}).<ref name="Hammond1976">{{cite book|author =Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond|title=Migrations and invasions in Greece and adjacent areas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9saAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=23 January 2013|year=1976|publisher=Noyes Press|isbn=978-0-8155-5047-1|page=57}}</ref><ref name="Zeitschrift für Balkanologie">{{cite book|title=Zeitschrift für Balkanologie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLkWAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=23 January 2013|year=1990|publisher=R.

=== Linguistic affinities ===

The Albanian language is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] in a [[language family#Subdivision|branch]] by itself, sharing its branch [[language isolate|with no other extant language]]. The other extant Indo-European languages in a branch by themselves are [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and, in some classifications, [[Greek language|Greek]]. Though sharing lexical [[isogloss]]es with Greek, [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], the vocabulary of Albanian is quite distinct. Once hastily grouped with Germanic and Balto-Slavic based on the merger of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''ǒ'' and *''ǎ'' into *''ǎ'' in a supposed "northern group",{{sfn|Watkins|1998|p=38}} Albanian has been proven to be distinct from these two because this vowel shift is only part of a larger [[Chain shift|push chain]] that affected all long vowels.{{sfn|Labov|1994|p=42}} Albanian does share two features with Balto-Slavic languages: a lengthening of syllabic consonants before voiced obstruents and a distinct treatment of long syllables ending in a sonorant.{{sfn|Hamp|1994|pp=66–67}} Conservative features of Albanian include the retention of the distinction between active and [[Voice (grammar)#Middle|middle voice]], present tense, and [[aorist]].

Albanian is considered to have evolved from an ancient [[Paleo-Balkan language]], usually taken to be either [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] or [[Thracian language|Thracian]]. (See also [[Thraco-Illyrian]] and [[Messapian language]].)

=== Linguistic influences ===

The earliest loanwords attested in Albanian come from [[Doric Greek]],<ref name="huld">{{cite journal
| author = Huld, Martin E. | title = Accentual Stratification of Ancient Greek Loanwords in Albanian | journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|issue=99.2 | year = 1986 | pages = 245–253}}</ref> whereas the strongest influence came from [[Latin]]. The period during which Proto-Albanian and Latin interacted was protracted and drawn out roughly from the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=9}} This is borne out into roughly three layers of borrowings, the largest number belonging to the second layer. The first, with the fewest borrowings, was a time of less important interaction. The final period, probably preceding the Slavic or Germanic invasions, also has a notably smaller number of borrowings. Each layer is characterized by a different treatment of most vowels, the first layer having several that follow the evolution of Early Proto-Albanian into Albanian; later layers reflect vowel changes endemic to Late Latin and presumably [[Proto-Romance language|Proto-Romance]]. Other formative changes include the syncretism of several noun case endings, especially in the plural, as well as a large-scale palatalization.

A brief period followed, between the 7th and 9th centuries, that was marked by heavy borrowings from [[South Slavic languages|Southern Slavic]], some of which predate the "o-a" shift common to the modern forms of this language group. Starting in the latter 9th century, there was a period characterized by protracted contact with the Proto-Romanians, or Vlachs, though lexical borrowing seems to have been mostly one sided—from Albanian into Romanian. Such borrowing indicates that the Romanians migrated from an area where the majority was Slavic (i.e. Middle Bulgarian) to an area with a majority of Albanian speakers (i.e. [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]], where Vlachs are recorded in the 10th century). Their movement is probably related to the expansion of the [[Bulgarian Empire]] into Albania around that time.

=== Latin influence ===

[[Jernej Kopitar]] (1780–1844) was the first to note Latin's influence on Albanian and claimed "the Latin loanwords in the Albanian language had the pronunciation of the time of Emperor Augustus".{{sfn|Kopitar|1829|p=254}} Kopitar gave examples such as Albanian "qiqer" from Latin ''cicer'' (meaning ''chickpeas''), "qytet" from ''civitas'' (meaning ''city''), "peshk" from ''piscis'' (meaning ''fish'') and "shigjetë" from ''sagitta'' (meaning ''arrow''). The hard pronunciations of Latin {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} are retained as palatal and velar stops in the Albanian loanwords. Gustav Meyer (1888){{sfn|Meyer|1888|p=805}} and [[Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke]] (1914){{sfn|Meyer-Lübke|1914|p=32}} later corroborated this. Meyer noted the similarity between the Albanian verbs ''shqipoj'' and ''shqiptoj'' (both meaning ''to enunciate'') and the Latin word ''excipio'' (meaning ''to welcome''). Therefore, he believed that the word ''Shqiptar'' (meaning ''Albanian'') was derived from ''shqipoj'', which in turn was derived from the Latin word ''excipio''. [[Johann Georg von Hahn]], an Austrian linguist, previously proposed the same theory in 1854.<ref>{{cite book|title=Wir sind die Deinen. Studien zur albanischen Sprache, Literatur und Kulturgeschichte, dem Gedenken an Martin Camaj (1925–1992) gewidmet|author =Bardhyl Demiraj|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-06221-3|date=2010}}</ref>

[[Eqrem Çabej]] also noticed, among other things, the archaic Latin elements in Albanian:{{sfn|Çabej|1962|pp=13–51}}

# Latin /au/ becomes Albanian /a/ in the earliest borrowings: "aurum" > "ar" ; "gaudium" > "gaz" ; "laurus" > "lar". But Latin /au/ is retained in later borrowings: "causa" > "kafshë" ; "laud" > "lavd".
# Latin /ō/ becomes Albanian /e/ in the oldest Latin borrowings: "pōmum" > "pemë" ; "hōra" > "herë". An analogous mutation occurred from Proto-Indo-European to Albanian; PIE ''*nōs'' became Albanian "ne", PIE ''*oḱtō'' + suffix ''-ti-'' became Albanian "tetë" etc.
# Latin unstressed internal and initial syllables become lost in Albanian: "cubitus" > "kub" ; "medicus" > "mjek" ; "paludem" > V. Latin "padule" > "pyll". An analogous mutation occurred from Proto-Indo-European to Albanian. In contrast, in later Latin borrowings, the internal syllable is retained: "paganus" > "pagan" ; "plaga" > "plagë" etc.
# Latin /tj/, /dj/, /kj/ palatalized to Albanian /s/, /z/, /c/: "vitius" > "ves" ; "ratio" > "arsye" ; "radius" > "rreze" ; "facies" > "faqe" ; "socius" > "shoq" etc.

Haralambie Mihăescu demonstrated that:

* Some 85 Latin words have survived in Albanian but not (as inherited) in any [[Romance language]]. A few examples include ''bubulcus'' > ''bujk'', ''hibernalia'' > ''mërrajë'', ''sarcinarius'' > ''shelqëror'', ''trifurcus'' > ''tërfurk'', ''accipiter'' > ''skifter'', ''musconea'' > ''mushkonjë'', ''chersydrus'' > ''kuçedër'', ''spleneticum'' > ''shpretkë'', ''solanum'' > ''shullë''.{{sfn|Mihaescu|1966|pp=1, 30}}
* 151 Albanian words of Latin origin were not inherited in Romanian. A few examples include Albanian ''mik'' from Latin ''amicus'', or ''armik'' from ''inimicus'', ''arsye'' from ''rationem'', ''bekoj'' from ''benedicere'', ''qelq'' from ''calix'' (''calicis''), ''kështjellë'' from ''castellum'', ''qind'' from ''centum'', ''gjel'' from ''gallus'', ''gjymtyrë'' from ''iunctura'', ''mjek'' from ''medicus'', ''rrjetë'' from ''rete'', ''shpresoj'' from ''sperare'', ''vullnet'' from ''voluntas'' (''voluntatis'').{{sfn|Mihaescu|1966|pp=1, 21}}
* Some Albanian church terminology have phonetic features which demonstrate their very early borrowing from Latin. A few examples include Albanian ''altar'' from Latin ''altare'', ''engjëll'' from ''angelus'', ''bekoj'' from ''benedicere'',''i krishterë'' from ''christianus'', ''kryq'' from ''crux'' (''crucis''), ''kishë'' from ''ecclesia'', ''ipeshkv'' from ''episcopus'', ''ungjill'' from ''evangelium'', ''mallkoj'' from ''maledicere'', ''meshë'' from ''missa'', ''murg'' from ''monacus'', "pagan" from ''paganus''.{{sfn|Mihaescu|1966|pp=1–2}}

Other authors{{sfn|Rosetti|1986|pp=195–197}} have detected Latin loanwords in Albanian with an ancient sound pattern from the 1st century BC, for example, Albanian ''qingëlë'' from Latin ''cingula'' and Albanian ''e vjetër'' from Latin ''vetus''/''veteris''. The  [[Romance languages]] inherited these words from Vulgar Latin: Vulgar ''*cingla'' became N. Romanian ''chinga'', meaning "belly band, saddle girth", and Vulgar ''veteran'' became N. Romanian ''bătrân'', meaning "old".

Albanian, [[Basque language|Basque]], and the surviving [[Celtic languages]] such as [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] are the non-Romance languages today that have this sort of extensive Latin element dating from ancient Roman times, which have undergone the sound changes associated with the languages.

=== Historical presence and location ===
{{Main|Origin of the Albanians}}

The place where the Albanian language was formed is uncertain, but analysis has suggested that it was in a mountainous region rather than on a plain or seacoast:{{sfn|Hamp|1963|}} while the words for plants and animals characteristic of mountainous regions are entirely original, the names for fish and for agricultural activities (such as [[plough]]ing) are borrowed from other languages.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=10}}
A deeper analysis of the vocabulary, however, shows that this could be a consequence of the prolonged Latin domination of the coastal and plain areas of the country, rather than evidence of the original environment where the Albanian language was formed. For example, the word for 'fish' is borrowed from Latin, but not the word for 'gills', which is native. Indigenous are also the words for 'ship', 'raft' and 'navigation', 'sea shelves' and a few names of fish kinds, but not the words for 'sail', 'row', 'harbor', objects pertaining navigation itself and a large part of sea fauna. This rather shows that Proto-Albanians were pushed away from coastal areas in early times (probably after the Latin conquest of the region) thus losing large parts (or the majority) of sea environment lexicon. A similar phenomenon could be observed with agricultural terms. While the words for 'arable land', 'corn', 'wheat', 'cereals', 'vineyard', 'yoke', 'harvesting', cattle breeding etc. are native, the words for 'ploughing', 'farm' and 'farmer', agricultural practices, and some harvesting tools are foreign. This, again, points to intense contacts with other languages and people, rather than providing evidence of a possible ''Urheimat''.

[[File:AlbaniaPeriodical.jpg|thumb|October 1899 issue of the magazine Albania, the most important Albanian periodical of the early 20th century]]

The centre of Albanian settlement remained the [[Mat (river)|Mat]] river. In 1079, they were recorded farther south in the valley of the [[Shkumbin]] river.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|pp=52–53}} The Shkumbin, a seasonal stream that lies near the old [[Via Egnatia]], is approximately the boundary of the primary dialect division for Albanian, Tosk-Gheg. The characteristics of Tosk and Gheg in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages are evidence that the dialectal split preceded the [[Slavic migration to the Balkans]],{{sfn|Brown|Ogilvie|2008|p=23}}{{sfn|Fortson|2004|p=392}}{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=9}} which means that in that period (5th to 6th centuries AD) Albanians were occupying nearly the same area around the Shkumbin river, which straddled the [[Jireček Line]].{{sfn|Demiraj|1999|}}{{sfn|Hamp|1963|}}

References to the existence of Albanian as a distinct language survive from the 14th century, but they failed to cite specific words. The oldest surviving documents written in Albanian are the "[[formula e pagëzimit]]" (Baptismal formula), ''Un'te paghesont' pr'emenit t'Atit e t'Birit e t'Spertit Senit''. ("I baptize thee in [[Trinitarian formula|the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit]]") recorded by Pal Engjelli, Bishop of Durrës in 1462 in the Gheg dialect, and some [[New Testament]] verses from that period.

The oldest known Albanian printed book, ''[[Meshari]]'', or "missal", was written in 1555 by [[Gjon Buzuku]], a [[Roman Catholic]] cleric. In 1635, [[Frang Bardhi]] wrote the first Latin–Albanian dictionary. The first Albanian school is believed to have been opened by [[Franciscan]]s in 1638 in [[Pdhanë]].

One of the earliest dictionaries of Albanian language was written in 1693 [[Italian language]] manuscript authored by Montenegrin sea captain [[Julije Balović]] ''Pratichae Schrivaneschae'' which includes a multilingual dictionary of hundreds of the most often used words in the everydays life on Italian, Slavo-Illirico, [[Greek language|Greek]], Albanian and [[Turkish language]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Pantić|first=Miroslav|title=Književnost na tlu Crne Gore i Boke Kotorske od XVI do XVIII veka|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5FiAAAAMAAJ|year=1990|publisher=Srpska književna zadruga|page=98}}</ref>

== Classification ==

Albanian was demonstrated to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the [[Comparative linguistics|philologist]] [[Franz Bopp]]. The Albanian language constitutes its own branch of the Indo-European language family.<ref>{{cite book |title=Indo-European language and culture: an introduction |last= Fortson |first= Benjamin W |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location= |isbn=1-4051-0315-9|page=390 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hOtPBF6XWwC&printsec=frontcover&dq='Indo-European+Language+and+Culture:++An+Introduction'&cd=1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=28 May 2010}} ''Albanian forms its own separate branch of Indo-European; it is the last branch to appear in written records''</ref>

Albanian was formerly compared by some Indo-Europeanists with Balto-Slavic and Germanic,<ref>Watkins, Calvert. "Proto-Indo-European: Comparison and Reconstruction", in The Indo-European Languages, Anna Giacalone Ramat and Paolo Ramat, eds. London: Routledge, 1998.</ref> both of which share a number of [[isogloss]]es with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long ''o'' has fallen to ''a'', much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative ''jos'' and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. Other linguists link Albanian with [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]], while placing Germanic and Balto-Slavic in another branch of Indo-European.<ref name = mallory>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfZZX1qjpvkC&printsec=frontcover#PPA111,M1 Google Books], [[J.

=== Origin ===
Albanian is often seen as the descendant of [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]],<ref>Fine, JA. ''The Early medieval Balkans.'' University of Michigan Press, 1991. p.10. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YbS9QmwDC58C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0472081497&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Google Books]</ref> although this hypothesis has been challenged by some linguists, who maintain that it derives from [[Dacian language|Dacian]] or [[Thracian language|Thracian]].<ref>Fine, JA. ''The Early medieval Balkans.'' University of Michigan Press, 1991. p.11. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YbS9QmwDC58C&printsec=frontcover&dq=isbn:0472081497&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Google Books]</ref> (Illyrian, Dacian, and Thracian, however, may have formed a subgroup or a [[Sprachbund]]; see [[Thraco-Illyrian]].)

=== (Old) Albanian ===
According to the central hypothesis of a project undertaken by the Austrian Science Fund FWF, Old Albanian had a significant influence on the development of many Balkan languages. Intensive research now aims to confirm this theory. This little-known language is being researched using all available texts before a comparison with other Balkan languages is carried out. The outcome of this work will include the compilation of a lexicon providing an overview of all Old Albanian verbs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-in-practice/project-presentations/2008/old-albanian-living-legacy-of-a-dead-language/  |title=FWF Austrian Science Fund&nbsp;– Press&nbsp;– (Old) Albanian&nbsp;– Living legacy of a dead language? |publisher=Fwf.ac.at |date= |accessdate=22 September 2010}}</ref>{{outdated inline|date=February 2015}}

=== Proto-IE features ===
The demonstrative pronoun ''ko'' is ancestral to Albanian ''ky/kjo'' and English ''he''.

Albanian is compared to other Indo-European languages below, but note that Albanian has exhibited some notable instances of [[semantic drift]] (such as ''motër'' meaning "sister" rather than "mother" or the Latin loans ''gjelbër'' and ''verdhë'' having become switched in meaning).

=== Albanian-PIE phonological correspondences ===

Phonologically Albanian is not so conservative. Like many IE stocks it has merged the two series of voiced stops (e.g. both *''d'' and *''dʰ'' became ''d''). In addition the voiced stops tend to disappear in between vowels. There is almost complete loss of final syllables and very widespread loss of other unstressed syllables (e.g. ''mik'', "friend" from Lat. ''amicus''). PIE *''o'' appears as ''a'' (also as ''e'' if a high front vowel ''i'' follows), while *''ē'' and *''ā'' become ''o'', and PIE *''ō'' appears as ''e''. The palatals, velars, and labiovelars all remain distinct before front vowels, a conservation found otherwise in [[Luvian]] and related Anatolian languages. Thus PIE *''ḱ'', *''k'', and *''kʷ'' become ''th'', ''q'', and ''s'', respectively (before back vowels *''ḱ'' becomes ''th'', while *''k'' and *''kʷ'' merge as ''k'').{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Another remarkable retention is the preservation of initial *''h<sub>4</sub>'' as Alb. ''h'' (all other laryngeals disappear completely).<ref name="ReferenceA">Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture By J. P. Mallory, Douglas Q.

== Dialects ==
{{Main|Albanian dialects}}

Albanian is divided into two major dialects: [[Gheg]], [[Tosk]], and a transitional dialect zone between them.<ref>Gjinari, Jorgji. Dialektologjia shqiptare</ref>
The [[Shkumbin]] river is roughly the dividing line, with Gheg spoken north of the Shkumbin and Tosk south of it.<ref>Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World By Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Contributor Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Edition: illustrated Published by Elsevier, 2008 ISBN 0-08-087774-5, ISBN 978-0-08-087774-7</ref> There are also other dialects like Arbëresh and Arvanitika, which are mixtures between Gheg and Tosk with some archaic features of Albanian. They are spoken in some areas of Italy and Greece.

== Standard Albanian ==

Since [[World War II]], standard Albanian used in Albania has been based on the Tosk dialect. Kosovo and other areas where Albanian is official adopted the Tosk standard in 1969.<ref name="Agim">Agim Morina, "Udhërrëfyes i shkurtë i standardizimit të shqipes," [http://dodonapress.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/udherrefyes-i-shkurte-i-historise-se.html ''DodonaPress'' (2015-02-21)], also in [http://plisi.org/2015/02/24/udherrefyes-shkurte-historise-standardizimit-shqipes/ ''Plisi.org'' (2015-02-24)].</ref>

=== Elbasan-based Standard ===

Until the early 20th century, Albanian writing developed in three main literary traditions: [[Gheg]], [[Tosk]], and [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]. Throughout this time, an intermediate subdialect spoken around [[Elbasan]] served as ''lingua franca'' among the Albanians, but was less prevalent in writing. A congress of Albanian writers held in 1909 recommended the use of the Elbasan subdialect for literary purposes and as a basis of a unified national language. While technically classfied as a southern Gheg variety, the Elbasan speech is closer to Tosk in phonology and practically a hybrid between other Gheg subdialects and literary Tosk.<ref name=Agim />

Between 1916 and 1918, the [[Albanian Literary Commission]] met in Shkodër under the leadership of [[Luigj Gurakuqi]] with the purpose of establishing a unified orthography for the language. The Commission, made up of representatives from the north and south of Albania, reaffirmed the Elbasan subdialect as the basis of a national tongue. The rules published in 1917 defined spelling for the Elbasan variety for official purposes. The Commission did not, however, discourage publications in one of the dialects, but rather laid a foundation for Gheg and Tosk to gradually converge into one.<ref name="Agim"/>

When the Congress of Lushnje met in the aftermath of World War I to form a new Albanian government, the 1917 decisions of the Literary Commission were upheld. The Elbasan subdialect remained in use for administrative purposes and many new writers embraced for creative writing. Gheg and Tosk continued to develop freely and interaction between the two dialects increased.

=== Tosk Standard ===

At the end of World War II, however, the new communist regime radically imposed the use of the Tosk dialect in all facets of life: administration, education, and literature.  Most Communist leaders were Tosks from the south.<ref name="Agim"/> Standardization was directed by the [[Centre of Albanological Studies#Institute of Linguistics and Literature|Institute of Albanian Language and Literature]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]].{{sfn|Lloshi||p=10}} Two dictionaries were published in 1954: an Albanian language dictionary and a [[Russian language|Russian]]–Albanian dictionary. New orthography rules were eventually published in 1967{{sfn|Lloshi||p=10}} and 1973 ''Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe'' (Orthography of the Albanian Language).<ref>{{cite book |title=Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe |last=Kostallari |first=Androkli |authorlink= |year=1973 |publisher="Instituti i Gjuhësisë dhe i Letërsisë" ( in "Akademia e Shkencave e RPS të Shqipërisë", today "Akademia e Shkencave e Republikës së Shqipërisë"), |location= |isbn= |page=  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4LLPwAACAAJ&dq=Drejtshkrimi+i+gjuh%C3%ABs+shqipe|ref="Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe" }}</ref>

=== Calls for Reform ===
{{further|Albanian Orthography Congress}}
Since the fall of the communist regime, Albanian orthography has stirred heated debate among scholars, writers, and public opinion in Albania and Kosovo, with hardliners opposed to any changes in the orthography, moderates supporting varying degrees of reform, and radicals calling for a return to the Elbasan dialect. Criticism of Standard Albanian has centred on the exclusion of the 'me+' infinitive and the Gheg lexicon. Critics say that Standard Albanian disenfranchises and stigmatizes Gheg speakers, affecting the quality of writing and impairing effective public communication. Supporters of the Tosk standard contend view the [[Albanian Orthography Congress|1972 Congress]] as a milestone achievement in Albanian history and dismiss calls for reform as efforts to "divide the nation" or "create two languages." Moderates, who are especially prevalent in Kosovo, generally stress the need for a unified Albanian language, but believe that the 'me+' infinitive and Gheg words should be included. Proponents of the Elbasan dialect have been vocal, but have gathered little support in the public opinion. In general, those involved in the language debate come from diverse backgrounds and there is no significant correlation between one's political views, geographic origin, and position on Standard Albanian.

Many writers have continued to write in the Elbasan dialect, which is somewhat erroneously referred to as Gheg (other Gheg variants have found much more limited use in literature). But most publications adhere to a strict policy of not accepting submissions that are not written in Tosk. Some print media even translate direct speech, replacing the 'me+' infinitive with other verb forms and making other changes in grammar and word choice. Even authors who have published in the Elbasan dialect will frequently write in the Tosk standard.

In the recent years, a group of academics for Albania and Kosovo have proposed minor changes in the orthography. Hardline academics boycotted the initiative, while other reformers have viewed it as superficial. Media such as Rrokum and Java have offered content that is almost exclusively in the Elbasan dialect. Meanwhile, author and linguist [[Agim Morina]] has promoted a reformed version of the Tosk standard that aims at reflecting the natural development of the language among all Albanians. Morina's variant incorporates the 'me+' infinitive, accommodates for Gheg features, and provides for simpler and dialect-neutral rules.

=== Education ===

Albanian is the medium of instruction in most Albanian schools. The literacy rate in Albania for the total population, age 9 or older, is about 99%. Elementary education is compulsory (grades 1–9), but most students continue at least until a secondary education. Students must pass graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade and at the end of the 12th grade in order to continue their education.

== Geographic distribution ==

Albanian is spoken by approximately 5.4 million people,<ref name="e18"/> mainly in [[Demographics of Albania|Albania]], [[Albanians in Kosovo|Kosovo]], [[Ethnic groups in Turkey|Turkey]], the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Albanian communities in Greece|Greece]] and Italy ([[Arbereshe]])<!-- [[Albanians in Serbia proper|Serbia proper]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Albanians of Romania|Romania]] and Bulgaria (in the single village of [[Mandritsa]]) --> and by [[Albanian diaspora|immigrant communities]] in many other countries, notably the [[Ethnic groups in the UK|United Kingdom]], the [[Albanian Americans|United States]], [[Ethnic groups in Germany|Germany]], the [[Ethnic groups in the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and [[Ethnic groups in Switzerland|Switzerland]].

=== Standard ===
Standard Albanian, based on the [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] dialect of southern Albania, is the [[official language]] of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]] and is also official in municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia where ethnic Albanians form more than 20% of the municipal population.<ref>[http://www.president.gov.mk/en/about-macedonia/basic-facts.html]</ref> It is also an official language of [[Montenegro]], where it is spoken in municipalities with ethnic Albanian populations.

== Phonology ==
Standard Albanian has 7 [[vowel]]s and 29 [[consonant]]s. [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] uses [[long vowel|long]] and [[nasal vowel]]s, which are absent in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], and the mid-central vowel ''ë'' is lost at the end of the word. The stress is fixed mainly on the last syllable. Gheg ''n'' (''femën'': compare English ''feminine'') changes to ''r'' by [[rhotacism#Linguistics|rhotacism]] in Tosk (''femër'').

'''Notes:'''

* The contrast between flapped ''r'' and trilled ''rr'' is the same as in Spanish or [[Armenian language|Armenian]].  In most of the dialects, as also in standard Albanian, the single "r" merges from an alveolar flap {{IPA|/ɾ/}} into a retroflex flap {{IPA|[ɽ]}}, or even an alveolar approximant {{IPA|[ɹ]}} when it is at the end of a word.
* The palatal nasal {{IPA|/ɲ/}} corresponds to the Spanish ''ñ'' and the French and Italian ''gn''. It is pronounced as one sound, not a nasal plus a glide.
* The ''ll'' sound is a velarised lateral, close to English ''[[dark L]]''.
* The letter ''ç'' is sometimes written ''ch'' due to technical limitations because of its use in English sound and its analogy to the other [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s ''xh'', ''sh'', and ''zh''. Usually it is written simply ''c'' or more rarely ''q'' with context resolving any ambiguities.
* Many speakers merge the palatal sounds ''q'' and ''gj'' into the palatoalveolar sounds ''ç'' and ''xh''. This is especially common in Northern Gheg, but is increasingly the case in Tosk as well.<ref>Kolgjini, Julie M. (2004).

== Grammar ==
{{see also | Albanian morphology}}
Albanian has a canonical word order of [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] (subject–verb–object) like English and many other Indo-European languages.<ref>Maxwell, Daniel Newhall. (1979). A Crosslinguistic Correlation between Word Order and Casemarking
institution. Bloomington: Indiana University Pub.</ref> Albanian [[noun]]s are [[Albanian morphology|inflected]] by [[Grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine, feminine and neuter) and [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural). There are five [[declension]]s with six cases ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative]], and [[vocative]]), although the vocative only occurs with a limited number of words, and the forms of the genitive and dative are identical (a genitive is produced when the prepositions ''i/e/të/së'' are used with the dative). Some dialects also retain a locative case, which is not present in standard Albanian. The cases apply to both definite and indefinite nouns, and there are numerous cases of [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]].

The following shows the declension of ''mal'' (mountain), a masculine noun which takes "i" in the definite singular:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! '''Indefinite singular''' !! '''Indefinite plural''' !! '''Definite singular''' !! '''Definite plural'''

|-
| '''[[Ablative]]''' || (prej) një zogu || (prej) zogjsh || (prej) zogut || (prej) zogjve
|}

The following table shows the declension of the feminine noun ''vajzë'' (girl):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! '''Indefinite singular''' !! '''Indefinite plural''' !! '''Definite singular''' !! '''Definite plural'''
|-
| '''[[Nominative]]''' || një vajzë (a girl) || vajza (girls) || vajza (the girl) || vajzat (the girls)
|-
| '''[[Accusative]]''' || një vajzë || vajza || vajzën || vajzat

|-
| '''[[Ablative]]''' || (prej) një vajze || (prej) vajzash || (prej) vajzës || (prej) vajzave
|}

The definite article is placed after the noun as in many other [[Balkan languages]], like in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].

* The definite article can be in the form of noun suffixes, which vary with gender and case.
** For example, in singular nominative, masculine nouns add ''-i'', or those ending in -g/-k/-h take ''-u'' (to avoid palatalization):
*** ''mal'' (mountain) / ''mali'' (the mountain);
*** ''libër'' (book) / ''libri'' (the book);
*** ''zog'' (bird) / ''zogu'' (the bird).
** Feminine nouns take the suffix ''-(i/j)a'':
*** ''veturë'' (car) / ''vetura'' (the car);
*** ''shtëpi'' (house) / ''shtëpia'' (the house);
*** ''lule'' (flower) / ''lulja'' (the flower).
* Neuter nouns take ''-t''.

Albanian has developed an analytical [[verb]]al structure in place of the earlier synthetic system, inherited from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. Its complex system of [[Grammatical mood|mood]]s (six types) and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]s (three simple and five complex constructions) is distinctive among [[Balkan languages]]. There are two general types of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]].

Albanian verbs, like those of other Balkan languages, have an "[[admirative]]" mood (''mënyra habitore'') that is used to indicate surprise on the part of the speaker or to imply that an event is known to the speaker by report and not by direct observation. In some contexts, this mood can be translated using English "apparently".

* ''Ti '''flet''' shqip.'' "You '''speak''' Albanian." (indicative)
* ''Ti '''fliske''' shqip!'' "You '''(surprisingly) speak''' Albanian!" (admirative)
* ''Rruga '''është''' e mbyllur.'' "The street '''is''' closed." (indicative)
* ''Rruga '''qenka''' e mbyllur.'' "'''(Apparently,)''' The street '''is''' closed." (admirative)

For more information on verb conjugation and on inflection of other parts of speech, see [[Albanian morphology]].

=== Word order ===
Albanian word order is relatively free [http://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/viewFile/4690/4482]. However, the most common order is [[subject–verb–object]], and negation is expressed by the particles ''nuk'' or ''s''' in front of the verb, for example:

* ''Toni nuk flet anglisht'' "Tony does not speak English";
* ''Toni s'flet anglisht'' "Tony doesn't speak English";
* ''Nuk e di'' "I do not know";
* ''S'e di'' "I don't know".

However, the verb can optionally occur in sentence-initial position, especially with verbs in the non-active form (''forma joveprore''):

* '''''Parashikohet''' një ndërprerje'' "An interruption '''is anticipated'''".

In imperative sentences, the particle ''mos'' is used:

* ''Mos harro'' "do not forget!".
* [[subject–verb–object|SVO]]: Agimi i hëngri të gjithë portokallët.
* [[subject–object–verb|SOV]]: Agimi të gjithë portokallët i hëngri.
* [[Object–verb–subject|OVS]]: Të gjithë portokallët i hëngri Agimi.
* [[Object–subject–verb|OSV]]: Të gjithë portokallët Agimi i hëngri.
* [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]]: I hëngri Agimi të gjithë portokallët.

== Orthography ==
{{Main|Albanian alphabet|Albanian braille}}
[[File:Albanian keyboard layout.jpg|thumb|Albanian [[keyboard layout]].]]

The Albanian language has been written using many different alphabets since the earliest records from the 15th century. The history of Albanian language orthography is closely related to the cultural orientation and knowledge of certain foreign languages among Albanian writers.{{sfn|Lloshi||p=12}} The earliest written Albanian records come from the Gheg area in makeshift spellings based on Italian or Greek and sometimes in Arabic characters. Originally, the Tosk dialect was written in the [[Greek alphabet]] and the Gheg dialect was written in the [[Latin script]]. Both dialects had also been written in the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] version of the [[Arabic script]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and some local alphabets ([[Elbasan alphabet|Elbasan]], [[Vithkuqi alphabet|Büthakukye/Vithkuqi]], Todhri, Veso Bey, Jan Vellara and others, see [[Albanian alphabet#Original Alphabets|original Albanian alphabets]]). More specifically, the writers from northern Albania and under the influence of the Catholic Church used Latin letters, those in southern Albania and under the influence of the Greek Orthodox church used Greek letters, while others throughout Albania and under the influence of Islam used Arabic letters. There were initial attempts to create an original Albanian alphabet during the 1750–1850 period. These attempts intensified after the [[League of Prizren]] and culminated with the [[Congress of Manastir]] held by Albanian intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Manastir (present day [[Bitola]]), which decided on which alphabet to use, and what the standardized spelling would be for standard Albanian. This is how the literary language remains. The alphabet is the Latin alphabet with the addition of the letters ''ë'', ''ç'', and nine [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]].

== Literary tradition ==

=== Earliest undisputed texts ===
{{See also|Formula e pagëzimit|Meshari}}

The earliest known texts in Albanian:
* a 208-page parchment written by Theodor of Shkodra discovered in the secret archives of Vatican [https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=theodor+of+shkodra&source=bl&ots=leUNicZJF0&sig=SSnLa7n_6m-f9jYT7OS2Rft9zJk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMIko-bh-GnxwIVhl2SCh1NvgCm#v=onepage&q=theodor%20of%20shkodra&f=false]. The work is a manuscript decorated with golden miniatures and colored initials, divided in three parts. Pages 1–97 deal with theology, 98–146 with philosophy, and pages 147–208 with a history of the known world from AD 153 to 1209. On the final page of the manuscript we find a note by the author "With the assistance and great love of the blessed Lord, I finished this in the year 1210 on the 9th day of March."
* the "[[formula e pagëzimit]]" (baptismal Formula), which dates back to 1462 and was authored by [[Pal Engjëlli]] (or Paulus Angelus) (c. 1417&nbsp;– 1470), Archbishop of [[Durrës]]. Engjëlli was a close friend and counsellor of [[Skanderbeg]].{{sfn|Prifti|1982|p=3}} It was written in a pastoral letter for a synod at the Holy Trinity in Mat and read in Latin characters as follows: ''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et Spertit Senit'' (standard Albanian: "Unë të pagëzoj në emër të Atit, të Birit e të Shpirtit të Shenjtë" "I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit"). It was discovered and published in 1915 by [[Nicolae Iorga]].{{sfn|Iorga|1s971|p=102}}
* the ''[[Fjalori i Arnold von Harfit]]'' ([[Arnold Ritter von Harff's lexicon]]), a short list of Albanian phrases with German glosses, dated 1496.{{sfn|Anamali|2002|p=311}}
* a song, recorded in the Greek alphabet, retrieved from an old [[codex]] that was written in Greek. The document is also called ''Perikopeja e Ungjillit të Pashkëve" or "Perikopeja e Ungjillit të Shën Mateut'' ("The Song of the Easter Gospel, or "The Song of Saint Matthew's Gospel"). Although the codex is dated to during the 14th century, the song, written in Albanian by an anonymous writer, seems to be a 16th-century writing. The document was found by [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] people who had emigrated to [[Italy]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=97}}

[[File:Buzuku meshari.jpg|left|thumb|[[Meshari]] of [[Gjon Buzuku]] 1554–1555]]

The first book in Albanian is the [[Meshari]] ("The Missal"), written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] between 20 March 1554 and 5 January 1555. The book was written in the [[Gheg]] dialect in the [[Latin script]] with some Slavic letters adapted for Albanian vowels. The book was discovered in 1740 by [[Gjon Nikollë Kazazi]], the Albanian [[archbishop]] of [[Skopje]]. It contains the liturgies of the main [[holiday]]s. There are also texts of prayers and rituals and [[catechism|catechetical]] texts. The grammar and the vocabulary are more archaic than those in the Gheg texts from the 17th century. The 188 pages of the book comprise about 154,000 words with a total vocabulary of c. 1,500 different words. The text is archaic yet easily interpreted because it is mainly a translation of known texts, in particular portions of the [[Bible]]. The book also contains passages from the [[Psalm]]s, the [[Book of Isaiah]], the [[Book of Jeremiah]], the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Letters to the Corinthians]], and many illustrations. The uniformity of spelling seems to indicate an earlier tradition of writing. The only known copy of the Meshari is held by the [[Vatican Library|Apostolic Library]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Meshari | url=http://www.bksh.al/gsdl/cgi-bin/library.exe?e=d-01000-00---off-0antikuar--00-1--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-about---00-3-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&a=d&c=antikuar&cl=CL2.3 | work= | publisher=[[National Library of Albania]] | author= | date= | accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> In 1968 the book was published with transliterations and comments by linguists.

=== Disputed earlier text ===

[[File:Oldest Surviving Albanian Text.jpg|thumb|right|Possibly the oldest surviving Albanian text, highlighted in red, from the Bellifortis manuscript, written by Konrad Kyeser around 1402–1405.]]

In 1967 two scholars claimed to have found a brief text in Albanian inserted into the [[Bellifortis]] text, a book written in Latin dating to 1402–1405.{{sfn|Todericiu|1967|}}

{{quote|"A star has fallen in a place in the woods, distinguish the star, distinguish it.<br>
Distinguish the star from the others, they are ours, they are.<br>
Do you see where the great voice has resounded? Stand beside it<br>
That thunder. It did not fall. It did not fall for you, the one which would do it.<br>
...<br>
Like the ears, you should not believe ... that the moon fell when ...<br>
Try to encompass that which spurts far ...<br>
Call the light when the moon falls and no longer exists ..."}}

Dr. [[Robert Elsie]], a specialist in Albanian studies, considers that "The Todericiu/Polena Romanian translation of the non-Latin lines, although it may offer some clues if the text is indeed Albanian, is fanciful and based, among other things, on a false reading of the manuscript, including the exclusion of a whole line."{{sfn|Elsie|1986|p=158–162}}

=== Ottoman period ===

In 1635, [[Frang Bardhi]] (1606–1643) published in [[Rome]] his ''Dictionarum latinum-epiroticum'', the first known Latin-Albanian dictionary. Other scholars who studied the language during the 17th century include [[Andrea Bogdani]] (1600–1685), author of the first Latin-Albanian grammar book, [[Nilo Katalanos]] (1637–1694) and others.{{sfn|Marmullaku|1975|p=17}}

=== Early Greek loans ===
There are some 30 [[Ancient Greek]] loanwords in Albanian.<ref name="Linguistics p.412"/> Many of these reflect a dialect which voiced its aspirants, as did the Macedonian dialect. Other loanwords are Doric; these words mainly refer to commodity items and trade goods and probably came through trade with a now-extinct intermediary.<ref name="huld"/>
* bletë; "hive, bee" < Attic ''mélitta'' "bee" (vs. Ionic ''mélissa'').<ref>Vladimir Orel (2000) postulates a Vulgar Latin intermediary for no good reason. Mallory & Adams (1997) erroneously give the word as native, from *''melítiā'', the protoform underlying Greek ''mélissa''; however, this protoform gave Albanian ''mjalcë'' "bee", which is a natural derivative of Proto-Albanian *''melita'' "honey" (mod. ''mjaltë'').</ref>

=== Gothic loans ===

Some [[Gothic language|Gothic]] loanwords were borrowed through [[Late Latin]], while others came from the Ostrogothic expansion into parts of Praevalitana around Nakšić and the Gulf of Kotor in Montenegro.

* fat; "groom, husband" < Goth ''brūþ'''faþ'''s'' "bridegroom"<ref>The word ''fat'' has both the meaning of "fate, luck" and "groom, husband". This may indicate two separate words that are homophones, one derived from Gothic and the other from Latin ''fātum''; although, Orel (2000) sees them as the same word. Similarly, compare Albanian ''shortë'' "fate; spouse, wife" which mirrors the dichotomy in meaning of ''fat'' but is considered to stem from one single source—Latin ''sortem'' "fate".</ref>
* horr; "scoundrel", horrë; "hussy, whore" < Goth ''hors'' "adulterer", *''hora'' "whore"{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* shkulkë; "boundary marker for pastures made of branches" < Late Latin ''sculca'' < Goth ''skulka'' "guardian"{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* shkumë; "foam" < Late Latin < Goth ''skūma''{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* tirq; "trousers" < Late Latin ''tubrucus'' < Goth *''þiobrok'' "knee-britches"; cf. OHG ''dioh-bruoh'', Eng thigh, breeches{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The earliest accepted document in the Albanian language is from the 15th century. It is assumed that [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and [[Balkan Latin]] (which was the ancestor of Romanian and other Balkan Romance languages) would exert a great influence on Albanian. Examples of words borrowed from Latin: ''qytet < civitas'' (city), ''qiell < caelum'' (sky), ''mik < amicus'' (friend).

After the [[Slavs]] arrived in the [[Balkans]], the [[Slavic languages]] became an additional source of loanwords. The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] meant an influx of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words; this also entailed the borrowing of Persian and Arabic words through Turkish. Many Albanian names (such as [[Enver Hoxha]]) are of Turkish origin. Some loanwords from Modern Greek also exist especially in the south of Albania. A lot of the borrowed words have been re-substituted from Albanian rooted words or modern Latinized (international) words.
