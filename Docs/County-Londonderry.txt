''' County Londonderry''', also known as '''County Derry''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Contae Dhoire'', [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]]: ''Coontie Lunnonderrie''), is one of the six [[Counties of Northern Ireland|counties]] of [[Northern Ireland]]. Adjoining the north-west shore of [[Lough Neagh]], the county covers an area of 2,074&nbsp;km² (801 sq mi) and has a population of about 247,132. It is also one of the nine (of a total of thirty-two) traditional [[counties of Ireland]], lying within the historic [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Ulster]].

Since 1981, it has become one of four counties in Northern Ireland that has a [[Irish Catholic|Catholic]] majority (55.56% according to the 2001 Census<ref name="NISRA">[http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/Census/pdf/Key%20Statistics%20ReportTables.pdf 2001 Census Statistics]</ref>), with 57% of the Catholic population residing within [[Derry City Council]].<ref name="NISRA"/> The [[county flower]] is the [[Purple Saxifrage]].<ref>[http://www.plantlife.org.uk/uk/plantlife-discovering-plants-county-flowers.html County flowers in Britain] www.plantlife.org.uk</ref>

== Name ==
The place name ''Derry'' is an [[anglicisation]] of the old Irish ''Daire''<ref>{{cite book|last=Delanoy|first=Werner|title=Towards a Dialogic Anglistics|publisher=LIT Verlag|year=2007|page=38|isbn=978-3-8258-0549-4|display-authors=etal}}</ref> (Modern Irish ''Doire''<ref>[http://focal.ie/Search.aspx?term=doire Dictionary of Irish Terms – Foclóir Téarmaíochta]. focal.ie. Retrieved on 23 July 2013.</ref>), meaning "oak-grove" or "oak-wood".<ref>{{cite book|last=Blackie|first=Christina|title=Geographical Etymology|publisher=Marton Press|year=2010|page=61|isbn=978-1-4455-8286-3}}</ref>

As with the city, its name is subject to the [[Derry/Londonderry name dispute]], with the form "Londonderry" generally preferred by [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]] and "Derry" by [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]].<ref>[http://www.ceps.eu/Article.php?article_id=206 Centre for European Policy Studies, accessed 6 October 2007]</ref><ref name="Maiden">{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=1588|title=The Walled City Experience|publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board|accessdate=4 September 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4887352.stm BBC News: Court to Rule on City Name] 7 April 2006</ref><ref>''City name row lands in High Court'' [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6213890.stm BBC News]</ref><ref>{{cite BAILII |litigants=Derry City Council: Re Application for Judicial Review |link= |country=nie |court=NIHC |division=QB |year=2007 |num=5 |para= |eucase= |parallelcite= |date= |courtname= |juris= }}</ref>

Most British authorities use the name "Londonderry", while "Derry" is used by the [[Republic of Ireland]].

[[Mount Sandel Mesolithic site|Mountsandel]] located near Coleraine in County Londonderry is "perhaps the oldest recorded settlement within Ireland".<ref>A.E.P.

[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Celtic_Sea?topic=49523 ''Celtic Sea''. Encyclopedia of Earth. Eds. P. Saundry & C.J. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC]</ref> At an early period, the county was inhabited by the [[Ó Catháin]]s, who were tributary to the [[O'Neill dynasty|O'Neills]]. Towards the close of the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] the county was seized by England, with the purpose of checking the power of the O'Neills, and it received the name of [[Coleraine]], as that town was its capital. In 1609, the citizens of [[London]] obtained possession of the towns of Londonderry and Coleraine.<ref>{{EB1911|inline=1|title=Londonderry |volume=16 |pages=972-973  |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri16chisrich#page/972/mode/2up}}</ref>

Unlike the town, governmentally there was not a preceding administrative area called County Derry. Rather County Londonderry was created by [[James I of England|James I]] when he gave a charter to the [[The Honourable The Irish Society|Irish Society]] to undertake the new county's plantation – the London prefix being added in reference to the London [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]] of the Irish Society. This charter is dated 29 March 1613,<ref name="Munn">''Notes on the Place Names of the Parishes and Townlands of the County of Londonderry'', 1925, Alfred Moore Munn, Clerk of the Crown and Peace of the City and County of Londonderry</ref> and declared that the "City of Londonderry" and everything contained within:
{{cquote|
shall be united, consolidated, and from hence-forth for ever be one entire County of itself, distinct and separate from all our Counties whatsoever within our Kingdom of Ireland-and from henceforth for ever be named, accounted and called, the County of Londonderry.<ref name="Munn"/>
}}

This new county would comprise the then County Coleraine, which consisted of the baronies of Tirkeeran, Coleraine, and Keenaght; all but the south-west corner of the barony of Loughinsholin, which was then a part of County Tyrone; the North East Liberties of Coleraine, which was part of County Antrim; and the City of Londonderry and the Liberties, which were in County Donegal.<ref name="Munn"/><ref name="ANHOI">[https://books.google.com/books?id=94hgYO8I6T0C&pg=PA111 A New History of Ireland, pages 111–112]</ref> The Liberties of Coleraine and Londonderry were requested by the Irish society so that they could control both banks of the mouths of the [[River Foyle]] and the [[River Bann]], and Loughinsholin to have access to sufficient wood for construction.<ref name="Curl">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/plantation/companies/londoncompanies_full.rtf|title=The City of London and the Plantation of Ulster|last=Curl|first=James Stevens|year=2001|publisher=BBCi History Online|accessdate=10 August 2008}}</ref>

From [[Walter Harris (historian)|Harris]]'s ''Hibernica'', and also from Captain Pynnar's ''Survey of the Escheated Counties of Ulster, Anno 1618'':

{{cquote|
The county of [[Coleraine]],* otherwise called [[O'Cahan]]'s country, is divided, as Tyrone, by ballyboes and doth contain, as appeareth by the survey, 547 ballyboes, or 34,187 acres, every ballyboe containing 60 acres or thereabouts.
}}

English control of the territory remained nominal until the [[Flight of the Earls]] in 1607, which saw the earls territory—spanning almost the entire county—escheated to [[the Crown]]. In 1609 the territory was given to the [[City of London Corporation]] and its [[livery company|livery companies]], who received instructions to undertake its [[plantation of Ulster|plantation]]. The area for planting included:

* the entirety of County Coleraine
* the barony of Loughinsholin which comprised the then north of [[County Tyrone]] and the environs of Coleraine in [[County Antrim]], together called [[O'Cahan]]'s Country
* a small area of [[County Donegal]] around [[Lough Foyle]]

In 1613, this larger area became incorporated into the newly founded County Londonderry, with its [[county town]] in the new walled city of [[Derry]] (also founded in 1613) on the west bank of the Foyle, opposite the destroyed town of Derry.

As a result of the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]], the city was detached from the county for administrative purposes, becoming a separate [[county borough]] from 1899.  The [[county town]] of County Londonderry, and seat of the Londonderry County Council until its abolition in 1973, was therefore moved to the town of [[Coleraine]].

[[File:Downhill Strand, Derry - Londonderry - geograph.org.uk - 1124323.jpg|thumbnail|Downhill Strand.]]
[[File:Benone Strand.jpg|thumb|Benone Strand, Northern Ireland]]
The highest point in the county is the summit of [[Sawel Mountain]] ({{convert|678|m|ft|0}}) on the border with [[County Tyrone]]. Sawel is part of the [[Sperrin Mountains]], which dominate the southern part of the county. To the east and west, the land falls into the valleys of the [[River Bann|Bann]] and [[River Foyle|Foyle]] rivers respectively; in the south-east, the county touches the shore of Lough Neagh, which is the largest lake in Ireland; the north of the county is distinguished by the steep cliffs, dune systems, and remarkable beaches of the Atlantic coast.

The county is home to a number of important buildings and landscapes, including the well-preserved 17th-century [[city wall]]s of [[Derry]]; the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]–owned [[Plantation of Ulster|Plantation]] [[Springhill House|estate at Springhill]]; [[Mussenden Temple]] with its spectacular views of the Atlantic; the [[Dike (construction)|dikes]], artificial coastlines and the noted [[Bird sanctuary|bird sanctuaries]] on the eastern shore of [[Lough Foyle]]; and the visitor centre at [[Bellaghy]] Bawn, close to the childhood home of Nobel laureate [[Seamus Heaney]]. In the centre of the county are the old-growth deciduous forests at Banagher and Ness Wood, where the Burntollet River flows over the highest waterfalls in Northern Ireland.

== Administration ==
In 1973 counties ceased to be a unit of administration within Northern Ireland, being replaced by [[Local government in Northern Ireland|district councils]].

[[Derry City Council]], [[Limavady Borough Council]], and [[Magherafelt District Council]] all fall within County Londonderry's boundaries.  Most of [[Coleraine Borough Council]] also covers an area within the county (the remainder being in [[County Antrim]]), as well as a part of [[Cookstown District Council]] (most of which covers an area in [[County Tyrone]]).

== Railways ==
[[File:Downhill Railway Runnel - geograph.org.uk - 1197950.jpg|thumb|Downhill Tunnels near [[Castlerock railway station]].]]

[[Translink (Northern Ireland)|Translink]] provides a [[Northern Ireland Railways]] service in the county, linking [[Londonderry Waterside railway station]] to [[Coleraine railway station]] (with a branch to {{stnlnk|Portrush}} on the [[Coleraine–Portrush railway line]]) and onwards into County Antrim to [[Belfast Central railway station|Belfast Central]] and [[Belfast Great Victoria Street railway station|Belfast Great Victoria Street]] on the [[Belfast-Derry railway line]].

There is also the [[Foyle Valley Railway]], a museum in [[Derry]] with some rolling stock from both the [[County Donegal Railway]] and the [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]], and is located on the site of the former [[Londonderry Foyle Road railway station]]. The [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]] continued as a private bus company based in the city but operating predominantly in [[County Donegal]] until it closed in 2014. Bus services are now provided by [[Ulsterbus]].

== Education ==
Government-funded education up to secondary school level is administered by

* [[Western Education and Library Board]]: Derry, Limavady
* [[North Eastern Education and Library Board]]: Coleraine, Magherafelt
* [[Southern Education and Library Board]]: Cookstown

For Catholic grant-maintained schools administration is by the Derry Diocesan Education Office.

Two major centres of the [[University of Ulster]] are in the county, including its headquarters at [[University of Ulster at Coleraine|Coleraine]] and the [[Magee College|Magee Campus]] in Derry.

== Sport ==
[[File:Tammetõru.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The oak leaf which represents the county's [[List of Irish county nicknames|nickname]].]]
In [[Gaelic Athletic Association|Gaelic games]], the [[GAA county]] of [[Derry GAA|Derry]] is more or less coterminous with the former administrative county of Londonderry, although teams from the neighbouring counties of Tyrone, Donegal and Antrim have occasionally played in Derry competitions, and vice versa. The Derry teams wear the colours red and white. There are many club teams competing in up to five leagues and three championships. The county team has won one [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] (in [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1993|1993]]) and five [[National Football League (Ireland)|National League titles]]. [[Hurling]] is also widely played but is not as popular as football.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} However, the county team is generally regarded as one of the top hurling sides in [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship|Ulster]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} and in [[Nicky Rackard Cup 2006|2006]] won the [[Nicky Rackard Cup]] – the third tier hurling competition in Ireland.

In association football, the [[NIFL Premiership]], which operates as the top division, has two teams in the county: [[Coleraine F.C.]] and [[Institute F.C.]], with [[Limavady United F.C.]], [[Moyola Park F.C.]], [[Portstewart F.C.]] and [[Tobermore United F.C.]] competing in the [[NIFL Championship]], which operates as levels two and three. [[Derry City F.C.]] play in the [[League of Ireland Premier Division|Premier Division]] of the [[League of Ireland]] after leaving the [[Irish Football Association|Northern Ireland]] structures in 1985, having resigned from the [[NIFL Premiership|Irish Football League]] at the height of [[the Troubles]] because of not being allowed play their home games at the [[Brandywell]] due to security concerns from other clubs.

The [[Northern Ireland Milk Cup]] was established in 1983 and is regarded as one of the most prestigious youth football tournaments in Europe and the world.<ref>[http://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport-in-the-community/MILK-CUP-FOOTBALL-Toyota-sponsor.4327762.jp Newsletter.co.uk]</ref><ref>[http://www.nimilkcup.org/?tabindex=5&tabid=2389 NI Milk Cup Official Site]</ref><ref>[http://www.manutd.com Manchester United Official Website]</ref><ref>[http://www.uicflames.com/sports/m-soccer/spec-rel/072809aac.html University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)]</ref> The competition is based at [[Coleraine]] and involves several other towns and villages in the county – [[Limavady]], [[Portstewart]] and [[Castlerock]] – and in neighbouring [[County Antrim]] – [[Ballymoney]], [[Portrush]], [[Ballymena]] and [[Broughshane]]. The event, held in the last week of July, has attracted teams from 56 countries around the world including Europe, the USA, Africa, the Far East, South America, the Middle East, Australia, Russia, New Zealand and Canada. Some of the biggest teams in the world have entered including Premiership giants [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] as well as top European teams such as [[Feyenoord]], [[F.C. Porto]], [[FC Barcelona]], [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], [[Bayern Munich]] and [[Dynamo Kiev]].

In [[rugby union]], the county is represented at senior level by [[Rainey Old Boys Rugby Club, Magherafelt]] who compete in the Ulster Senior League and All Ireland Division Three. Limavady R.F.C, [[City of Derry Rugby Club]], Londonderry Y.M.C.A and Coleraine Rugby Club all compete in Ulster Qualifying League One.

[[Cricket]] is particularly popular in the north-west of Ireland, with 11 of the 20 senior clubs in the North West Cricket Union located in County Londonderry: Limavady, [[Eglinton Cricket Club|Eglinton]], Glendermott, Brigade, Killymallaght, Ardmore, Coleraine, Bonds Glen, Drummond, Creevedonnell and The Nedd.

In [[rowing (sport)|rowing]], Richard Archibald from [[Coleraine]] along with his Irish team-mates qualified for the Beijing 2008 Olympics by finishing second in the lightweight fours final in Poznań, thus qualifying for the Beijing 2008 Olympics. Another Coleraine rower [[Alan Campbell (sculler)|Alan Campbell]] is a World Cup gold medallist in the single sculls in 2006.

== Media ==
The county currently has four main radio stations:

* [[BBC Radio Foyle]]
* [[Q102.9]]
* [[Q97.2]]
* [[Six FM]] (in the south of the county)
