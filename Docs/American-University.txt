==History==

===Founding===
[[File:American University Glover Gate.jpg|thumb|The front gate at American University.]]

The American University was established in the District of Columbia by an Act of Congress on December 5, 1892, primarily due to the efforts of Methodist bishop [[John Fletcher Hurst]].

After more than three decades devoted principally to securing financial support, the university was officially dedicated on May 15, 1914. The first instruction began on October 6 of that year, when 28 students were enrolled (19 of them graduate students, nine of them special students who were not candidates for a degree). The First Commencement, at which no degrees were awarded, was held on June 2, 1915. The Second Annual Commencement was held on June 2, 1916 where the first degrees (one master's degree and two doctor's degrees) were awarded.

[[File:AU McKineyHall ACC.jpeg|thumb|Birthplace of Army Chemical Corps]]
Shortly after these early commencement ceremonies, classes were interrupted by war. During World War I, the university allowed the U.S. military to use some of its grounds for testing. In 1917, the U.S. military divided American University into two segments, [[Camp American University]] and [[Camp Leach]]. Camp American University became the birthplace of the United States' chemical weapons program, and chemical weapons were tested on the grounds; this required a major cleanup effort in the 1990s. Camp Leach was home to advanced research, development and testing of modern camouflage techniques. {{As of|2014}}, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] is still removing ordnance including [[mustard gas]] and [[mortar shell]]s.

During the next ten years, instruction was offered at the graduate level only, in accordance with the original plan of the founders. In the fall of 1925, the College of Liberal Arts (subsequently named the [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]) was established. Since that date, the University has offered both undergraduate and graduate degrees and programs. In 1934, the [[American University School of Public Affairs|School of Public Affairs]] was founded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spa.american.edu/pages.php?ID=12 |title=The School of Public Affairs at American University |publisher=Spa.american.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref>

During World War II, the campus again offered its services to the U.S. government and became home to the U.S. Navy Bomb Disposal School and a WAVE barracks. For AU's role in these wartime efforts, the [[Victory ship]] [[SS American Victory|SS ''American Victory'']] was named in honor of the university.

===1949–1990===
[[File:President Kennedy American University Commencement Address June 10, 1963.jpg|thumb|President [[John F. Kennedy]] delivers the [[wikisource:A Strategy of Peace|commencement address at American University]], June 10, 1963]]

The present structure of the university began to emerge in 1949. The [[Washington College of Law]] became part of the University in that year, having begun in 1896 as the first coeducational institution for the professional study of law in the District of Columbia. Shortly thereafter, three departments were reorganized as schools: the School of Business Administration in 1955 (subsequently named the Robert P. and Arlene R. Kogod College of Business Administration and in 1999 renamed the [[Kogod School of Business]]); the School of Government and Public Administration in 1957; and the [[School of International Service]] in 1958.

In the early 1960s, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operated a think tank under the guise of [[Operation Camelot]] at American University. The government abandoned the think tank after the operation came to public attention. AU's political intertwinement was furthered by President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s Spring 1963 [[American University Speech|commencement address]].<ref>[http://www.american.edu/media/speeches/Kennedy.htm "1963 Commencement"] June 10, 1963. Retrieved February 5, 2007.</ref> In the speech, Kennedy called on the Soviet Union to work with the United States to achieve a nuclear test ban treaty and to reduce the considerable international tensions and the specter of nuclear war during that juncture of the [[Cold War]].

From 1965 to 1977, the College of Continuing Education existed as a degree-granting college with responsibility for on- and off-campus adult education programs. The Lucy Webb Hayes School of Nursing provided undergraduate study in Nursing from 1965 until 1988. In 1972, the School of Government and Public Administration, the [[School of International Service]], the Center for Technology and Administration, and the Center for the Administration of Justice (subsequently named the School of Justice) were incorporated into the College of Public and International Affairs.

The University bought the Immaculata Campus in 1986 to alleviate space problems. This would later become Tenley Campus.

In 1986, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports and Convocation Center began. Financed with $5 million from and named for Saudi Arabian Trustee [[Adnan Khashoggi]], the building was intended to update athletics facilities and provide a new arena, as well as a parking garage and office space for administrative services. Costing an estimated $19 million, the building represented the largest construction project to date, but met protest by both faculty and students to the University's use of Khashoggi's name on the building due to his involvement in international arms trade.<ref>NBC Evening News for Sunday, 11 January 1987</ref>

In 1988, the College of Public and International Affairs was reorganized to create two free-standing schools: the [[School of International Service]] and the [[American University School of Public Affairs|School of Public Affairs]], incorporating the School of Government and Public Administration and the School of Justice. That same year, construction on the Adnan Khashoggi Sports Center completed while the [[Iran-Contra Affair]] controversy was at its height although his name remained on the building until after Khashoggi defaulted on his donation obligation in the mid to late 1990s.

===1990–present===
[[File:AU Flag.jpg|thumb|upright|The American University flag]]

The [[American University School of Communication|School of Communication]] became independent from the [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] in 1993.

In 1997, [[American University of Sharjah]], the only coeducational, liberal arts university in the [[United Arab Emirates]], signed a two-year contract with AU to provide academic management, a contract which has since been extended multiple times through August 2009. A team of senior AU administrators relocated to [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]] to assist in the establishment of the university and guide it through the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]] accreditation process.

In 2003, American launched the largest fund raising campaign in its history. The program, ''ANewAU'',<ref>[http://www.american.edu/anewau/index.cfm "A New AU"]. Retrieved February 5, 2007.</ref> has a goal of raising $200 million. As of October 2009, the University had raised $189.6 million. When the campaign is completed, the University's website stated that it would "help to attract and retain the finest faculty, increase scholarship support, create and endow research and policy centers, ensure state-of-the-art resources in all of our schools and colleges, expand global programs, and secure the long-term financial health of the university by boosting the endowment."<ref>"Why a new AU", inactive webpage at ''american.anewau.gov-library.us''. Retrieved February 18, 2008.</ref>

In the fall of 2005, the new [[Katzen Arts Center]] opened.

[[Benjamin Ladner]] was suspended from his position as president of the university on August 24, 2005, pending an investigation into possible misuse of university funds for his personal expenses. University faculty passed votes of no confidence in President Ladner on September 26.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/26/AR2005092601801.html?sub=AR "AU Faculty Members Vote No Confidence in Ladner"] ''Washington Post.''

Ground was broken for the new [[School of International Service]] building on November 14, 2007 and completed in 2010. A speech was given by Senator [[Daniel K. Inouye]] (D-HI).

Dr. Neil Kerwin announced he would retire as AU's president when his current contract expired in May 2017.

Additionally, AU owns several other buildings in the [[Tenleytown]] and [[Spring Valley, Washington, D.C.|Spring Valley]], and [[American University Park]] areas.

[[File:American University.webm|thumb|American University]]The first design for campus was done by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] but was significantly modified over time due to financial constraints. The campus occupies 84&nbsp;[[acre]]s (340,000&nbsp;m²) adjacent to [[Ward Circle]], the intersection of Nebraska and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Massachusetts Avenues]]. AU's campus is predominantly surrounded by the affluent residential neighborhoods characteristic of the [[Washington DC (northwest)|Northwest Quadrant]] of Washington, D.C. The  campus includes a main quadrangle surrounded by academic buildings, nine residential halls, a 5,000-seat arena, and an outdoor [[amphitheatre]]. The campus has been designated a public garden and [[arboretum]] by the American Public Garden Association, with many foreign and exotic plants and trees dotting the landscape.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/16/AR2008101601347.html American University].

==Academic organization==

The university is composed of seven divisions, referred to as colleges or schools, which house its academic programs: [[American University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] (CAS), [[Kogod School of Business]] (KSB), [[American University School of Communication|School of Communication]] (SOC), [[School of International Service]] (SIS), [[American University School of Public Affairs|School of Public Affairs]] (SPA), [[School of Professional & Extended Studies]] (SPExS) and [[Washington College of Law]] (WCL). With the exception of WCL, undergraduate and graduate courses are housed within the same division, although organized into different programs.

American University is also home to a unique program known as the [[Washington Semester]] Program. This program partners with institutions around the world to bring students to AU for a semester. The program operates as part of the [[School of Professional & Extended Studies]]. The program combines two seminar courses on three days a week with a two-day-per-week internship that gives students a unique look at Washington, D.C. The program is unique in that the courses are not typical lecture courses; instead, speakers from various sectors of a particular field are invited to address the class, often from different perspectives.<ref>[http://www.washingtonsemester.com/ "Washington Semester at American University"]. Retrieved February 5, 2007.</ref>

In the ''Chronicle of Higher Education'' survey of college presidents' salaries for 2007–08, President [[Cornelius M. Kerwin]] was fifth highest in the nation with a compensation of $1.4 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ex-president of GWU lead in pay survey|date=November 2, 2009|work=Washington Post|page=B1|first=Daniel|last=De Vise}}</ref>

The Jack I. and Dorothy G. Bender Library and Learning Resources Center is the main library facility for the campus. A branch Music Library is located in the Katzen Art Center. The Pence Law Library, part of AU's Washington College of Law, operates separately from the main library system. The University Library is part of the Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC), which includes seven other libraries. The WRLC operates a consortium loan service between member institutions and has a shared collections site in Upper Marlboro, Maryland.

The Bender Library provides a variety of individual and group study spaces and includes a Curriculum Materials Center, a New Media Center, Graduate Research Center, classrooms, and a café. About 160 public computer workstations are available throughout the Bender building and researchers also may borrow laptops, chargers, tablets, and other electronic devices. In October 2012, the library acquired a large poster printer which researchers may use for presentations and other academic purposes.

The Library's Archives and Special Collections houses unique and rare materials and information on the history of the institution. The University Archives is the repository for papers and other documents, including sound recordings and photographs, spanning more than a century of the University's history. Special Collections houses rare materials. Among the more important holdings are the [[Artemas Martin]] collection of mathematical texts, the Charles Nelson Spinks collection of artistic and historical works of Japan, the Irwin M. Heine collection of literary works, and Christopher Johnson collection of William Faulkner books. Playbills form a significant set of the collections with the James Carroll and Iris Lipkowitz collections most notable among them. Other significant collections include the Barlett & Steele Archive, the John R. Hickman Collection, the Friends of Colombia Archives, the Records of the National Peace Corps Association, the Records of the National Commission on the Public Service, the Sally L.

==Athletics==
{{main|American Eagles}}{{advert|section|date=January 2015}}A member of the [[Patriot League]], AU is home to a wide variety of athletics, including men's and women’s [[basketball]], [[soccer]], [[Cross country running|cross-country]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] & [[diving]], [[Track and field|track]], women's [[volleyball]], [[field hockey]], and [[lacrosse]], along with men's [[collegiate wrestling|wrestling]], not to mention several club sports such as rugby, rowing, ice hockey, field hockey, and ultimate frisbee. AU at one time had a football team; their last season was in 1941.

[[Bender Arena]], a state-of-the-art multi-purpose facility, hosts many of American’s athletic competitions. [[Bender Arena]] officially opened its doors on January 23, 1988, when AU's women's basketball team hosted [[James Madison University]].

Reeves Field, home to AU's soccer team, is one of the premier soccer fields in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Reeves Field earned the 2002 College Soccer Field of the Year by the Sports Turf Managers Association, hosted its fifth [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Tournament game, and served as the training site for the [[Uruguayan national football team]]. [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] used Reeves Field as a training facility. In the summer of 2000, AU served as the practice site for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], one of England's premier professional soccer clubs. Major League Soccer's D.C. United, Miami Fusion and San Jose Earthquakes have also practiced at AU. National teams from the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Portugal]] trained at Reeves in 1996 in preparation for [[Summer Olympic]] games held at [[RFK Stadium]].
[[File:AUField.JPG|thumb|Reeves Field – AU]]

Reeves Field also features a six-lane track to accommodate the track and field programs at AU and functions as a multi-purpose event site. During his term as Vice President, [[George H. W. Bush]] regularly traveled in the morning from his home at the [[U.S. Naval Observatory]], located about two miles (3&nbsp;km) from American University, to run the track at Reeves Field.

AU's nationally ranked field hockey and women's lacrosse teams play on the field at the Jacobs Recreational Complex, which also features a softball diamond and two outdoor sand volleyball courts. AU's field hockey team earned the right to host the 2005 Patriot League Tournament, where American defeated [[Lehigh University]] 7–0 in the semifinals before capturing the league crown for the third straight year by downing [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] 4–2 in the Championship Game.

American University features seven outdoor tennis courts for the use of the intercollegiate tennis teams as well as the University community. Two outdoor basketball courts complete the outdoor recreational facility located next to Reeves Field and behind [[Bender Arena]]. AU has hosted three of the last four tennis team championships since joining the Patriot League, with the men's team winning back-to-back titles on the AU hardcourts and setting Patriot League Championship attendance records each year. The women's team last captured the Patriot League title in 2002. Both tennis teams have since been cut from the athletics program.

In 2007, AU Junior Josh Glenn won the NCAA Division I National Wrestling Title for {{convert|197|lb|abbr=on}}. This was the first time since 1966 that an AU athlete won a national championship.

On March 14, 2008, AU earned its first NCAA Tournament berth in men's basketball by defeating [[Colgate University]] in the Patriot League Championship Game. However, AU lost its first-round NCAA tournament game against the [[University of Tennessee]]. On March 13, 2009 AU's men's basketball team repeated as Patriot League Champion by defeating Holy Cross 73–57, earning an automatic bid to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. They ultimately lost to [[Villanova University]] in the first round on March 19, 2009 with a final score of 80–67.

For the spring semester of 2009, AU men's swimming and diving team posted a 3.54 GPA, the highest team grade-point average of all Division I swimming and diving programs according to the Collegiate Swim Coaches Association of American (CSCAA).<ref>[http://www.aueagles.com/sports/c-swim/2008-09/releases/20090708a American University Athletics].

In 2011, AU's wrestling team placed 5th at the 2011 NCAA Division 1 Wrestling Championship, the highest AU Wrestling have ever placed in school history. In addition, HWT Wrestler Ryan Flores made it to the NCAA Finals, the 2nd time in school history to ever make it to the NCAA Finals. American University's wrestling program is a member of the [[EIWA]], as the Patriot League is a non-wrestling conference.
