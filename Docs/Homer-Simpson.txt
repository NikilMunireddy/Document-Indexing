'''Homer Jay Simpson''' is the protagonist of the American animated [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as the patriarch of the [[Simpson family|eponymous family]]. He is voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]] and first appeared on television, along with the rest of his family, in ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' [[The Simpsons shorts|short]] "[[Good Night (The Simpsons short)|Good Night]]" on April 19, 1987. Homer was created and designed by cartoonist [[Matt Groening]] while he was waiting in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip ''[[Life in Hell]]'' but instead decided to create a new set of characters. He named the character after his father, Homer Groening. After appearing for three seasons on ''The Tracey Ullman Show'', the Simpson family got their own series on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] that debuted December 17, 1989.

Homer and his wife [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] have three children: [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. As the family's provider, he works at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. Homer embodies several American [[working class]] [[stereotype]]s: he is a crude, bald, overweight, incompetent, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is essentially a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family. Despite the [[suburb]]an [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] routine of his life, he has had a number of remarkable experiences.

In the shorts and earlier episodes, Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]]; however, during the second and third seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice evolved to become more robust, to allow the expression of a fuller range of emotions. He has appeared in other media relating to ''The Simpsons''&nbsp;– including video games, ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', [[The Simpsons Ride]], commercials and comic books&nbsp;– and inspired an entire line of merchandise. His signature catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]", has been included in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|The New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' since 1998 and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' since 2001.

Homer is one of the most influential characters in the history of television. The [[Great Britain|British]] newspaper ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' described him as "the greatest comic creation of [modern] time". He was named the greatest character "of the last 20 years" in 2010 by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', was ranked the second greatest cartoon character by ''[[TV Guide]]'', behind [[Bugs Bunny]], and was voted the greatest television character of all time by [[Channel 4]] viewers. For voicing Homer, Castellaneta has won four [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance|Outstanding Voice-Over Performance]] and a special-achievement [[Annie Award]]. In 2000, Homer and his family were awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Role in ''The Simpsons''==
Homer is the bumbling husband of Marge and father of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78–79}} He is the son of [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Grampa Simpson|Abraham "Grampa" Simpson]].

''The Simpsons'' uses a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters [[ageless|never physically age]], and, as such, the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. Nevertheless, in several episodes, events in Homer's life have been linked to specific time periods.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78–79}} "[[Mother Simpson]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]], 1995) depicts Homer's mother, Mona, as a radical who went into hiding in 1969 following a run-in with the law;<ref name=MotherSimpson>{{cite episode |title=Mother Simpson |episodelink=Mother Simpson |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Richard Appel|Appel, Rich]]; [[David Silverman (animator)|Silverman, David]] |network=Fox |airdate=1995-11-19 |season=07 |number=08}}</ref> "[[The Way We Was]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]], 1991) shows Homer falling in love with [[Marge Simpson|Marge Bouvier]] as a senior at Springfield High School in 1974;<ref name=WayWeWas>{{cite episode |title=The Way We Was |episodelink=The Way We Was |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Al Jean|Jean, Al]]; [[Mike Reiss|Reiss, Mike]]; [[Sam Simon|Simon, Sam]]; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1991-01-31 |season=02 |number=12}}</ref> and "[[I Married Marge]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]], 1991) implies that Marge became pregnant with Bart in 1980.<ref name=IMarriedMarge>{{cite episode |title=I Married Marge |episodelink=I Married Marge |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Martin, Jeff]]; [[Jeffrey Lynch|Lynch, Jeffrey]] |network=Fox |airdate=1991-12-26 |season=03 |number=12}}</ref> However, the episode "[[That '90s Show]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]], 2008) contradicted much of this backstory, portraying Homer and Marge as a childless couple in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite episode |title=That '90s Show |episodelink=That '90s Show |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Matt Selman|Selman, Matt]]; [[Mark Kirkland|Kirkland, Mark]] |network=Fox |airdate=2008-01-27 |season=19 |number=11}}</ref>

The entire Simpson family was designed so that they would be recognizable in silhouette.<ref>Groening, Matt. (2005). Commentary for "[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Sixth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> The family was crudely drawn because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> Homer's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no characters other than Homer, [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]], and [[Krusty the Clown]] have a similar beard line.<ref>Groening, Matt; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for "[[Principal Charming]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting and redesigned the ear to look normal. However, he still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans.<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Matt Groening]] |title=Simpsons Comics Royale |publisher=HarperCollins |year=2001 |page=90 |isbn=0-00-711854-6}}</ref> The basic shape of Homer's head is described by director [[Mark Kirkland]] as a tube-shaped coffee can with a salad bowl on top.

At one point, his mouth would stretch out back "beyond his beardline"; but this was dropped when it got "out of control."<ref>Silverman, David; Archer, Wes. (2004). Illustrated commentary for "[[Treehouse of Horror IV]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> In some early episodes, Homer's hair was rounded rather than sharply pointed because animation director [[Wes Archer]] felt it should look disheveled. Homer's hair evolved to be consistently pointed.<ref name="Dancin">Groening, Matt; Isaacs, David; Levine, Ken; Reiss, Mike; Kirkland, Mark. (2002). Commentary for "[[Dancin' Homer]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> During the first three seasons, Homer's design for some close-up shots included small lines which were meant to be eyebrows. Matt Groening strongly disliked them and they were eventually dropped.<ref name="Dancin"/>

In the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|season seven]] (1995) episode "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]", Homer was computer animated into a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] character for the first time for the "Homer<sup>3</sup>" segment of the episode. The computer animation directors at [[Pacific Data Images]] worked hard not to "reinvent the character".<ref name=3D/> In the final minute of the segment, the 3D Homer ends up in a real world, live-action [[Los Angeles]]. The scene was directed by [[David Mirkin]] and was the first time a ''Simpsons'' character had been in the real world in the series.<ref name=3D>Oakley, Bill; Weinstein, Josh; Johnson, Tim; Silverman, David; Mirkin, David; Cohen, David X.

He is heavier; one of the hairs on top of his head was removed; and an extra line was placed under the eye. A similar design has been used in subsequent [[flashforward]]s.<ref>Mirkin, David. (2005).

===Voice===

Homer's voice is performed by [[Dan Castellaneta]], who voices numerous other characters, including [[Grampa Simpson]], [[Krusty the Clown]], [[Barney Gumble]], [[Groundskeeper Willie]], [[Mayor Quimby]] and [[Hans Moleman]]. Castellaneta had been part of the regular cast of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' and had previously done some voice-over work in [[Chicago]] alongside his wife [[Deb Lacusta]]. Voices were needed for the [[The Simpsons shorts|Simpsons shorts]], so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta and fellow cast member [[Julie Kavner]] to voice Homer and Marge rather than hire more actors.<ref name="FN"/><ref name="The Age"/> In the shorts and first few seasons of the half-hour show, Homer's voice is different from the majority of the series.

===Character development===
Executive producer [[Al Jean]] notes that in ''The Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> writing room, "everyone loves writing for Homer", and many of his adventures are based on experiences of the writers.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/TV/02/13/simpsons.300/index.html |title=The Simpsons Rakes in the D'oh! |accessdate=2008-09-10 |date=2003-02-13 |author=Tanz, Jason |publisher=CNN}}</ref> In the early seasons of the show, Bart was the main focus. But, around the [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]], Homer became more of the focus. According to Matt Groening, this was because "With Homer, there's just a wider range of jokes you can do. And there are far more drastic consequences to Homer's stupidity. There's only so far you can go with a juvenile delinquent. We wanted Bart to do anything up to the point of him being tried in court as an adult. But Homer is an adult, and his boneheaded-ness is funnier. [...] Homer is launching himself headfirst into every single impulsive thought that occurs to him."<ref name="EW 2010">{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/06/09/simpsons-matt-groening-dan-castellaneta-greatest-character-homer-simpson/ |title='The Simpsons': Matt Groening and Dan Castellaneta on EW's Greatest Character, Homer Simpson |author=Snierson, Dan |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2010-09-07 |work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>

Homer's behavior has changed a number of times through the run of the series.

===Personality===
The comic efficacy of Homer's personality lies in his frequent bouts of bumbling stupidity and laziness, and his explosive anger. He has a low intelligence level and is described by director [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] as "creatively brilliant in his stupidity".<ref name=sundvd/> Homer also shows immense apathy towards work, is overweight, and "is devoted to his stomach".<ref name=sundvd/> His short attention span is evidenced by his impulsive decisions to engage in various hobbies and enterprises, only to "change ... his mind when things go badly".<ref name=sundvd>{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt; [[Mike Scully|Scully, Mike]]; Jean, Al; Brooks, James L.; Silverman, David |date=2007 |title=The Simpsons Movie: A Look Behind the Scenes |medium=DVD |publisher=distributed by ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''}}</ref> Homer often spends his evenings drinking [[Duff Beer]] at [[Moe's Tavern]], and was shown in the episode "[[Duffless]]" ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1993) as a full-blown [[alcoholic]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Duffless |episodelink=Duffless |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[David M. Stern|Stern, David M.]]; [[Jim Reardon|Reardon, Jim]] |network=Fox |airdate=1993-02-18 |season=04 |number=16}}</ref> He is very envious of his neighbors, [[Ned Flanders]] and his family, and is easily enraged by [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]. Homer will often strangle Bart on impulse in a cartoonish manner. The first instance of Homer strangling Bart was in the short "Family Portrait". According to Matt Groening, the rule was that Homer could only strangle Bart impulsively, never with pre-meditation,<ref>Groening, Matt. (2002). Commentary for "[[Simpson and Delilah]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> because doing so "seems sadistic. If we keep it that he's ruled by his impulses, then he can easily switch impulses. So, even though he impulsively wants to strangle Bart, he also gives up fairly easily."<ref name="EW 2010"/> Another of the original ideas entertained by Groening was that Homer would "always get his comeuppance or Bart had to strangle him back", but this was dropped.<ref>Groening, Matt. (2001). Commentary for "[[Bart the Genius]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> Homer shows no compunction about expressing his rage, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family.<ref name=sundvd/>
[[File:HomerStranglesBart.jpg|left|200px|thumb|The first sketch of Homer strangling Bart, drawn in 1988.]]
Homer has complex relationships with all three of his children, and the rest of his family. He often berates Bart, but the two commonly share adventures and are sometimes allies; some episodes, particularly in later seasons, show that the pair have a strange respect for each other's cunning. Homer and Lisa have opposite personalities and he usually overlooks Lisa's talents, but when made aware of his neglect, does everything he can to help her. While Homer's thoughtless antics often upset his family, he has also revealed himself to be a caring father and husband: in "[[Lisa the Beauty Queen]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 4)|season four]], 1992) he sold his cherished ride on the Duff blimp and used the money to enter Lisa in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself;<ref name="Beauty"/> in "[[Rosebud (The Simpsons)|Rosebud]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 5)|season five]], 1993) he gave up his chance at wealth to allow Maggie to keep a cherished teddy bear, despite the show also occasionally implying Homer forgets he has a third child, while the episode "[[And Maggie Makes Three]]" suggests she is the chief reason Homer took and remains at his regular job ([[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]], 1995);<ref>{{cite episode |title=Rosebud |episodelink=Rosebud (The Simpsons) |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder, John]]; [[Wes Archer|Archer, Wes]] |network=Fox |airdate=1993-10-21 |season=05 |number=04}}</ref> in "[[Radio Bart]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 3)|season three]], 1992) he spearheaded an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well;<ref>{{cite episode |title=Radio Bart |episodelink=Radio Bart |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jon Vitti|Vitti, Jon]]; [[Carlos Baeza|Baeza, Carlos]] |network=Fox |airdate=1992-01-09 |season=03 |number=13}}</ref> and in "[[A Milhouse Divided]]", ([[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]], 1996) he arranged a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony.<ref>{{cite episode |title=A Milhouse Divided |episodelink=A Milhouse Divided |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Steve Tompkins|Tompkins, Steve]]; [[Steven Dean Moore|Moore, Steven Dean]] |network=Fox |airdate=1996-12-01 |season=08 |number=06}}</ref> Homer, however, has a poor relationship with his father [[Abraham Simpson|Abraham "Grampa" Simpson]], whom he placed in a [[nursing home]] as soon as he could.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Lisa's First Word |episodelink=Lisa's First Word |series=The Simpsons |credits=Martin, Jeff; Kirkland, Mark |network=Fox |airdate=1992-12-03 |season=04 |number=10}}</ref> The Simpson family will often do their best to avoid unnecessary contact with Grampa, but Homer has shown feelings of love for his father from time to time.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Old Money |episodelink=Old Money (The Simpsons) |series=The Simpsons |credits=[[Jay Kogen|Kogen, Jay]]; [[Wallace Wolodarsky|Wolodarsky, Wallace]]; Silverman, David |network=Fox |airdate=1991-03-28 |season=02 |number=17}}</ref>

===Analysis===
Homer is an "[[everyman]]" and embodies several American stereotypes of working class [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, dim witted, clumsy and a borderline alcoholic.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=78–79}} Matt Groening describes him as "completely ruled by his impulses".<ref>{{cite news |title=Person of the Week: Matt Groening |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=2007-07-27 |url=http://a.abcnews.go.com/WN/PersonOfWeek/story?id=3422830&page=1 |accessdate=2008-09-03}}</ref> Dan Castellaneta calls him "a dog trapped in a man's body", adding, "He's incredibly loyal&nbsp;– not entirely clean&nbsp;– but you gotta love him."<ref name="The Age"/> In his book ''[[Planet Simpson]]'', author [[Chris Turner (author)|Chris Turner]] describes Homer as "the most American of the Simpsons" and believes that while the other Simpson family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is "pure American".{{sfn|Turner|2004|p=80}} In the book ''God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture'', the authors comment that "Homer's progress (or lack thereof) reveals a character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly."<ref>{{cite book |last=Mazur |first=Eric Michael |author2=Kate McCarthy  |title=God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture |year=2001 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-92564-9 |page=243}}</ref> The book ''[[The Simpsons and Philosophy: The D'oh! of Homer]]'' includes a chapter analyzing Homer's character from the perspective of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[virtue ethics]]. Raja Halwani writes that Homer's "love of life" is an admirable character trait, "for many people are tempted to see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and immorality. {{interp|...}} He is not politically correct, he is more than happy to judge others, and he certainly does not seem to be obsessed with his health. These qualities might not make Homer an admirable ''person'', but they do make him admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer Simpsons of this world."<ref>[[#Halwani|Halwani]], pp. 22–23</ref> In 2008, ''Entertainment Weekly'' justified designating ''The Simpsons'' as a television classic by stating, "we all hail Simpson patriarch Homer because his joy is as palpable as his stupidity is stunning".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2007/06/18/new-classics-tv |title=100 New TV Classics |accessdate=2008-09-14 |author1=Armstrong, Jennifer |author2=Pastorek, Whitney |author3=Snierson, Dan |author4=Stack, Tim |author5=Wheat, Alynda |year=2008 |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>

In the [[The Simpsons (season 8)|season eight]] episode "[[Homer's Enemy]]" the writers decided to examine "what it would be like to actually work alongside Homer Simpson".<ref>{{cite news |author=Snierson, Dan |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275114,00.html |title=Springfield of Dreams |accessdate=2008-09-21 |date=2000-01-14 |publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref> The episode explores the possibilities of a realistic character with a strong [[work ethic]] named Frank Grimes placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99–106}}<ref>Weinstein, Josh. (2006). Commentary for "[[Homer's Enemy]]", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Eighth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.</ref> By the end of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering "real American hero", has become the villain; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=99–106}}

In ''Gilligan Unbound'', author [[Paul Cantor|Paul Arthur Cantor]] states that he believes Homer's devotion to his family has added to the popularity of the character. He writes, "Homer is the distillation of pure fatherhood. {{interp|...}} This is why, for all his stupidity, bigotry and self-centered quality, we cannot hate Homer. He continually fails at being a good father, but he never gives up trying, and in some basic and important sense that makes him a good father."<ref>{{cite book |last=Cantor |first=Paul Arthur |title=Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization |year=2001 |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |isbn=0-7425-0779-3 |pages=74–76}}</ref> ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' remarked "Homer is good because, above all, he is capable of great love.

===D'oh!===
{{Main|D'oh!}}
Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt "D'oh!", is typically uttered when he injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show|Tracey Ullman Show]]'' short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by [[James Finlayson (actor)|Jimmy Finlayson]], the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 [[Laurel and Hardy]] films. Finlayson had used the term as a [[minced oath]] to stand in for the word "[[Damnation|Damn]]!" [[Matt Groening]] felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered "D'oh!"<ref name=herald>{{Cite news |title=What's the story with ...
