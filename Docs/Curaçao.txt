Before the [[dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles]] on 10 October 2010, Curaçao was administered as the "Island Territory of Curaçao"<ref>English name used by the Government of Curaçao and the Government of the Netherlands Antilles (English was an official language of the Netherlands Antilles and the Island Territory of Curaçao)</ref> (Dutch: ''Eilandgebied Curaçao'', Papiamentu: ''Teritorio Insular di Kòrsou''), one of five [[List of islands of the Netherlands Antilles|island territories]] of the former Netherlands Antilles.

==Etymology==
[[File:1562 Americae-Gutierrez map 10hrs-inn Sth-Florida-Cuba-Spagnola-Benezuela-to-Lesser-Antilles.jpg|thumb|left|Map from 1562 with Curaçao indicated as Qúracao.]]
According to Edgard Otero,{{Better source|reason=Who is this person? The only reference to him I can find online is this page and pages that mirror it. Also, is "Origins of countries' names" a book? I can't find it (or any other reference to Otero) on Amazon.|date=April 2016}} author of "Origins of countries' names", the island was discovered by Spaniards, who left in the island members of their crew who had become ill during the trip. When the ships returned to the island one year later, expecting to find the sick already dead, they found their old crew members healthy and healed. For that reason, the island was baptized as "Isla de la Curación" (Island of the Cure, or Island of Healing). In 1520 the island would figure for the first time in a map - which was nonetheless designed by the Portuguese, in whose language the island was called "Ilha da Curação" (Curação still means healing in Portuguese).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Another theory for the origin of the name of the island Curaçao is that it is derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for ''heart'' (''coração''), referring to the island as a centre in trade. [[Spain|Spanish]] traders kept the name as ''Curazao'', which was followed by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

A third possible explanation is that Curaçao derives from a similar-sounding name that the [[Arawak people]]  had used to identify themselves.<ref>Joubert and Van Buurt, 1994</ref>

On a map created by [[Hieronymus Cock]] in 1562 in [[Antwerp]], the island was referred to as Qúracao.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/map_item.pl?data=/home/www/data/gmd/gmd3/g3290/g3290/ct000342.jp2&style=dsxpmap&itemLink=r?ammem/gmd:@filreq(@field(NUMBER+@band(g3290+ct000342))+@field(COLLID+dsxpmap))&title=Americae%20sive%20qvartae%20orbis%20partis%20nova%20et%20exactissima%20descriptio%20%2f%20avtore%20Diego%20Gvtiero%20Philippi%20Regis%20Hisp.%20etc.%20Cosmographo%20;%20Hiero.%20Cock%20excvde%201562%20;%20Hieronymus%20Cock%20excude%20cum%20gratia%20et%20priuilegio%201562. Cock's 1562 map] at the Library of Congress website</ref>

Four British [[Royal Navy]] ships have been named after the Island between 1809 and 1942. All have used the unusual spelling, [[HMS Curacoa]]. The last of these was a [[HMS Curacoa (D41)|C-class light cruiser of 1917]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The name "Curaçao" has become associated with a shade of blue, because of the deep-blue version of the [[liqueur]] named [[Curaçao liqueur|Curaçao]] (also known as "blue Curaçao").{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==History==
{{main|History of Curaçao}}
[[File:Curaçao1836.png|thumb|Map of Curaçao in 1836]]
The original inhabitants of Curaçao were [[Arawak peoples]]. Their ancestors had migrated to the island from the mainland of South America, likely hundreds of years before Europeans arrived.

The first Europeans recorded as seeing the island were members of a Spanish expedition under the leadership of [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in 1499. The Spaniards enslaved most of the Arawak as their labour force. They sometimes forcibly relocated the survivors to other colonies where workers were needed. In 1634, after the Netherlands achieved independence from Spain, Dutch colonists started to occupy the island. European powers were trying to get bases in the Caribbean.

The [[Dutch West India Company]] founded the capital of [[Willemstad]] on the banks of an inlet called the 'Schottegat'. Curaçao had been ignored by colonists, because it lacked gold deposits. The [[natural harbour]] of Willemstad proved to be an ideal spot for trade. Commerce and shipping&nbsp;— and [[piracy in the Caribbean|piracy]]—became Curaçao's most important economic activities. In addition, in 1662 the Dutch West India Company made Curaçao a centre for the [[Atlantic slave trade]], often bringing slaves here for sale elsewhere in the Caribbean.

[[Sephardic Jews]] settled here with the Dutch and in then-[[Dutch Brazil]]; they have had a significant influence on the culture and economy of the island.<ref name="history">"[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Curacao.html Curaçao]". Jewish Virtual Library.</ref> Some merchants were part of the Dutch colonial slave trade.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' |date=February 13, 1994 |title=Jews and the Slave Trade |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-02-13/news/1994044079_1_atlantic-slave-slave-trade-jews/3 }}</ref>

In the [[Franco-Dutch War]], Count<!--"Admiral" might be more appropriate here--> [[Jean II d'Estrées]] planned to attack Curaçao. His fleet&nbsp;— 12 men of war, three fireships, two transports, a hospital ship, and 12 privateers&nbsp;— met with disaster, losing seven men of war and two other ships when they struck reefs off the [[Las Aves archipelago]]. They had made a serious navigational error, hitting the reefs on 11 May 1678, a week after setting sail from [[Saint Kitts]]. Curaçao marked the events by a day of thanksgiving, celebrated for decades into the 18th century, to commemorate the island's escape from being invaded by the French.

Although a few [[plantations]] were established on the island by the Dutch, the first profitable industry established on Curaçao was [[salt mines|salt mining]]. The mineral was a lucrative export at the time and was a major factor for the island being part of international commerce.

[[File:Willemstad harbor.jpg|thumb|Dutch architecture along [[Willemstad]]'s harbour]]
Many Dutch colonists grew affluent from the slave trade, and the city built impressive colonial buildings. Curaçao architecture blends Dutch and Spanish colonial styles. The wide range of historic buildings in and around Willemstad has resulted in the capital being designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Landhouses (former plantation estates) and West African style ''kas di pal'i maishi'' (former slave dwellings) are scattered all over the island. Some have been restored and can be visited.

In 1795, a major [[Curaçao Slave Revolt of 1795|slave revolt]] took place under the leaders [[Tula (Curaçao)|Tula Rigaud]], Louis Mercier, Bastian Karpata, and Pedro Wakao. Up to 4000 slaves on the northwest section of the island revolted. Over a thousand of the slaves were involved in heavy gunfights. After a month, the slave owners suppressed the revolt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.papiamentu.net/curacao/heroes.html |title=Curaçao History |publisher=Papiamentu.net |accessdate=2010-10-10}}</ref>

Curaçao's proximity to [[South America]] resulted in interaction with cultures of the coastal areas. For instance, architectural similarities can be seen between the 19th-century parts of [[Willemstad]] and the nearby Venezuelan city of [[Santa Ana de Coro|Coro]] in [[Falcón State]]. The latter has also been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the 19th century, Curaçaoans such as [[Manuel Piar]] and [[Luis Brión]] were prominently engaged in the wars of independence of Venezuela and [[Colombia]]. Political refugees from the mainland (such as [[Simon Bolivar]]) regrouped in Curaçao. Children from affluent Venezuelan families were educated on the island.

[[File:Luis Brión 2012 000.jpg|thumb|[[Luis Brión]], a Curaçao-born [[Venezuela]]n admiral]]
During the 18th and 19th centuries, the island changed hands among the British, the French, and the Dutch several times. In the early 19th century, Portuguese and Lebanese migrated to Curaçao attracted by the business opportunities. Stable Dutch rule returned in 1815, at the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]], when the island was incorporated into the colony of [[Curaçao and Dependencies]].

The Dutch abolished slavery in 1863, bringing a change in the economy with the shift to wage labour. Some inhabitants of Curaçao emigrated to other islands, such as [[Cuba]], to work in [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar cane plantations]]. Other former slaves had nowhere to go and remained working for the plantation owner in the [[tenant farmer]] system.<ref>Called "Paga Tera"</ref> This was an instituted order in which the former slave leased land from his former master. In exchange the tenant promised to give up most of his harvest to the former slave master. This system lasted until the beginning of the 20th century.

Historically, Dutch was not widely spoken on the island outside of colonial administration; its use increased in the late 19th and early 20th century.<ref name=Putte>''Dede pikiña ku su bisiña: Papiamentu-Nederlands en de onverwerkt verleden tijd''. van Putte, Florimon., 1999. Zutphen: de Walburg Pers</ref> Students on Curaçao, Aruba, and Bonaire were taught predominantly in Spanish up until the late 19th century. There were also efforts to introduce bilingual popular education in Dutch and Papiamentu in the late 19th century (van Putte 1999).

When in 1914, oil was discovered in the [[Maracaibo Basin]] town of [[Mene Grande]], the fortunes of the island were dramatically altered.

In 1915, the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] (Shell) and the Dutch government decided to establish  an extensive oil refinery installation on the former site of the slave-trade market at Asiento. The oil company suddenly had many jobs for the local population and attracted a wave of immigration from surrounding nations.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}The installation became operational three years later. There were a number of geographic and political advantages to establishing a refinery on an island off the Venezuelan coast: the predicted market growth in the US, the politically troubled Mexican oil production and the expected increase of traffic through the [[Panama Canal]]. A natural deepwater harbour and a stable political climate made Curaçao the obvious choice. Shell has been the largest employer on the island since 1918. Of the 44,344 inhabitants in 1929, 10,924 worked for the oil industry. This number peaked in 1952, with 12,631 employees.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The refinery was an important source of fuel for allied forces in the World War II. Economically, the refinery has been the mainstay of Curaçao since 1915: it generates currency necessary for vital imports and is thus crucial to the future economic development of the island. The refinery’s success is also its weak point. If this sector is threatened, the consequences for Curaçao would be immediate and significant.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the years before and after [[World War II]], [[Ashkenazi Jews]] emigrated from Eastern Europe, many of whom were [[Romanian Jews]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the early years, both Shell and [[Exxon]] held drilling concessions in Venezuela, which ensured a constant supply of crude oil to the refineries in Aruba and Curaçao. Crude oil production in Venezuela was inexpensive. The integrated companies Shell and Exxon controlled the entire industry from pumping, transporting and refining to marketing the end product. The refineries on Aruba and Curaçao operated in global markets and were profitable partly because of the margin between the production costs of crude oil and the revenues realized on products. This provided a safety net for losses incurred through inefficiency or excessive operating costs at the refineries. The nationalization of the oil industry in Venezuela in 1975 was a setback.
The companies had to buy oil on the international markets at higher prices. As the Shell refinery on Curaçao was best equipped to process the Venezuelan heavy crude, the company was subject to Venezuelan oil politics when it came to price and supply. Coupled with high operating costs, these difficulties were the reasons the refinery on Curaçao continually operated at a loss.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Curaçao experienced an economic downturn in the early 1980s. Shell's refinery on Curaçao operated with significant losses from 1975 to 1979, and again from 1982 to 1985. Persistent losses, global over-production, tougher competition and low market expectations threatened the future of the Shell refinery in Curaçao. In 1985, after a presence of 70 years, Royal Dutch Shell decided to end its activities on Curaçao. Shell's announcement came at a crucial moment; the fragile economy of Curaçao had been stagnating for some time. Several revenue generating endeavours suffered even more during this period: tourism from Venezuela collapsed after the devaluation of the bolivar, the transport industry deteriorated with deleterious effects on the profits of the Antillean Airline Company and the Curaçao Dry Dock Company experienced major setbacks. The offshore industry (financial services) also experienced a downturn because of radical new tax laws in the US. Significant intervention in the public sector was required to reduce budget deficits. The future did not look promising: a macro-economic study predicted economic stagnation for several years even if Shell stayed and other industries experienced growth. It was more likely that the gross domestic product (GDP) would shrink by 20 percent, unemployment would rise to 35 percent and emigration would increase. It was clear that closure had to be avoided because the consequences could be disastrous.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Curaçao was an ideal site for the refinery, as it was away from the social and civil unrest of the South American mainland, but near enough to the Maracaibo Basin oil fields. It had an excellent natural harbour that could accommodate large oil tankers.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

East and South Asian immigrants arrived during the economic boom of the early 20th century. Shell brought affluence to the island. Large scale housing was provided and Willemstad developed an extensive infrastructure. However, inequality among the social groups of Curaçao led to discontent and the antagonisms between Curaçao social groups and culminated in [[1969 Curaçao uprising|rioting and protest on 30 May 1969]]. The civil unrest launched a [[social movement]] that resulted in the local Afro-Caribbean population attaining more influence over the political process (Anderson and Dynes 1975).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

in the early 20th century, Dutch was made the sole language of instruction in the educational system to facilitate schooling for the children of [[expatriate]] employees of Royal Dutch Shell (Romer, 1999). [[Papiamentu]], the local [[Creole language]], was tentatively reintroduced in the school curriculum during the mid-1980s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Curaçao gained self-government on 1 January 1954, as an island territory of the Netherlands Antilles. The islanders did not fully participate in the political process until after the social movements of the late 1960s.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The island has developed a tourist industry and offered low corporate taxes to encourage companies to set up holdings in order to avoid higher taxes elsewhere. It has emphasized its diverse heritage to expand its tourism industry.  Since the late 20th century, immigrants have come from neighbouring countries, such as Venezuela, but also from the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Haiti]], and the [[Anglophone Caribbean]] and Colombia. In the early 21st century, a number of Dutch [[pension]]ers (''pensionados'') have settled on the island for its mild climate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In the mid-1980s, Shell sold the refinery for the symbolic amount of one [[Netherlands Antillean guilder|Antillean guilder]] to a local government consortium. The aging refinery has been the subject of lawsuits in recent years, which charge that its emissions, including [[sulfur dioxide]] and [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]], far exceed safety standards.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=Reuters|date=2008-06-30 |title=Curaçao refinery sputters on, despite emissions |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKN2929170620080701|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> The government consortium currently leases the refinery to the Venezuelan state oil company [[PDVSA]].

On 2 July 1984, the 30th anniversary of the first elected Island Council, the council inaugurated the national flag and the official anthem. In the 2000s, the political relationship with the other islands of the Netherlands Antilles, and with the Netherlands, came under discussion again. In a referendum held on 8 April 2005, the residents voted for separate status outside the Netherlands Antilles, similar to [[Aruba]]. They rejected the options for full independence, becoming part of the Netherlands, or retaining the status quo.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Due to an economic slump in the late 1990s and early 2000s, emigration to the Netherlands has been high.<ref>http://www.wodc.nl/images/ob299-summary_tcm44-402600.pdf</ref>

On 1 July 2007, the island of Curaçao was due to become a country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. On 28 November 2006, this was delayed when the island council rejected a clarification memorandum on the process. A new island council ratified this agreement on 9 July 2007.<ref name="approved">{{cite web |author=The Daily Herald St. Maarten |title=Curaçao IC ratifies 2 November accord |url=http://www.thedailyherald.com/news/daily/k045/ratify045.html |date=2007-07-09 |accessdate=2007-07-13 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711181904/http://www.thedailyherald.com/news/daily/k045/ratify045.html |archivedate=11 July 2007}}</ref> On 15 December 2008, Curaçao was scheduled to become a separate country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands (as Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles were).

Political debate has centered on the issue of Papiamentu becoming the sole language of instruction. Proponents argue that it will help preserve the language and will improve the quality of primary and secondary school education. Proponents of Dutch-language instruction argue that students who study in Dutch will be better prepared for the university education offered to Curaçao residents in the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

When the Dutch arrived in 1634, they built forts at key points around the island to protect themselves from foreign powers, privateers, and pirates. Six of the best preserved forts can still be seen today:

* [[Piscadera Bay Fort]] (built between 1701–1704)

In 1957, the Hotel Van der Valk Plaza Curaçao was built on top of the Waterfort.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8tD8_FRoW8C&lpg=PA70&ots=etQ7sz51r6&dq=waterfort%20vander%20valk%20hotel%20constructie&pg=PA70#v=onepage&q=waterfort%20vander%20valk%20hotel%20constructie&f=false |title=On top of the Waterfort |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref>

The Riffort contains restaurants, and shops. It is located on the opposite side of the Waterfort across the entrance to the harbour. In 2009, the Renaissance Curaçao Resort and Casino opened next to the Riffort.<ref>(2011) GEA Curaçao. Ref.

==Geography==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
[[File:Curacao-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|Map of Curaçao]]
[[File:Curaçao - Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indië-Antilles part 2, left.gif|thumb|A detailed map of Curaçao from the ''Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indië 1914-1917''.]]

Curaçao, as well as the rest of the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] and also [[Trinidad and Tobago]], lies on the continental shelf of South America, and is thus geologically considered to lie entirely in South America.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Curaçao's highest point is the Sint Christoffelberg {{convert|375|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} The coastlines bays, inlets and hot springs offer an on-site source of natural mineral, thermal or seawater used in hydrotherapy and mesotherapy, making this island one of many balneoclimateric areas in the region.

===Flora===
The flora of Curaçao differs from the typical tropical island vegetation. [[Xeric]] [[scrubland]]s are common, with various forms of [[cacti]], thorny shrubs, [[evergreen]], and the [[watapana]] tree, called [[divi-divi]] on Aruba, characteristic for the ABC islands and the national symbol of Aruba.

===Fauna===
{{further|Rodents of the Caribbean#Curaçao}}

===Climate===
Curaçao has a [[tropical savannah climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''As'') with a [[dry season]] from January to September and a [[wet season]] from October to December.<ref name="meteoan">{{cite web|url = http://www.meteo.an/Climate_Sum.asp | title = Climate Summaries | publisher = Meteorological Department Curaçao | accessdate = February 21, 2013}}</ref> The temperatures are relatively constant with small differences throughout the year. The [[trade winds]] bring cooling during the day and the same trade winds bring warming during the night. The coolest month is January with an average temperature of {{convert|26.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} and the warmest month is September with an average temperature of {{convert|28.9|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The year's average maximum temperature is {{convert|31.2|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The year's average minimum temperature is {{convert|25.3|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

Curaçao lies outside the [[hurricane belt]], but is still occasionally affected by hurricanes, as for example [[Hurricane Hazel|Hazel]] in 1954, [[Hurricane Anna (1961)|Anna]] in 1961 [[Hurricane Felix (2007)|Felix]] in 2007 and [[Hurricane Omar (2008)|Omar]] in 2008. A [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] of a [[hurricane]] in Curaçao has not occurred since the [[United States]] [[National Hurricane Center]] started tracking hurricanes. Curaçao has, however, been directly affected by pre-hurricane tropical storms several times; the latest which did so were [[Hurricane Tomas|Tomas]] in 2010, [[Hurricane Cesar-Douglas|Cesar]] in 1996, [[Hurricane Joan-Miriam|Joan-Miriam]] in 1988, [[Hurricane Cora|Cora]] and [[Hurricane Greta-Olivia|Greta]] in 1978, [[Hurricane Edith (1971)|Edith]] and [[Hurricane Irene (1971)|Irene]] in 1971 and [[Hurricane Francelia|Francelia]] in 1969. Tomas brushed Curaçao as a tropical storm, dropping as much as {{convert|265|mm|1|abbr=on}} of precipitation on the territory, nearly half of the annual precipitation in one day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Doden door noodweer op Curaçao|url=http://www.nu.nl/buitenland/2369389/doden-noodweer-curaao.html|accessdate=1 November 2010|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Netherlands National News Agency|language=nl}}</ref> This made Tomas one of the wettest events in the island's history,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myheadlines.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=MyHeadlines&file=index5&sid=1558&cid=3586951&source=Nieuws.nl|title=Damdoorbraken in Curaçao door storm Tomas|accessdate=2 November 2010|date=2 November 2010|publisher=Nieuws.nl|author=Staff Writer|language=nl}}</ref> as well as one of the most devastating; its flooding killed two people and caused over NAƒ60&nbsp;million (US$28&nbsp;million) in damage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curalive.com/news/versgeperst/06nov2010-50-miljoen-schade|title=50 miljoen schade|date=6 November 2010|publisher=versgeperst.com|author=Elisa Koek|language=nl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnw.nl/caribiana/article/twee-doden-op-curacao-door-tropische-storm-tomas|title=Twee doden op Curaçao door Tropische Storm Tomas|author=Redactie Aworaki|date=2 November 2010|publisher=Aworaki.nl}}</ref>

===Geology===
The northern sea floor drops steeply within {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}} of the shore. This drop-off is known as the "blue edge".

On Curaçao, four major geological formations can be found: The lava formation, the Knip formation, the Mid-Curaçao formation and Limestone formations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchstationcarmabi.org/ecosystems/geology|title=CARMABI Research Station Curacao|work=researchstationcarmabi.org}}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:EU OCT and OMR map en.png|thumb|right|Map of the European Union in the world with overseas countries and territories and outermost regions]]
{{main|Government of Curaçao}}

The government of Curaçao takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[country]]. The [[Prime Minister of Curaçao|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and parliament.

The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

Convicted felons are held at the [[Sentro di Detenshon i Korekshon Kòrsou|Curaçao Centre for Detention and Correction]] prison.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Curaçao has full autonomy on most matters, with the exceptions summed up in the [[Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands]] under the title "[[Kingdom of the Netherlands#Kingdom affairs|Kingdom affairs]]".{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Military==
Two [[Royal Netherlands Navy|Dutch]] naval bases, [[Parera]] and [[Suffisant]], are located on the island of Curaçao.
Officers of the [[Military of Aruba|Arubaanse Militie]] complete further training on Curaçao.

===Conscription===
Suffisant Naval Base has facilities for conscription in the Caribbean, which has not been military conscription since 1997, but social conscription. This type of conscription offers underprivileged Antillean young people the chance of taking professional training.<ref>[https://www.defensie.nl/english/organisation/navy/contents/navy-units/dutch-naval-command-caribbean] Commander Netherlands Forces in the Caribbean</ref>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Curaçao}}

Curaçao has an [[open economy]], with tourism, international trade, shipping services, refining, storage (oil and bunkering) and international financial services being the most important sectors. Curaçao's economy is well developed and supports a high standard of living, ranking 46th in the world in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (PPP) per capita]] and 27th in the world in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|nominal GDP per capita]]. Curaçao possesses a [[World Bank high-income economy|high income economy]], as defined by the World Bank. Activities related to the port of Willemstad (like the [[Free Trade Zone]]) make a significant contribution to the economy. To achieve the government's aim to make its economy more diverse, efforts are being made to attract more foreign investment. This policy, called the 'Open Arms' policy, features a heavy focus on information technology companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curacao-law.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/Investors%20Guide%20Curacao%202006.pdf |title=1609_1_DEZ_Manual_binnenw.qxd |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mindmagnet.com |url=http://www.ecommerceatcuracao.com/corporate.htm |title=Ecommerce at Curaçao Corporate |publisher=Ecommerceatcuracao.com |date=2001-03-01 |accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investcuracao.com/01e01.html |title=Economic Data Overview |publisher=Investcuracao.com |accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref><!---need very good cites for comparing country to "other" (unnamed) neighbors.

===Tourism===
[[File:View elevator Fort.JPG|thumb|right|View of Piscadera Fort and Bay]]
While tourism plays a major role in Curaçao's economy, it is less reliant on tourism than other Caribbean countries. Most tourists originate from the Eastern United States, South America and the Netherlands. It currently leads the Caribbean in cruise tourism growth with 610,186 cruise passengers in 2013, a 41.4% increase over the prior year.<ref name="CaribbeanInTourismGrowth">{{cite news|author=Caribbean Journal staff |url=http://www.caribjournal.com/2014/02/14/curacao-leading-caribbean-in-cruise-tourism-growth/|title=Curaçao Leading Caribbean in Cruise Tourism Growth |publisher=Caribjournal.com |date=2014-02-14 |accessdate=2014-02-14}}</ref> [[Hato International Airport]] received 1,772,501 passengers in 2013 and recently announced capital investments totaling US$48 million aimed at transforming the airport into a regional hub by 2018.

The island's [[Continental shelf|insular shelf]] has a sharp drop-off known as the "Blue Edge."{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Scuba diving]] tourists often visit for this vista.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Coral reefs for [[snorkeling]] and scuba diving can be reached without a boat. The southern coast has calm waters as well as many small beaches, such as Jan Thiel and Cas Abou. The coastline of Curaçao features numerous bays and inlets which serve as popular mooring locations for boats.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Some of the coral reefs are affected by tourism. [[Playa Porto Marie|Porto Marie Beach]] is experimenting with artificial coral reefs in order to improve the reef's condition.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Hundreds of artificial coral blocks that have been placed are now home to a large array of tropical fish.

[[File:Curacao-Sea-Aquarium-2013.JPG|thumb|The Curaçao Sea Aquarium and the Dolphin Academy share this islet on the west coast of Curaçao, with [[Seaquarium Beach]] nearby.]]

===Labour===
In 2013, the unemployment rate was 13%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curacaochronicle.com/local/unemployment-rose-to-13-0-percent|title=Unemployment rose to 13.0 percent|work=Curaçao Chronicle}}</ref>

===Financial services===
Curaçao's history in [[financial services]] dates back to [[World War I]]. Prior to this period, the financial arms of local merchant houses functioned as informal lenders to the community. However, at the turn of the century, Curaçao underwent industrialization, and a number of merchant houses established private [[commercial bank]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://books.caribseek.com/Curacao/Commercial_History_of_Curacao/twentieth-century-private-banking.shtml |title=Twentieth Century Private Banking&nbsp;— Roots Of Our Future |publisher=caribseek.com |date=2002-12-11 |accessdate=2014-02-14}}</ref> As the economy grew, these banks began assuming additional functions eventually becoming full-fledged financial institutions.

The [[Dutch Caribbean Securities Exchange]] is located in the capital of Willemstad, as is the [[Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten]]; the latter of which dates to 1828. It is the oldest [[central bank]] in the Western Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.centralbank.an/index.php?eid=1948 |title=In 175 years the Bank has evolved from a near dormant institution in the nineteenth century to a vibrant organization able to adapt to the ever changing financial world in the twenty-first century |publisher=centralbank.an |date=2003-02-01 |accessdate=2013-12-06}}</ref> The island's legal system supports a variety of corporate structures and is a [[corporate haven]]. Though Curaçao is considered a [[tax haven]], it adheres to the EU Code of Conduct against harmful tax practices. It holds a qualified intermediary status from the [[United States Internal Revenue Service]]. It is an accepted jurisdiction of the [[OECD]] and Caribbean [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]]. The country enforces Anti-[[Money Laundering]] and [[Counter-Terrorism]] funding compliance.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Trade===
Curaçao trades mainly with the United States, Venezuela, and the European Union. It has an Association Agreement with the European Union which allows companies which do business in and via Curaçao to export products to European markets,<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070624215811/http://www.curacao-chamber.an/c-info-htm/content/EUTradeProgram.htm EU Trade Program<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=May 2009}}</ref> free of import duties and quotas. It is also a participant in the US [[Caribbean Basin Initiative]] allowing it to have preferential access to the US market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustr.gov/Trade_Development/Preference_Programs/CBI/Section_Index.html |title=USTR&nbsp;– Caribbean Basin Initiative |publisher=Ustr.gov |date=2000-10-01 |accessdate=2009-05-23}}</ref>

===Prostitution===
[[Prostitution]] in Curaçao is legal only for foreign women who get a temporary permit to work in the large open-air brothel called "[[Le Mirage (brothel)|Le Mirage]]" or "Campo Alegre" that has operated near the airport since the 1940s, and for the men (locals included) who make use of their services. Curaçao monitors, contains and regulates the industry. The government states that the workers in these establishments are thereby given a safe environment and access to medical practitioners. This approach does exclude local women (or men) to legally make a living from prostitution and does lead to loss of local income as the foreign prostitutes sent or take most of their earnings home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://global-writes.com/2009/08/curacaos-x-rated-resort.html|title=Curaçao's X-Rated Resort|year=2009|publisher=Global Writes|accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>

The [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] has cited anecdotal evidence claiming that,"Curaçao...[is a] destination island... for women trafficked for the sex trade from Peru, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, according to local observers. At least 500 foreign women reportedly are in prostitution throughout the five islands of the Antilles, some of whom have been trafficked."<ref name="trafficking192">{{cite web |url=http://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/105388.htm |title=Trafficking in Persons Report |accessdate=|date=4 June 2008 |work=|publisher=U.S. State Dept. |page=192 |archiveurl=|archivedate=|quote=}}</ref> The US Department of State has said that the government of Curaçao frequently underestimates the extent of [[human trafficking]] problems.<ref name="trafficking192"/>

===Languages===
Curaçao is a [[Multilingualism|polyglot]] society. The official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Papiamentu]], and [[English language|English]].<ref name="official-languages"/> However, Dutch is the sole language for all administration and legal matters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcaribbeanlegalportal.com/about-us/the-dutch-caribbean |title=About Us |website=DutchCaribbeanLegalPortal.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref> Most of Curaçao's population is able to converse in at least two of the languages of Papiamentu, Dutch, English, and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

The most widely spoken language is Papiamentu, a [[Portuguese-based creole languages|Portuguese creole]] spoken in all levels of society. Papiamentu was introduced as a language of [[primary school]] education in 1993, making Curaçao one of a handful of places where a creole language is used as a medium to acquire basic literacy.<ref name="Liddicoat2007">{{cite book|author=Anthony Liddicoat|title=Language planning and policy: issues in language planning and literacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aP3iylRYWywC&pg=PA149|accessdate=9 August 2011|date=15 June 2007|publisher=Multilingual Matters|isbn=978-1-85359-977-4|page=149}}</ref>
Spanish and English also have a long historical presence in Curaçao. Spanish became an important language in the 18th century due to the close economic ties with Spanish colonies in what are now Venezuela and Colombia.<ref name=Putte/> Use of English dates to the early 19th century, when the British took Curaçao and [[Bonaire]]. When Dutch rule resumed in 1815, officials already noted wide use of the language.<ref name=Putte/>

According to the 2001 census, Papiamentu is the [[first language]] of 81.2% of the population. Dutch is the first language of 8% of the population. Spanish is the first language of 4% of the population, and English is the first language of 2.9%.<ref name="cbs">{{cite web | url = http://www.cbs.cw/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=103:households-by-the-most-spoken-language-in-the-household&catid=48:household-characteristics&Itemid=82 | title = Households by the most spoken language in the household Population and Housing Census 2001 | publisher = Central Bureau of Statistics}}</ref> However, these numbers divide the population in terms of first language and do not account for the high rate of [[bilingualism]] in the population of Curaçao.

===Ethnicities===
<!---this needs to be "what is", not what was or why it is-->
[[File:bulawaya-1.jpg|thumb|A Bulawaya dance]]
Because of its history, the island's population comes from a number of ethnic backgrounds. There is an [[Afro-Caribbean]] majority of African descent, and also sizeable minorities of [[Dutch people|Dutch]], Latin American, [[French people|French]], [[South Asia]]n, [[East Asia]]n, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[Levant]]ine people. Additionally, there are both [[Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi]] Jews.

===Religion===
{{Pie chart

According to a 2011 estimate, the majority of the inhabitants of Curaçao: Roman Catholic 72.8%, Pentecostal 6.6%, Protestant 3.2%, Adventist 3%, Jehovah's Witness 2%, Evangelical 1.9%, other 3.8%, none 6%, unspecified 0.6%.<ref name=CIAWF />

This includes a shift towards the charismatic renewal or charismatic movement since the mid-1970s. Other denominations include the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and the [[Methodist Church]]. Alongside these Christian denominations, some inhabitants practice [[Montamentu]] and other diaspora African religions.{{citation needed|date= September 2015}} Like elsewhere in Latin America, Pentecostalism is on the rise. There are also practising Muslims and Hindus.

While small, Curaçao's [[Judaism|Jewish]] community has had a significant impact on the island's history.<ref name="history"/> Curaçao has the oldest active Jewish congregation in the [[Americas]], dating to 1651. The [[Curaçao synagogue]] is the oldest [[synagogue]] of the Americas in continuous use, since its completion in 1732 on the site of a previous synagogue.

==Education==

Public education is based on the Dutch educational system and besides the public schools, private and parochial schools are also available. Since the introduction of a new public education law in 1992, compulsory primary education starts at age six and continues six years, secondary lasts for another five.<ref name="edu">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kw5W8m87FpkC&lpg=PA593&dq=Cura%C3%A7ao%20education&pg=PA593#v=onepage&q=had%20671%20students%20in%201996&f=false |title=South America, Central America and the Caribbean 2003&nbsp;– Page 593 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2011-12-17}}</ref>

The main institute of higher learning is the [[University of Curaçao]], enrolling 2,100 students.<ref name="edu"/> The comprehensive model of education is under influences from both Dutch and American's education offering. Other higher education offering on the island include [[Offshore Medical School in the Caribbean|offshore medical schools]], language schools and academies for fine art, music, police, teacher and nurse-training.<ref>{{cite book |last= Rosalind Latiner |first=Raby |title=Community College Models: Globalization and Higher Education Reform |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vzyx5mwzGGcC&lpg=PA260&pg=PA260#v=onepag|accessdate=7 May 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=Springer |location= |isbn= 978-1-4020-9477-4|page=260}}</ref>

==Culture==

===Literature===
Despite the island's relatively small population, the diversity of languages and cultural influences on Curaçao have generated a remarkable literary tradition, primarily in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Papiamentu]]. The oral traditions of the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] [[indigenous peoples]] are lost. West African slaves brought the tales of [[Anansi]], thus forming the basis of Papiamentu literature. The first published work in Papiamentu was a poem by [[Joseph Sickman Corsen]] entitled ''Atardi'', published in the ''La Cruz'' newspaper in 1905. Throughout Curaçaoan literature, [[narrative]] techniques and metaphors best characterized as [[magic realism]] tend to predominate.  Novelists and poets from Curaçao have made an impressive contribution to [[Caribbean Literature|Caribbean]] and [[Dutch literature]].  Best known are [[Cola Debrot]], [[Frank Martinus Arion]], Pierre Lauffer, Elis Juliana,Guillermo Rosario, Boeli van Leeuwen and [[Tip Marugg]].

===Cuisine===
Local food is called ''Krioyo'' (pronounced the same as ''criollo'', the Spanish word for "Creole") and boasts a blend of flavours and techniques best compared to Caribbean cuisine and Latin American cuisine. Dishes common in Curaçao are found in [[Aruba]] and [[Bonaire]] as well. Popular dishes include: stobá (a stew made with various ingredients such as [[papaya]], [[beef]] or [[goat]]), Guiambo (soup made from [[okra]] and [[seafood]]), kadushi (cactus soup), sopi mondongo (intestine soup), funchi (cornmeal paste similar to [[fufu]], [[ugali]] and [[polenta]]) and a lot of fish and other seafood. The ubiquitous side dish is fried [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]. Local bread rolls are made according to a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] recipe. All around the island, there are snèk's which serve local dishes as well as alcoholic drinks in a manner akin to the English [[public house]].

The ubiquitous breakfast dish is pastechi: fried pastry with fillings of cheese, tuna, ham, or ground meat. Around the holiday season special dishes are consumed, such as the [[hallaca]] and pekelé, made out of [[salt cod]]. At weddings and other special occasions a variety of kos dushi are served: kokada (coconut sweets), ko'i lechi (condensed milk and sugar sweet) and tentalaria (peanut sweets). The [[Curaçao liqueur]] was developed here, when a local experimented with the rinds of the local [[citrus]] fruit known as [[laraha]]. [[Suriname]]se, Chinese, [[Indonesia]]n, Indian and Dutch culinary influences also abound. The island also has a number of Chinese restaurants that serve mainly Indonesian dishes such as [[satay]], [[nasi goreng]] and [[lumpia]] (which are all Indonesian names for the dishes). Dutch specialties such as [[croquette]]s and [[oliebollen]] are widely served in homes and restaurants.

[[File:Jurickson Profar (9260642222).jpg|thumb|[[Jurickson Profar]]]]
In 2004, the [[Little League Baseball]] team from Willemstad, Curaçao, won the world title in a game against the [[United States]] champion from [[Thousand Oaks, California]]. The Willemstad lineup included [[Jurickson Profar]], the standout shortstop prospect who now plays for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] of [[Major League Baseball]].

In the [[2006 World Baseball Classic]], Curaçaoans played for the Netherlands team. [[Shairon Martis]], born in [[Willemstad]], contributed to the Dutch team by throwing a seven-inning no-hitter against Panama (the game was stopped due to the [[mercy rule]]).

The 2010 documentary film, Boys of Summer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boysofsummerfilm.com/ |title=Boys of Summer |publisher=Boysofsummerfilm.com |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref> details Curaçao's Pabao Little League All-Stars winning their country's eighth straight championship at the 2008 Little League World Series, then going on to defeat other teams, including Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and earning a spot in Williamsport.

The prevailing trade winds and warm water make Curaçao a location for windsurfing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windsurfingcuracao.com/ |title=Curaçao's Caribbean sister islands, Aruba and Bonaire, are well known in the windsurfing world. Curaçao, which receives the same Caribbean trade winds as its siblings, has remained undiscovered by traveling windsurfers |publisher=Windsurfingcuracao.com |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}</ref><ref>Motion Magazine, June 2005</ref> One factor is that the deep water around Curaçao makes it difficult to lay marks for major windsurfing events, thus hindering the island's success as a windsurfing destination.

There is warm, clear water around the island. Scuba divers and snorkelers may have visibility up to 30&nbsp;m (98&nbsp;ft) at the Curaçao Underwater Marine Park, which stretches along {{convert|20|km|2|abbr=on}} of Curaçao's southern coastline.<ref>{{cite news|publisher= New York Times |title= Frommers Guide to Curaçao water sports |url=http://www.nytimes.com/frommers/travel/guides/caribbean-and-bermuda/curacao/frm_curacao_0178020606.html | date=20 November 2006}}</ref>

Curaçao participated in the [[2013 CARIFTA Games]]. Kevin Philbert stood third in the under-20 male Long Jump with a distance of 7.36m. Vanessa Philbert stood second the under-17 female 1500m with a time of 4:47.97.<ref name=cfpi_1>
