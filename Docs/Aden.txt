'''Aden''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|eɪ|d|ə|n}} {{respell|AY|duhn}}<span style="margin-left:1px;">,</span> {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ɑː|d|ɛ|n}} {{respell|AH|den}}<span style="margin-left:2px;">;</span> {{lang-ar|عدن}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|3=ʻAdin<span style="margin:2px;">/</span>ʻAdan&nbsp;}}'' <small>[[Yemeni Arabic|Yemeni]] pronunciation:</small> {{IPA-ar|ˈʕæden, ˈʕædæn|}}) is a [[port]] [[city]] in [[Yemen]], located by the eastern approach to the [[Red Sea]] (the [[Gulf of Aden]]), some {{convert|170|km}} east of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]].  Its population is approximately 800,000 people.  Aden's ancient, natural [[harbour]] lies in the crater of a dormant [[volcano]] which now forms a [[peninsula]], joined to the mainland by a low [[isthmus]].  This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient [[Kingdom of Awsan]] between the 5th and 7th centuries BC.  The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula. Aden gives its name to the [[Gulf of Aden]].

Aden consists of a number of distinct sub-centres: [[Crater (Yemen)|Crater]], the original port city; [[Ma'alla]], the modern port; [[Tawahi (Aden)|Tawahi]], known as "Steamer Point" in the colonial period; and the resorts of [[Gold Mohur]].  [[Khormaksar]], located on the isthmus that connects Aden proper with the mainland, includes the city's diplomatic missions, the main offices of [[Aden University]], and [[Aden International Airport]] (the former British Royal Air Force station [[RAF Khormaksar]]), Yemen's second biggest airport.  On the mainland are the sub-centres of [[Sheikh Othman]], a former [[oasis]] area; [[Al-Mansoura (Aden)|Al-Mansura]], a town planned by the British; and [[Madinat ash-Sha'b]] (formerly Madinat al-Itihad), the site designated as the capital of the [[South Arabian Federation]] and now home to a large power/[[desalinization]] facility and additional faculties of Aden University.

Aden encloses the eastern side of a vast, natural harbour that comprises the modern port.  The volcanic peninsula of Little Aden forms a near-mirror image, enclosing the harbour and port on the western side.  Little Aden became the site of the [[oil refinery]] and tanker port.  Both were established and operated by [[BP|British Petroleum]] until they were turned over to Yemeni government ownership and control in 1978.

Aden was the capital of the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]] until that country's unification with the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] in 1990, and again briefly served as Yemen's temporary capital during the [[Aftermath of the 2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état|aftermath]] of the [[2014–15 Yemeni coup d'état]], as declared by President [[Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi]] after he fled the [[Houthis|Houthi]] occupation of [[Sana'a]].<ref name="dw">{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/yemens-president-hadi-declares-new-temporary-capital/a-18332197|agency=Deutsche Welle|title=Yemen's President Hadi declares new 'temporary capital'|date=21 March 2015|accessdate=21 March 2015}}</ref> From March to July 2015, the [[Battle of Aden]] raged between Houthis and loyalists to President Hadi.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Aden|History of Yemen}}

===Antiquity===
A local legend in Yemen states that Aden may be as old as human history itself. Some also believe that [[Cain and Abel]] are buried somewhere in the city.<ref>Modern Middle East Nations and Their Strategic Place in the World: Yemen, 2004, by Hal Markovitz. ISBN 1-59084-521-8</ref>

The port's convenient position on the sea route between [[India]] and [[Europe]] has made Aden desirable to rulers who sought to possess it at various times throughout history. Known as [[Eudaemon]] ({{lang-grc|Ευδαίμων}}, meaning “blissful, prosperous,” in [[Ancient greek language|Ancient Greek]]) in the 1st century BC, it was a transshipping point for the Red Sea trade, but fell on hard times when new shipping practices by-passed it and made the daring direct crossing to India in the 1st century AD, according to the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]''. The same work describes Aden as "a village by the shore," which would well describe the town of Crater while it was still little-developed. There is no mention of fortification at this stage, Aden was more an island than a peninsula as the [[isthmus]] (a [[tombolo]]) was not then so developed as it is today.

===Medieval===
[[File:Hogenberg.Aden.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aden, with Portuguese fleet. in Braun & Hogenberg.1590]]
[[File:Stamp Aden 1951 2sh.jpg|right|130px|thumb|1951 [[Postage stamps|stamp]] depicting Steamer Point with the outside of the volcanic rim of Crater in the background]]
[[File:Stamp Aden 1937 0.5a.jpg|left|150px|thumb|1937 stamp of Aden: Half-anna [[dhow]]]]

Although the pre-Islamic [[Himyar]] civilization was capable of building large structures, there seems to have been little fortification at this stage. Fortifications at Mareb and other places in Yemen and the [[Hadhramaut]] make it clear that both the Himyar and the [[Sabaeans|Sabean]] cultures were well capable of it. Thus, watch towers, since destroyed, are possible. However, the Arab historians Ibn al Mojawir and Abu Makhramah attribute the first fortification of Aden to Beni Zuree'a. Abu Makhramah has also included a detailed biography of Muhammad Azim Sultan Qamarbandi Naqsh in his work, Tarikh ul-Yemen. The aim seems to have been twofold: to keep hostile forces out and to maintain revenue by controlling the movement of goods, thereby preventing smuggling. In its original form, some of this work was relatively feeble.

After 1175 AD, rebuilding in a more solid form began, and ever since Aden became a popular city attracting sailors and merchants from [[Egypt]], [[Sindh]], [[Gujarat]], [[East Africa]] and even [[China]]. According to [[Muqaddasi]], Persians formed the majority of Aden's population in the 10th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Persian Gulf in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncfIAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA180&dq|author=Lawrence G. Potter|date=2009|page=180}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Security and Territoriality in the Persian Gulf: A Maritime Political Geography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUL8AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA64&dq|author=Dr Pirouz Mojtahed-Zadeh|date=2013|page=64}}</ref>

In 1421, China's Ming dynasty [[Yongle Emperor]] ordered principal envoy grand eunuch Li Xing and grand eunuch Zhou Man of [[Zheng He]]'s fleet to convey an imperial edict with hats and robes to bestow on the king of Aden. The envoys boarded three treasure ships and [[Treasure voyages|set sail from Sumatra to the port of Aden]]. This event was recorded in the book ''Yingyai Shenglan'' by [[Ma Huan]] who accompanied the imperial envoy.<ref>[[Ma Huan]] Ying-yai Sheng-lan, The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores, 1433, translated by J.V.G. Mills, with foreword and preface, Hakluty Society, London 1970; reprinted by the White Lotus Press 1997. ISBN 974-8496-78-3</ref>

===British administration 1839–1967===

{{main|Colony of Aden}}{{see also|State of Aden}}

[[File:Aden postcard.jpg|thumb|Port of Aden (around 1910).  Ships lying off Steamer Point at the entrance to the modern inner harbour.<ref>[http://www.portofaden.com/Aden.JPG Port of Aden inner harbour]</ref>]]
[[File:Aden. Esplanade Road, Crater, late 1930s.jpg|thumb|Esplanade Road in the late 1930s]]

Before British administration, Aden was occupied by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] between 1513–1538 and 1547–1548. It was ruled by the [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1538–1547 and 1548–1645.

In 1609 ''The Ascension'' was the first English ship to visit Aden, before sailing on to [[Mocha (port)|Mocha]] during the Fourth voyage of the [[East India Company]].<ref>J. K. Laughton, ‘[[Jourdain, John]] (c.1572–1619)’, rev. H. V. Bowen, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008</ref>

After Ottoman rule, Aden was ruled by the [[Sultanate of Lahej]], under suzerainty of the Zaidi imams of Yemen.

Aden was at this time{{when|date=April 2016}} a small village with a population of 600 Arabs, Somalis, Jews and Indians—housed for the most part in huts of reed matting erected among ruins recalling a vanished era of wealth and prosperity. In 1838, under [[Muhsin bin Fadl]], Lahej ceded {{convert|194|km2}} including Aden to the [[British Empire|British]]. On 19 January 1839, the [[British East India Company]] landed [[Royal Marines]] at Aden to secure the territory and stop attacks by [[pirate]]s against British shipping to [[India]]. In 1850 it was declared a free trade port with the liquor, salt, arms, and opium trades developing duties as it won all the coffee trade from [[Mokha]].<ref>Great Britain. Hydrographic Office. (1900). The Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot. London: Admiralty. p. 348. Retrieved 21 June 2015. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EVDNAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Books]</ref>  The port lies about equidistant from the [[Suez Canal]], [[Mumbai]], and [[Zanzibar]], which were all important British possessions. Aden had been an [[entrepôt]] and a way-station for seamen in the ancient world.  There, supplies, particularly water, were replenished, so, in the mid-19th century, it became necessary to replenish [[coal]] and boiler water.  Thus Aden acquired a coaling station at Steamer Point and Aden was to remain under British control until 1967.

Until 1937, Aden was governed as part of [[British Raj|British India]] and was known as the [[Aden Settlement]].  Its original territory was enlarged in 1857 by the 13&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> island of [[Perim]], in 1868 by the 73&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> [[Khuriya Muriya Islands]], and in 1915 by the 108&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> island of [[Kamaran]]. The settlement would become [[Aden Province]] in 1935.

In 1937, the Settlement was detached from India and became the [[Aden (colony)|Colony of Aden]], a British [[Crown colony]].  The change in government was a step towards the change in monetary units seen in the stamps illustrating this article.  When [[British India]] became independent in 1947, Indian rupees (divided into annas) were replaced in Aden by [[East African shilling]]s.  The [[hinterland]] of Aden and [[Hadhramaut]] were also loosely tied to Britain as the [[Aden Protectorate]] which was overseen from Aden.

[[File:Stamp Aden 1939 2.5a.jpg|left|thumb|Aden is known for its boat-oriented [[Postage stamps|stamps]].  Mukalla is on the Hadhramaut coast, about {{convert|500|km|0|abbr=on}} east of Aden, in what was then the Aden Protectorate.]]
Aden's location also made it a useful entrepôt for [[mail]] passing between places around the [[Indian Ocean]] and Europe. Thus, a ship passing from Suez to Bombay could leave mail for [[Mombasa]] at Aden for collection. See [[Postage stamps and postal history of Aden]].

The [[1947 Aden riots]] saw more than 80 Jews killed, their property looted and schools burned by a Muslim mob.

After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, Aden became the main location in the region for the British.

Aden sent a team of two to the [[1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]].

====Little Aden 1955 to 1967====
[[File:Mualla Main Road.JPG|thumb|Mualla Main Road, 1966]]
Little Aden is still dominated by the [[oil refinery]] built for [[BP|British Petroleum]].  Little Aden was well known to seafarers for its tanker port with a very welcoming seaman's mission near to the BP Aden [[tugboat|tugs']] [[jetty|jetties]], complete with swimming pool and air conditioned bar.  The accommodation areas for the refinery personnel were known by the original Arabic names of Bureika and Ghadir.

Bureika was wooden housing bunkhouses built to accommodate the thousands of skilled men and labourers imported to build the refinery, later converted to family housing, plus imported prefabricated houses "the [[Riley-Newsums]]" that are also to be found in parts of Australia (Woomera).  Bureika also had a protected bathing area and Beach Club.

Ghadir housing was stone built, largely from the local [[granite]] [[quarry]]; much of this housing still stands today, now occupied by wealthier locals from  Aden.  Little Aden also has a local township and numerous picturesque fishing villages, including the Lobster Pots of Ghadir.  The British Army had extensive camps in Bureika and through Silent Valley in Falaise Camp, these successfully protected the refinery staff and facilities throughout the troubles, with only a very few exceptions.  Schooling was provided for children from kindergarten age through to primary school, after that, children were bussed to The Isthmus School in Khormaksar, though this had to be stopped during the Aden Emergency.

===Federation of South Arabia and the Aden Emergency===
[[File:Aden02 flickr.jpg|thumb|right|Aden in 1960]]
{{main|Federation of South Arabia|Aden Emergency}}
In order to stabilise Aden and the surrounding Aden Protectorate from the designs of the Egyptian backed republicans of [[North Yemen]], the British attempted to gradually unite the disparate states of the region in preparation for eventual independence.  On 18 January 1963, the Colony of Aden was incorporated into the [[Federation of Arab Emirates of the South]] against the wishes of North Yemen.  The city became the '''[[State of Aden]]''' and the Federation was renamed the [[Federation of South Arabia]] (FSA).

An insurgency against British administration known as the [[Aden Emergency]] began with a grenade attack by the communist's [[National Liberation Front (Yemen)|National Liberation Front]] (NLF), against the British High Commissioner on 10 December 1963, killing one person and injuring fifty, and a "state of emergency" was declared.

In 1964, Britain announced its intention to grant independence to the FSA in 1968, but that the British military would remain in Aden.  The security situation deteriorated as NLF and FLOSY (Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen) vied for the upper hand.

In January 1967, there were mass riots between the NLF and their rival FLOSY supporters in the old Arab quarter of Aden town.  This conflict continued until mid February, despite the intervention of British troops.  During the period there were as many attacks on the British troops by both sides as against each other culminating in the destruction of an [[Aden Airways]] [[Douglas DC-3|DC3]] plane in the air with no survivors.

The increased violence was a determining factor in the British ensuring all families were evacuated quicker than initially intended, as recorded in "From Barren Rocks to Living Stones".

On 30 November 1967 British troops were evacuated, leaving Aden and the rest of the FSA under NLF control.  The [[Royal Marines]], who had been the first British troops to arrive in Aden in 1839, were the last to leave — with the exception of a Royal Engineer detachment (10 Airfields Squadron left Aden on 13 December 1967).

===Independence===
{{see also|South Yemen}}
[[File:Aden,Yemen Port.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View of Aden from the sea]]
Aden became the capital of the new [[People's Republic of South Yemen]] which, in 1970, was renamed the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]].  With the [[Yemeni unification|unification]] of [[Yemen Arab Republic|northern]] and southern Yemen in 1990, Aden was no longer a national capital but remained the capital of ''Aden Governorate''' which covered an area similar to that of the Aden Colony.

On 29 December 1992, [[Al Qaeda]] conducted its first known [[terrorism|terrorist]] attack in Aden, bombing the [[Gold Mohur Hotel]] {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɡ|oʊ|l|d|_|ˈ|m|ɔər}}, where US servicemen were known to have been staying en route to [[Somalia]] for [[Operation Restore Hope]].  A Yemeni and an Austrian tourist died in the attack.<ref name="pbs-1stattack">{{cite web

Aden was briefly the centre of the [[secession]]ist [[Democratic Republic of Yemen]] from 21 May 1994 but was reunited by [[Yemen|Republic of Yemen]] troops on 7 July 1994.

Members of al Qaeda attempted to bomb the US guided-missile destroyer [[USS The Sullivans (DDG-68)|''The Sullivans'']] at the port of Aden as part of the [[2000 millennium attack plots]]. The boat that had the explosives in it sank, forcing the planned attack to be aborted.

The [[USS Cole bombing|bombing attack on destroyer USS ''Cole'']] took place in Aden on 12 October 2000.

In 2007 growing dissatisfaction with unification led to the formation of the secessionist [[South Yemen Movement]]. According to the New York Times, the Movement's mainly underground leadership includes socialists, Islamists and individuals desiring a return to the perceived benefits of the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/world/middleeast/28yemen.html |title=In Yemen’s South, Protests Could Cause More Instability |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 28, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-08 |first=Robert F. |last=Worth |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304233745/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/28/world/middleeast/28yemen.html |archivedate= 4 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

==Economy==
Historically, Aden would import goods from the African coast and from Europe, the [[United States]], and [[India]].<ref name=Prothero68>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

Stationery Office|location=London|page=69|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/69/}}</ref> As of 1920, the British described it as "the chief emporium of Arabian trade, receiving the small quantities of native produce, and supplying the modest wants of the interior and of most of the smaller Arabian ports." At the docks, the city provided [[coal]] to passing ships. The only item being produced by the city, as of 1920, was [[salt]].<ref name=Prothero69/> Also, the port was the stop ships had to take when entering the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]]; this was how cities like Mecca had received goods by ship. [[Yemenia|Yemen Airlines]], the national airline of South Yemen, had its head office in Aden.  On 15 May 1996, Yemen Airlines merged with [[Yemenia]].<ref>"North and South Yemen Airlines to Merge". ''Flight International''. 10–16 April 1996.

Retrieved on 26 October 2009.</ref>

During the early 20th century Aden was a notable centre of [[coffee]] production. Women processed coffee beans, grown in the Yemen highlands.<ref name=Prothero83>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=83|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/83/}}</ref> [[Frankincense]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[alfalfa]], and [[millet]] was also produced and exported from Aden.<ref name=Prothero84>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

Stationery Office|location=London|page=86|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/86/}}</ref> The leaves and stalks of the alfalfa, millet and [[maize]] produced in Aden were generally used as [[fodder]].<ref name=Prothero86/> As of 1920, Aden was also gathering [[salt]] from [[Seawater|salt water]]. An [[Italy|Italian]] company called Agostino Burgarella Ajola and Company gathered and process the salt under the name Aden Salt Works. There was also a smaller company from [[India]], called Abdullabhoy and Joomabhoy Lalji & Company that owned a salt production firm in Aden. Both companies exported the salt. Between 1916-1917, Aden produced over 120,000 tons of salt. Aden has also produced [[potash]], which was generally exported to Mumbai.<ref name=Prothero98>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|page=98|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11767/view/1/98/}}</ref>

Aden produced [[jollyboat]]s. [[Charcoal]] was produced as well, from [[acacia]], and mainly in the interior of the region. [[Cigarette]]s were produced by [[Jews|Jewish]] and [[Greek people|Greek]] populations in Aden. The [[tobacco]] used was imported from Egypt.<ref name=Prothero99>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Arabia|year=1920|publisher=H.M.

==Transportation==
[[File:Aden03 flickr.jpg|thumb|right|Aden's harbour in 1960]]

Historically, Aden's [[harbour]] has been a major hub of transportation for the region. As of 1920, the harbour was {{convert|8|by|4|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=flip|0}} in size. Passenger ships landed at Steamer Point now called [[Tawahi (Aden)|Tawahi]].<ref name="Prothero68"/>

On 1 January 1977, Aden changed to driving on the right, in line with the configuration of neighbouring states.

The city was served by [[Aden International Airport]], the former [[RAF Khormaksar]] station which is {{convert|10|km|0}} away from the city, before the [[Battle of Aden Airport]] and the [[2015 military intervention in Yemen]] closed this airport along with other airports in Yemen. July 22, [[Aden International Airport]] was declared fit for operation again after the Houthi forces were driven from the city, and a Saudi plane carrying aid reportedly became the first plane to land in Aden in four months.<ref>{{cite news|title=Aden Airport ready to operate|url=http://www.yementimes.com/?liveblog.item.id=64|accessdate=27 July 2015|work=[[Yemen Times]]|date=22 July 2015}}</ref> The same day, a ship chartered by the [[World Food Programme]] carrying fuel docked in Aden's port.<ref>{{cite news|title=New WFP Ship Arrives In Aden Port With Fuel For Humanitarian Operations|url=https://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/new-wfp-ship-arrives-aden-port-fuel-humanitarian-operations|accessdate=30 July 2015|work=World Food Programme|publisher=United Nations|date=22 July 2015}}</ref>
