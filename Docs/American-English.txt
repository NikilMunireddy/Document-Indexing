The use of English in the United States is a result of [[British colonization of the Americas]]. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in [[North America]] during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since then, American English has been influenced by the languages of [[West Africa]], the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population, [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the United States.

Any American English [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] or sound system perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural markers is popularly called [[General American]], described by [[William Labov]] as "a fairly uniform broadcast standard in the mass media," but otherwise not justified as a mainstream standard dialect by either historical or present linguistic evidence.<ref>Labov, William (2012).

Pre-publication draft. p. 55.</ref> On the contrary, American English is increasingly evolving into an ever-wider spectrum of dialects, though several are closely related.

{{Main|Regional vocabularies of American English|North American English regional phonology}}

While written American English is (in general) standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary. In 2010, [[William Labov]], co-author of the ''[[Atlas of North American English]]'', summarized the complex overview of American regional dialects as follows.<ref>Labov, William (2010). ''[http://www.cogsci.msu.edu/DSS/2011-2012/Labov/POLC%20Chapters%201-3.pdf The Politics of Language Change: Dialect Divergence in America]''. The University of Virginia Press. Pre-publication draft. p. 53-4.</ref> Some American English has undergone "vigorous new sound changes" since about the mid-nineteenth century onwards, spawning [[Mid-Atlantic American English|Mid-Atlantic]] (centered on [[Philadelphia, PA|Philadelphia]] and [[Baltimore, MD|Baltimore]]), [[Western Pennsylvania English|Western Pennsylvania]] (centered on [[Pittsburgh, PA|Pittsburgh]]), [[Inland Northern American English|Inland Northern]] (centered on [[Chicago, IL|Chicago]], [[Detroit, MI|Detroit]], and the [[Great Lakes region]]), [[Midland American English|Midland]] (centered on [[Indianapolis, IN|Indianapolis]], [[Columbus, OH|Columbus]], and [[Kansas City, MO|Kansas City]]) and [[Western American English|Western dialects]], all of which "are now more different from each other than they were fifty or a hundred years ago." Meanwhile, the unique features of the [[Eastern New England English|Eastern New England]] (centered on [[Boston, MA|Boston]]) and [[New York City English|New York City dialects]] seem to be stable. "On the other hand, dialects of many smaller cities have receded in favor of the new regional patterns"; for example, the traditional dialects of [[Charleston, SC|Charleston]] and of [[Cincinnati, OH|Cincinnati]] have given way to the general Midland dialect, and of [[St. Louis, MO|St. Louis]] now approaches the sounds of the Inland Northern dialect. At the same time, the [[Southern American English|Southern dialect]] "is on the whole slowly receding: younger speakers everywhere in the South are shifting away from the marked features of Southern speech," while the [[High Tider|"Hoi Toider" dialect]] shows the paradox of receding among younger speakers in North Carolina's [[Outer Banks]] islands, yet strengthening among speakers in the islands of the [[Chesapeake Bay]].

|style="text-align:left"| {{Map of American English}} The map above shows the major regional dialects of American English (each designated in all capital letters) plus other local varieties, as demarcated primarily by Labov et al.'s ''[[Atlas of North American English]]'',<ref>{{cite book|author1=Labov, William |author2=Ash, Sharon |author3=Boberg, Charles |title=Atlas of North American English: Phonetics, Phonology and Sound Change|year=2006|page=148|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|location=Berlin/New York|isbn=3-11-016746-8}}</ref> as well as the related Telsur Project's [http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/home.html#regional regional maps]. Any region may also contain speakers of "[[General American]]," a mainstream umbrella accent widely perceived as being spoken throughout the United States. Furthermore, this map does not account for speakers of ethnic, cultural, or other not-strictly-regional varieties (such as [[African-American Vernacular English]], [[Chicano English]], [[Cajun English]], etc.). All regional American English dialects, unless specifically stated otherwise, are [[rhoticity in English|rhotic]], with the [[father–bother merger|''father–bother'' merger]], [[Mary–marry–merry merger|''Mary–marry–merry'' merger]], and [[Pronunciation of English ⟨a⟩#/æ/ tensing|pre-nasal "short ''a''" tensing]].<ref group=note>Dialects are considered "[[rhoticity in English|rhotic]]" if they pronounce the ''r'' sound in all historical environments, without ever "dropping" this sound. The [[father–bother merger|''father–bother'' merger]] is the pronunciation of the unrounded {{IPAc-en|ɒ}} vowel variant (as in ''cot, lot, bother'', etc.) the same as the {{IPAc-en|ɑː}} vowel (as in ''spa, haha, Ma''), causing words like ''con'' and ''Kahn'' and like ''sob'' and ''[[Saab Automobile|Saab]]'' to [[homophone|sound identical]], with the vowel usually realized in the back or middle of the mouth as {{IPA|[ɑ~ä]}}. Finally, most of the U.S. participates in a continuous nasal system of the "short ''a''" vowel (in ''cat, trap, bath'', etc.), causing {{IPA|/æ/}} to be pronounced with the tongue raised and with a glide quality (typically sounding like {{IPA|[ɛə]}}) particularly when before a [[nasal consonant]]; thus, ''mad'' is {{IPA|[mæd]}}, but ''man'' is more like {{IPA|[mɛən]}}.</ref>

===East Coast===
Traditionally, the "East Coast" comprises three or four major linguistically distinct regions, each of which possesses English varieties both distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse: [[New England]], the [[New York metropolitan area]], the [[Mid-Atlantic states]] (centering on Philadelphia and Baltimore), and the [[Southern United States]]. The only [[rhoticity in English|''r''-dropping]] regional accents of American English are all spoken along the East Coast, and today specifically by some older Southerners, New York City natives, and eastern New Englanders. After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U.S. led to dialect mixing and leveling, ([[koineization]]) so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the [[East]]ern [[Coast|seaboard]]. The [[Connecticut River]] and [[Long Island Sound]] is usually regarded as the southern/western extent of New England speech, which has its roots in the speech of the Puritans from [[East Anglia]] who settled in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].

The [[Potomac River]] generally divides a group of Northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the Coastal Southern dialect area; in between these two rivers several local variations exist, chief among them the one that prevails in and around [[New York City]] and northern [[New Jersey]], which developed on a Dutch [[substratum]] after the English conquered New Amsterdam. The main features of Coastal Southern speech can be traced to the speech of the English from the [[West Country]] who settled in Virginia after leaving England at the time of the [[English Civil War]].

===Midwest===
A distinctive speech pattern also appears near the border between [[Canada]] and the United States, centered on the [[Great Lakes]] region (but only on the American side). Linguists call this region the "[[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]]", as defined by its unique [[Northern cities vowel shift|vowel shift]]—occurring in the same region whose "standard Midwestern" speech was the basis for [[General American]] in the mid-20th century (though prior to this recent vowel shift). Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below, referring to both, plus areas to the immediate west of the Great Lakes region, all collectively as "[[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]]": a common but vaguely delineated term for what is now the central or north-central United States. The so-called '"[[North Central American English|Minnesotan]]" dialect is also prevalent in the cultural [[Upper Midwest]], and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region (like "yah" for yes, pronounced similarly to "ja" in German, Norwegian and Swedish). In parts of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]], another dialect known as [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] is also spoken.

===Midland===
Between the traditional American "North" and "South" is what linguists have long called the "Midland." This geographically overlaps with some states situated in the lower Midwest. West of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] begins the broad zone of modern-day "[[Midland American English|Midland]]" speech. This is divided into two discrete subdivisions, the "North Midland" that begins north of the [[Ohio River]] valley area, and the "South Midland" speech, which to the American ear has a slight trace of a "[[Southern American English|Southern accent]]"; sometimes the former region is designated simply "Midland" and the latter is labelled as "Highland Southern".

The South Midland or Highland Southern dialect follows the [[Ohio River]] in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] west of the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi]], and peters out in [[West Texas]]. It is a version of the Midland speech that has assimilated some coastal Southern forms (outsiders often mistakenly believe South Midland speech and coastal South speech to be the same).

===West===
A generalized Midland speech continues westward until becoming a somewhat internally diverse [[Western American English|Western dialect]] (mostly unified by the [[cot–caught merger]] and [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]] pronunciation of the ''o'' sound in ''goat, toe, show'', etc.), which itself contains such distinct sub-types as [[Pacific Northwest English]] as well as [[California English]], although in the immediate [[San Francisco]] area some older speakers do not possess the cot–caught merger and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which reflects a historical Mid-Atlantic heritage.

The island state of Hawaii, though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a [[creole language]] known commonly as [[Hawaiian Pidgin]].

===Elsewhere===
Although no longer region-specific,<ref>Cf. Trudgill, p.42.</ref> [[African American Vernacular English]], which remains prevalent among [[African Americans]], has a close relationship to Southern varieties of American English and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans.

Dialect development in the United States has further been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Cleveland]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Miami]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], etc. which imposed their linguistic marks on the surrounding areas.

Compared with [[English language in England|English as spoken in England]], North American English<ref>''[[North American English]]'' (Trudgill, p. 2) is a collective term used for the varieties of the English language that are spoken in both the United States and [[Canada]].</ref> is more homogeneous, and any accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as "[[General American]]". Some distinctive accents can be found on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] (for example, in eastern [[New England]], New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore) partly because these areas were in close contact with [[England]] and imitated prestigious varieties of English at a time when these were undergoing changes.<ref>Trudgill, pp. 46–47.</ref> In addition, many speech communities on the East Coast have existed in their present locations for centuries, while the interior of the country was settled by people from all regions of the existing United States and developed a far more general linguistic pattern.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Studies on historical usage of English in the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply evolve from period British English, but rather retained many archaic features contemporary [[British English]] has since lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-difference-between-theater-and-theatre.htm |title=What Is the Difference between Theater and Theatre? |publisher=Wisegeek.org |date=2015-05-15 |accessdate=2015-06-01}}</ref> Most North American speech is [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic]], because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was rhotic.

A unique "bunched tongue" variant of the approximant ''r'' sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.<ref>''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann & Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 317.</ref> The loss of the ''r'' sound after a vowel (for example, causing ''spar'' to sound like ''spa''), known as non-rhoticity, is confined in the United States mostly to the accents of [[New England English|eastern New England]], the [[older Southern American English|former plantation South]], [[New York City English|metropolitan New York City]], and African American Vernacular English; nowadays, the vowel-consonant cluster found in "bird", "work", "hurt", "learn", etc. usually retains its ''r'' pronunciation, even in otherwise non-rhotic accents. On the other hand, dropping of syllable-final ''r'' may sometimes happen in natively rhotic dialects if ''r'' is located in unaccented syllables wherein the next syllable or word begins in a consonant (for example, many North Americans drop the first 'r' in "particular"). In England, the lost ''r'' was often changed into {{IPA|[ə]}} ([[schwa]]), giving rise to a new class of falling [[diphthong]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Furthermore, the ''er'' sound of ''f'''ur''''' or ''butt'''er''''', is realized in AmE as a [[monophthong]]al [[r-colored vowel]] (stressed {{IPA|[ɝ]}} or unstressed {{IPA|[ɚ]}} as represented in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This does not happen in the non-rhotic varieties of North American speech.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Some other English changes in which most North American dialects do not participate:
* The realization of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} as a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} (as in {{IPA|[ˈbʌʔɚ]}} for ''butter''). The only environment in which t-glottalization is standard in American English is before syllabic {{IPA|/n/}}, as in "button" {{IPA|[ˈbʌʔn̩]}}.

On the other hand, North American English has undergone some sound changes not found in other varieties of English speech:
* The [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father–bother merger|merger of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɒ/}}]], making ''father'' and ''bother'' rhyme. This change is in a transitional or completed stage nearly universally in North American English. Exceptions are in northeastern [[New England English]], such as the [[Boston accent]], [[New York City English]], [[Philadelphia English]], [[Baltimore English]], and many [[Southern American English|Southern dialects]], such as the [[Yat dialect]].<ref name=Wells>{{cite book |author=[[John C.

* [[English-language vowel changes before historic r|Vowel merger]] before intervocalic {{IPA|/ɹ/}}. Which vowels are affected varies between dialects, but the [[Mary–marry–merry merger|Mary-marry-merry]], [[Mirror–nearer merger|nearer-mirror]], and [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Hurry–furry merger|hurry–furry]] mergers are found in many American English dialects. Americans vary slightly in their pronunciations of [[R-colored vowel#Rhotacization|R-colored vowels]]&mdash;such as those in {{IPA|/ɛəɹ/}} and {{IPA|/ɪəɹ/}}&mdash;sometimes monophthongizing towards {{IPA|[ɛɹ]}} and {{IPA|[ɪɹ]}} or [[tenseness|tensing]] towards {{IPA|[eɪɹ]}} and {{IPA|[i(ə)ɹ]}} respectively, causing pronunciations like {{IPA|[pʰeɪɹ]}} for ''pair''/''pear'' and {{IPA|[pʰiəɹ]}} for ''peer''/''pier''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Accents of English|volume=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=J. C. Wells|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=484eVQ7t8TMC&dq=accents+of+english+cambridge&q=481#v=onepage&q=%22long%20vowels%20before%20%2Fr%2F%22&f|pages=481–482}}</ref> Also, {{IPA|/jʊər/}} is often reduced to {{IPA|[jɚ]}}, so that ''cure'', ''pure'', and ''mature'' may all end with the sound {{IPA|[ɚ]}}, thus rhyming with ''blur'' and ''sir''. The word ''sure'' is also part of this rhyming set as commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ʃɚ]}}.
* [[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-dropping|Dropping of {{IPA|/j/}}]] is more extensive than in RP. In most North American accents, {{IPA|/j/}} is dropped after all [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and interdental consonant, so that ''new, duke, Tuesday, presume'' are pronounced {{IPA|[nu]}}, {{IPA|[duk]}}, {{IPA|[ˈtʰuzdeɪ]}}, {{IPA|[pʰɹɪˈzum]}}.
* [[æ-tensing|/æ/ tensing]] in environments that vary widely from accent to accent. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/æ/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/æ/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of "continuum" of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/æ/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[eə̯]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[æ]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[mæs]}} for ''mass'',  but {{IPA|[meə̯n]}} for ''man''). In some American accents, though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[eə̯]}} are entirely separate (or "split") phonemes, for example, in '''''planet''''' {{IPA|[pʰɫænɪ̈t̚]}} vs. '''''plan it''''' {{IPA|[pʰɫeənɪ̈t̚]}}. This is often called the Mid-Atlantic [[Phonological history of English short A#Phonemic æ tensing in the Mid-Atlantic region|split-''a'']] system. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction in the mouth compared to the backed British "broad A" the phenomenon has been noted as related to the increasingly rare phenomenon of older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area who {{IPA|/æ/}} to {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (the so-called "[[broad A]]") before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /θ/, /ð/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.

{{/æ/ tensing in North American English}}

* [[Flapping]] of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} before unstressed vowels (as in ''bu'''tt'''er'' {{IPA|[ˈbʌɾəɹ]}}, ''par'''t'''y'' {{IPA|[ˈpʰɑɹɾi]}}) and syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} (''bo'''tt'''le'' {{IPA|[ˈbɑɾəɫ]}}), as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel (''wha'''t''' else'' {{IPA|[wʌˈɾɛɫs]}}, ''wha'''t'''ever'' {{IPA|[wʌˈɾɛvəɹ]}}). Thus, for most speakers, pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' are pronounced the same, except with the stressed {{IPA|/aɪ/}} (see below).
* [[Canadian raising]] of {{IPA|/aɪ/}}: many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/aɪ/}} based on its presence before either a voiceless or voiced consonant, so that in ''writer'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} but in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[äɪ]}}. This is a form of [[Canadian raising]] but, unlike more extreme forms of that process, does not affect {{IPA|/aʊ/}}. In many areas and idiolects, a phonemic distinction between what elsewhere become homophones through this process is maintained by vowel lengthening in the vowel preceding the formerly voiced consonant, ''e.g.'', {{IPA|[ˈɹʌɪɾɚ]}} for "writer" as opposed to {{IPA|[ˈɹäɪɾɚ]}} for "rider".
*[[T glottalization]] is common when {{IPA|/t/}} is in the final position of a syllable or word (''get'', ''fretful'': {{IPA|[ɡɛʔ]}}, {{IPA|[ˈfɹɛʔfəɫ]}}), though this is always superseded by the aforementioned rules of flapping
*L-velarization: England's typical distinction between a "clear L" (i.e. [[l (IPA)|{{IPA|[l]}}]]) and a "dark L" (i.e. [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[ɫ]}}]] or sometimes even [[Velar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[ʟ]}}]]) is much less noticeable in nearly all dialects of American English; it may even be altogether absent.<ref>{{cite book|title=Language Talent and Brain Activity: Trends in Applied Linguistics|editors=Grzegorz Dogil, Susanne Maria Reiterer, and Walter de Gruyter|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|page=299|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pfIGxRtdXsQC&pg=PA299&dq="general+american"+"velarized"}}</ref> Instead, most U.S. speakers pronounce all "L" sounds with a tendency to be "dark", meaning with some degree of [[velarization]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Wells|1982|p=490}}</ref> The only notable exceptions to this are in some Spanish-influenced U.S. English varieties (such as [[New York Latino English|East Coast Latino English]], which typically shows a clear "L" in [[syllable onset]]s) and in older, [[wikt:moribund|moribund]] [[Southern American English|Southern speech]] of the U.S., where "L" is clear in an [[intervocalic consonant|intervocalic]] environment between [[front vowel]]s.<ref>''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann & Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 319.</ref>
* Both intervocalic {{IPA|/nt/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} may commonly be realized as {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}} or simply {{IPA|[n]}}, making ''winter'' and ''winner'' homophones. In most areas where {{IPA|/nt/}} is reduced to {{IPA|/n/}}, it is accompanied further by nasalization of simple post-vocalic {{IPA|/n/}}{{vague|date=April 2014}}, so that {{IPA|/Vnt/}} and {{IPA|/Vn/}} remain phonemically distinct. In such cases, the preceding vowel becomes nasalized, and is followed in cases where the former {{IPA|/nt/}} was present, by a distinct{{vague|date=April 2014}} {{IPA|/n/}}. This stop-absorption by the preceding nasal {{IPA|/n/}} does not occur when the second syllable is stressed, as in ''entail''.
*The [[Phonological history of the high front vowels#Pin–pen merger|pin–pen merger]] occurs in certain areas, by which {{IPA|[ɛ]}} is raised to {{IPA|[ɪ]}} before nasal stops, making pairs like ''pen/pin'' [[homophonous]]. This merger originated in [[Southern American English]] but is now also sometimes found in parts of the Midwest and West as well, especially in people with roots in the mountainous areas of the [[Southeastern United States]].
*The vowel {{IPA|/ɪ/}} in unstressed syllables generally merges with {{IPA|/ə/}} ([[Phonological history of English high front vowels#Weak-vowel merger|weak-vowel merger]]), so ''roses'' is pronounced like ''Rosa's''.

Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
*[[Horse–hoarse merger|merger]] of the vowels {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before 'r', making pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning,'' etc. [[homophones]].
*[[wine–whine merger]] making pairs like ''wine/whine, wet/whet, Wales/whales, wear/where,'' etc. [[homophone]]s, in most cases eliminating {{IPA|/ʍ/}}, the [[voiceless labiovelar fricative]]. Many older varieties of southern and western American English still keep these distinct, but the merger appears to be spreading.

==Vocabulary==
North America has given the English [[lexicon]] many thousands of words, meanings, and phrases. Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally.

===Creation of an American lexicon===
{{Refimprove|subsection|date=June 2009}}

Among the earliest and most notable regular "English" additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, ''run, branch, fork, [[wikt:snag|snag]], [[hill|bluff]], [[gulch]], neck'' (of the woods), ''barrens, [[bottomland]], notch, knob, riffle, [[rapid]]s, watergap, cutoff, [[trail]], [[tree line|timberline]]'' and ''[[water divide|divide]].''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Already existing words such as ''[[stream|creek]], [[swamp|slough]], [[Ice pellets|sleet]]'' and (in later use) ''[[Drainage basin|watershed]]'' received new meanings that were unknown in England.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Other noteworthy American [[toponym]]s are found among loanwords; for example, ''[[prairie]], [[butte]]'' (French); ''[[bayou]]'' ([[Choctaw]] via Louisiana French); ''[[coulee]]'' (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); ''[[canyon]], [[mesa]], [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]'' (Spanish); ''vlei, skate, [[kill (body of water)|kill]]'' (Dutch, [[Hudson Valley]]).

The word ''[[wikt:corn|corn]]'', used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant ''[[Zea mays]]'', the most important crop in the U.S., originally named ''[[Indian corn]]'' by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as ''[[grain]]''. Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by ''[[barn]]'' (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and ''team'' (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms ''[[rangeland|range]], [[corn crib|(corn) crib]], [[truck farm|truck]], [[grain elevator|elevator]], [[sharecropping]]'' and ''[[feedlot]].''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

''[[Ranch]],'' later applied to a [[ranch house|house style]], derives from [[Mexican Spanish]]; most Spanish contributions came after the [[War of 1812]], with the opening of the West. Among these are, other than toponyms, ''[[chaps]]'' (from ''chaparreras), [[plaza]], [[lasso]], [[bronco]], [[Wikt:buckaroo|buckaroo]], [[rodeo]];'' examples of "English" additions from the [[cowboy]] era are ''bad man,{{clarify|date=September 2015}} maverick, chuck'' ("food") and ''[[Boot Hill]];'' from the [[California Gold Rush]] came such idioms as ''hit pay dirt'' or ''strike it rich.'' The word ''blizzard'' probably originated in the West. A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb ''belittle'' and the noun ''bid,'' both first used in writing by [[Thomas Jefferson]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts ''(land office, [[Land lot|lot]], outlands, waterfront,'' the verbs ''locate'' and ''relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision),'' types of property ''([[log cabin]], [[adobe]]'' in the 18th century; ''[[frame house]], [[apartment]], tenement house, [[shack]], [[Wikt:shanty|shanty]]'' in the 19th century; ''project, [[condominium]], [[townhouse]], [[split-level home|split-level]], [[mobile home]], multi-family'' in the 20th century), and parts thereof ''([[driveway]], breezeway, [[backyard]], dooryard; [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]], [[siding]], trim, [[baseboard]]; stoop'' (from Dutch), ''family room, den;'' and, in recent years, ''[[HVAC]], [[central air]], walkout basement).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Ever since the [[American Revolution]], a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are ''run (i.e, for office), gubernatorial, [[primary election]], [[carpetbagger]]'' (after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]), ''repeater'', ''[[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]'' (a [[United Kingdom|British]] term used originally in Banking)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.word-detective.com/back-f.html |title=Lame Duck |publisher=Word Detective.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> and ''[[pork barrel]].'' Some of these are internationally used (for example, ''[[caucus]], [[gerrymander]], [[filibuster]], [[exit poll]]).''

====19th century onwards====
The development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms. Typical examples are the vocabulary of ''[[railroad]]ing'' (see further at [[rail terminology]]) and ''[[transport]]ation'' terminology, ranging from names of roads (from ''dirt roads'' and ''back roads'' to ''[[freeway]]s'' and ''[[parkway]]s)'' to road infrastructure ''([[parking lot]], [[overpass]], [[rest area]]),'' and from automotive terminology to ''[[public transit]]'' (for example, in the sentence "''riding'' the ''subway downtown''"); such American introductions as ''commuter'' (from ''commutation ticket), [[concourse]], to board'' (a vehicle), ''to park, double-park'' and ''parallel park'' (a car), ''[[Wikt:double decker|double decker]]'' or the noun ''terminal'' have long been used in all dialects of English.<ref>A few of these are now chiefly found, or have been more productive, outside of the U.S.; for example, ''jump,'' "to drive past a traffic signal;" ''block'' meaning "building," and ''center,'' "central point in a town" or "main area for a particular activity" (cf. Oxford English Dictionary).</ref>

Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations ''([[bartender]], longshoreman, patrolman, [[hobo]], [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], bellhop, [[roustabout]], [[White-collar worker|white collar]], [[blue collar]], [[employee]], boss'' [from Dutch], ''[[intern]], [[busboy]], [[mortician]], [[senior citizen]]),'' businesses and workplaces ''([[department store]], [[supermarket]], [[thrift store]], [[gift shop]], [[Pharmacy|drugstore]], [[motel]], [[main street]], [[gas station]], [[hardware store]], [[Savings and loan association|savings and loan]], hock'' [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations ''([[automated teller machine]], [[smart card]], [[cash register]], [[dishwasher]], reservation'' [as at hotels], ''pay envelope, [[movie]], mileage, [[shortage]], [[power outage|outage]], [[blood bank]]).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Already existing English words—such as ''[[General store|store]], [[Retailing|shop]], dry goods, [[haberdashery]], [[lumber]]''—underwent shifts in meaning; some—such as ''[[wiktionary:Mason|mason]], student, [[clerk (position)|clerk]]'', the verbs ''can'' (as in "canned goods"), ''ship, fix, carry, enroll'' (as in school), ''run'' (as in "run a business"), ''release'' and ''haul''—were given new significations, while others (such as ''[[tradesman]])'' have retained meanings that disappeared in England. From the world of business and finance came ''[[breakeven]], [[merger]], [[Wikt:delisting|delisting]], [[downsize]], [[disintermediation]], [[Net income|bottom line]];'' from sports terminology came, jargon aside, ''Monday-morning quarterback, cheap shot, game plan'' ([[American football|football]]); ''in the [[ballpark]], out of [[left field]], off base, hit and run,'' and [[English language idioms derived from baseball|many other idioms]] from [[baseball]]; gamblers coined ''[[bluff (poker)|bluff]], [[Wikt:blue chip|blue chip]], [[Betting (poker)#Ante|ante]], bottom dollar, raw deal, pass the buck, ace in the hole, freeze-out, showdown;'' miners coined ''[[bedrock]], bonanza, peter out, pan out'' and the verb ''prospect'' from the noun; and railroadmen are to be credited with ''make the [[grade (slope)|grade]], sidetrack, head-on,'' and the verb ''railroad.'' A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: ''[[elevator]], [[ground (electricity)|ground]], [[gasoline]];'' many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not ''([[hatchback]], [[sport utility vehicle]], [[station wagon]], [[trunk (automobile)#Tailgate|tailgate]], [[motorhome]], [[truck]], [[pickup truck]], to exhaust).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] ''([[chutzpah]], schmooze, tush'') and [[German language|German]]—''[[hamburger]]'' and culinary terms like ''frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, [[Hot dog|wiener]], [[delicatessen|deli(catessen)]]; [[scram]], [[kindergarten]], [[Responses to sneezing|gesundheit]];''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19970923 |title=The Maven's Word of the Day: gesundheit |publisher=[[Random House]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> musical terminology ''([[whole note]], [[half note]],'' etc.); and apparently ''[[cookbook]], fresh'' ("impudent") and ''what gives?'' Such constructions as ''Are you coming with?'' and ''I like to dance'' (for "I like dancing") may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence.<ref>[[Peter Trudgill|Trudgill, Peter]] (2004). ''New-Dialect Formation: The Inevitability of Colonial Englishes''.</ref>

Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from ''[[Okay|OK]]'' and ''cool'' to ''[[nerd]]'' and ''[[24/7]]),'' while others have not ''([[have a nice day]], for sure);''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&which_entry=009421%23x1%23x1%23day&selected_word=day&search_word=day |title=Definition of day noun from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Oup.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&which_entry=036903%23x1%23x1%23sure&selected_word=sure&search_word=sure#sure_adv |title=Definition of sure adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary|publisher=Oup.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> many are now distinctly old-fashioned ''(swell, groovy).'' Some English words now in general use, such as ''hijacking, [[disc jockey]], boost, bulldoze'' and ''[[jazz]],'' originated as American slang. Among the many English idioms of U.S. origin are ''get the hang of, bark up the wrong tree, keep tabs, run scared, take a backseat, have an edge over, stake a claim, take a shine to, in on the ground floor, bite off more than one can chew, off/on the wagon, stay put, inside track, [[stiff upper lip]], bad hair day, [[monkeywrenching|throw a monkey wrench/monkeywrenching]], under the weather, jump bail, come clean, come again?, it ain't over till it's over,'' and ''what goes around comes around.''{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Morphology===
American English has always shown a marked tendency [[functional shift|to use nouns as verbs]].<ref name = "iqiyyl">Trudgill, p. 69.</ref> Examples of verbed nouns are ''interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, service'' (as a car), ''corner, torch, exit'' (as in "exit the lobby"), ''factor'' (in mathematics), ''gun'' ("shoot"), ''author'' (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, ''proposition, graft'' (bribery), ''bad-mouth, [[vacation]], major, [[backpack]], [[backtracking|backtrack]], intern, ticket'' (traffic violations), ''hassle, [[asphalt concrete|blacktop]], peer-review, dope'' and ''[[Drug overdose|OD]]'', and, of course ''verbed'' as used at the start of this sentence.

[[Compound (linguistics)|Compound]]s coined in the U.S. are for instance ''[[foothill]], [[flatlands]], [[badlands]], [[landslide]]'' (in all senses), ''[[:wikt:overview|overview]]'' (the noun), ''[[Wikt:backdrop|backdrop]], [[teenager]], [[brainstorming|brainstorm]], [[Wikt:bandwagon|bandwagon]], [[hitchhike]], smalltime, [[Wikt:deadbeat|deadbeat]], [[frontman]], lowbrow'' and ''highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face'' (later verbed), ''upfront'' (in all senses), ''fixer-upper, no-show;'' many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: ''[[non-profit]], [[for-profit]], free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and-out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck;'' many compound nouns and adjectives are open: ''[[happy hour]], [[fall guy]], [[capital gain]], [[road trip]], wheat pit, head start, [[plea bargain]];'' some of these are colorful ''([[empty nester]], [[loan shark]], [[Wikt:ambulance chaser|ambulance chaser]], [[buzz saw]], [[ghetto blaster]], dust bunny),'' others are euphemistic ''([[differently abled]] (physically challenged), [[human resources]],  [[affirmative action]], [[correctional facility]]).''

Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: ''[[Wikt:add-on|add-on]], stopover, lineup, [[Wikt:shakedown|shakedown]], tryout, spin-off, [[rundown]]'' ("summary"), ''[[shootout]], [[holdup]], hideout, comeback, cookout, [[Bribery|kickback]], [[makeover]], [[takeover]], rollback'' ("decrease"), ''rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up'' ("stoppage"), ''stand-in.'' These essentially are nouned [[phrasal verb]]s; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin ''(spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in'' and ''check out'' (in all senses), ''fill in'' ("inform"), ''kick in'' or ''throw in'' ("contribute"), ''square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off'' (from employment), ''run into'' and ''across'' ("meet"), ''stop by, pass up, put up'' (money), ''set up'' ("frame"), ''trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out).''{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}<ref>British author [[George Orwell]] (in ''English People'', 1947, cited in OED s.v. ''lose)'' criticized an alleged "American tendency" to "burden every verb with a preposition that adds nothing to its meaning (''win out'', ''lose out'', ''face up to'', etc.)".</ref>

Noun endings such as ''-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)'' and ''-cian (beautician)'' are also particularly productive.<ref name = "iqiyyl"/> Some verbs ending in ''-ize'' are of U.S. origin; for example, ''fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, [[weatherization|weatherize]], winterize, [[Miranda v. Arizona|Mirandize]];'' and so are some [[back-formation]]s ''(locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve'' and ''enthuse).'' Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are ''as of'' (with dates and times), ''outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to, not about to'' and ''lack for.''

Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably ''pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry'' (as in "pry open", from ''prize), putter'' (verb), ''buddy, [[sundae]], skeeter, sashay'' and ''kitty-corner.'' Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, ''lengthy, bossy, [[cuteness|cute]]'' and ''cutesy, grounded'' (of a child), ''punk'' (in all senses), ''sticky'' (of the weather), ''through'' (as in "through train", or meaning "finished"), and many colloquial forms such as ''peppy'' or ''wacky''. American [[Blend word|blend]]s include ''[[motel]], guesstimate, [[infomercial]]'' and ''[[televangelist]].''

===English words that survived in the United States and not in the United Kingdom===
A number of words and meanings that originated in [[Middle English]] or [[Early Modern English]] and that have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scots]]. Terms such as ''[[autumn|fall]]'' ("autumn"), ''[[faucet]]'' ("tap"), ''[[diaper]]'' ("nappy"), ''[[candy]]'' ("sweets"), ''[[Frying pan|skillet]]'', ''[[eyeglasses]]'' and ''[[obligate]]'' are often regarded as Americanisms. ''Fall'' for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like "fall of the leaf" and "fall of the year".<ref>{{OEtymD|fall}}</ref>

During the 17th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|English immigration to the British colonies]] in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term ''fall'' gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America. ''Gotten'' ([[past participle]] of ''get'') is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of [[UK|Britain]], such as [[Lancashire]] and [[North East England]], that still continue to use it and sometimes also use ''putten'' as the past participle for ''put'' (which is not done by most speakers of American English).<ref>''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann & Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 115.</ref>

Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include ''hire'' ("to employ"), ''quit'' ("to stop", which spawned ''quitter'' in the U.S.), ''I guess'' (famously criticized by [[H. W. Fowler]]), ''[[baggage]]'', ''hit'' (a place), and the adverbs ''overly'' and ''presently'' ("currently"). Some of these, for example ''[[monkey wrench]]'' and ''[[wastebasket]]'', originated in 19th century Britain.

The mandative [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (as in "the City Attorney suggested that the case ''not be closed''") is livelier in American English than it is in British English. It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal. The adjectives ''mad'' meaning "angry", ''smart'' meaning "intelligent", and ''sick'' meaning "ill" are also more frequent in American (these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno-English) than British English.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_angry.gif |title=angry |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_intelligent.gif |title=intelligent |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/ill |title=Definition of ill adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher=Oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>

===Regionally distinct terms within the United States===
Linguist [[Bert Vaux]] created a survey, completed in 2003, polling English speakers across the United States about the specific words they would use in everyday speech for various concepts.<ref>Vaux, Bert and Scott Golder. 2003. [http://dialect.redlog.net/ The Harvard Dialect Survey]. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Linguistics Department.</ref> This 2003 study concluded that:
*For a "long sandwich that contains [[cold cut]]s, lettuce, and so on", the most common term found in the survey, throughout the country (preferred by 77% of the participants), was the word ''sub'' (an abbreviation for ''[[submarine sandwich]]''). The [[New York metropolitan area]] shows the greatest variety of terms for this idea in one single region, largely counting for the 5% of the survey who preferred the term ''hero'', nearly 7% (which is even more prevalent in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, including all of New Jersey as well as eastern Pennsylvania) who preferred ''hoagie'', and just less that 3% (also notably prevalent throughout New England, except Maine) who prefer ''grinder''. 
*The U.S. is largely divided about the "generic term for a sweetened carbonated beverage". Nearly 53% of the surveyed sample preferred ''soda'', particularly in the Northeast, [[Eastern Ridges and Lowlands|eastern Wisconsin]], [[Greater St. Louis]], the far [[Western United States|West]], and some of [[South Florida]]. Over 25% preferred ''pop'', particularly around the [[the Midwest|Midwest]] (including the [[Great Lakes region]]) and the Western regions along the Canadian border. Over 12% preferred ''coke'' (which is also trademarked for a [[Coca-Cola|specific cola product]]), particularly scattered throughout the [[Southern United States|South]]. Urban, coastal California speakers use all three terms, though especially ''soda''. Speakers of the [[Western United States|West]] generally use ''soda'' or ''pop''.<ref>Katz, Joshua (2013). "[http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jakatz2/files/dialectposter.png Beyond 'Soda, Pop, or Coke].' North Carolina State University.</ref>
*The most common word or phrase "to address a group of two or more people" (in the second [[Grammatical person|person]]) was ''you guys'' at almost 43%, particularly throughout the Northeast and Great Lakes region (along with simply ''you'' at nearly 13%). ''Y'all'' was preferred by 14%, particularly in the South, but reaching somewhat noticeably into the Northern regions as well. ''Yous(e)'' was largely confined to the New York and Philadelphia metropolitan areas, at just over 0.5%.
*The most common term for generic, rubber-soled shoes worn for athletic activities is ''sneakers'' as said by 46% of those surveyed throughout the country, but particularly in the Northeast. 41%, particularly outside of the Northeast, said ''tennis shoes''. Several much rarer other terms were also documented in various regions of the country.
*Nearly 68% of the participating speakers make no distinction between ''[[dinner]]'' and ''[[supper]]'', or simply never use the term ''supper''.
*64% of the participants said they use "Where are you at?" to mean "How are you coming along?" This also incorporated the 34% who use "Where are you at?" in any context, for example, to even mean "Where are you physically located right now?"
*Freshwater "[[crayfish|miniature lobsters]]" were identified by 40% of polled speakers as ''crawfish'', 32% as ''crayfish'', and 19% as ''crawdads'' within no particular regional boundaries, except that ''crayfish'' was especially uncommon in the South. 5% reported having no term for this animal.
*The most common nicknames for grandparents were ''grandpa''/''grampa'' and ''grandma''/''gramma''.
*Nearly all American English speakers called the [[lampyridae|lampyrid insect]] a ''firefly'' or ''lightning bug'', with nearly 40% using the two terms interchangeably.
*The use of the word [[positive anymore|''anymore'' with a positive sense]], simply as a synonym for ''nowadays'' (e.g. ''I do only figurative paintings anymore''), was reported as sounding acceptable to 5% of participants. However, in example sentences with a clearly disheartened tone or dismissive attitude, the positive use of ''anymore'' sounded acceptable to as many as 29% of participants (e.g. ''Forget your baby wearing nice clothes anymore''). This rare use of the word was observed much more around Pennsylvania and going westward into the [[Midland American English|Midland region]].
*The [[shopping cart|"wheeled contraption" for carrying groceries]] was identified by 77% of participants as a ''shopping cart'' and by nearly 14% as a ''grocery cart''. 4% preferred the term ''buggy'': a clearly Southern phenomenon.

==Differences between British and American English==
{{Main|Comparison of American and British English}}
American English and [[British English]] (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.
The first large American dictionary, ''An American Dictionary of the English Language'', known as [[Webster's Dictionary]], was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.

Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some [[auxiliary verb]]s; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived'') although the purportedly "British" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''<!--when it means "to be a student"-->); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other,<ref>Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-37993-8.</ref> and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.

Differences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''license'' for ''licence'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, "he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology".<ref>Algeo, John. "The Effects of the Revolution on Language", in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley & Sons, 2008. p.599</ref> Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of the 19th century [[Victorian era]] England (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).<ref>Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-62181-X, pp. 34 and 511.</ref> AmE almost always uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' (see [[Oxford spelling]]).

There are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called "comma splices" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.<ref name="APA">{{cite web

 |accessdate=2015-03-21}}</ref>

AmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.

British English also differ from American English in that some British words are pronounced with silent letters than are normally heard in AmE, such as the silent "c" in "schedule."
