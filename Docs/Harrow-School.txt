==History==
Various schools{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} in the same location have educated boys since 1243, but the School in its current form was founded in February 1572 under a Royal Charter granted by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] to [[John Lyon (school founder)|John Lyon]], a local wealthy farmer.<ref name=BritishHistory>{{cite web|title=Harrow school|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22134|accessdate=19 December 2007 |publisher=British History Online}}</ref> In the School's original charter, six governors were named, including two members of the Gerard family of Flambards, and two members of the Page family of Wembley and Sudbury Court.<ref>{{cite book|title=Harrow School|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwYCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22harrow+school%22+%22page+family%22&source=bl&ots=_h3DwS7Oqj&sig=7ZGW5xAHTTxcyiW4Yr91SrQ2w7U&hl=en&ei=iTcaS5ezGYeqtgOJsdH-BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22harrow%20school%22%20%22page%20family%22&f=false|accessdate=5 December 2009|publisher=Edward Arnold, London}}</ref> It was only after the death of Lyon's wife in 1608 that the construction of the first school building began. It was completed in 1615 and remains to this day, however it is now much larger.

The School grew gradually at first, but growth became rapid during Imperial times as British prosperity grew. Lyon died in 1592, leaving his assets to two causes, the lesser being the School, and by far the greater beneficiary being the maintenance of a road to London, 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) away. The school owned and maintained this road for many years following Lyon's death, and the whole school still runs along this 10-mile road in an event called "Long Ducker" every November. At first the primary subject taught was [[Latin]], and the only sport was [[archery]]. Both subjects were compulsory; archery was dropped in 1771.<ref>[http://swansea.academia.edu/MartinJohnes/Papers/127610/Archery--Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales--c--1780-1840 Archery—Romance-and-Elite-Culture-in-England-and-Wales—c--1780-1840 Martin Johnes. Archery, Romance and Elite Culture in England and Wales, c. 1780–1840 ]</ref> Although most boys were taught for free, their tuition paid for by Lyon's endowment, there were a number of fee-paying "foreigners" (boys from outside the parish). It was their presence that amplified the need for boarding facilities. By 1701 for every local there were two "foreign" pupils; this was used to generate funds for the School as fees increased. By 1876 the ratio was so high that [[The John Lyon School|John Lyon Lower School]] was brought under the authority of the governors of the Upper School so that the School complied with its object of providing education for the boys of the parish. It is now known as The John Lyon School and is a prominent independent school in England. It maintains close links with Harrow.<ref name=BritishHistory/> The majority of the school's boarding houses were constructed in Victorian times, when the number of boys increased dramatically.<ref>{{cite book|title=A history of Harrow School|last=Tyerman|first=Christopher|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-822796-5}}</ref> [[File:The Old Schools, Harrow School.JPG|thumb|left|Old Schools]]

The 20th century saw the innovation of a central dining hall, the demolition of small houses and further modernisation of the curriculum. Presently there are about 800 boys boarding at Harrow.<ref name=ISIReport/>

In 2005, the School was one of fifty of the country's leading independent schools which were found guilty of running an [[Independent school fee fixing scandal|illegal price-fixing cartel]], exposed by ''[[The Times]]'', which had allowed them to drive up fees for thousands of parents, although the schools said that they had not realised that the change to the law (which had happened only a few months earlier) about the sharing of information had subsequently made it an offence.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/education/article588559.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Independent schools face huge fines over cartel to fix fees | first=Tony | last=Halpin | date=10 November 2005 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref> Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling £3,000,000 into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.<ref>{{citenews|title=OFT names further trustees as part of the independent schools settlement|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402142426/http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/182-06|publisher=[[Office of Fair Trading]] (archived on nationalarchives.org.uk)|date=21 December 2006}}</ref> However, Mrs Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the [[Office of Fair Trading|OFT]] director-general, saying, "They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1455730/Private-schools-send-papers-to-fee-fixing-inquiry.html | title = Private schools send papers to fee-fixing inquiry | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | location = London | date =3 January 2004 | accessdate = 15 March 2010}}</ref>

According to a 2009 article, the School Governors have expanded overseas, opening additional schools in [[Beijing]], [[China]] ([[Harrow International School Beijing]]); [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]] ([[Harrow International School, Bangkok]]); and [[New Territories]], Hong Kong ([[Harrow International School Hong Kong]]).<ref name=HarrowInternational>{{cite web|title=Harrow International School, (Beijing)|url=http://www.harrowbeijing.cn/| accessdate=9 October 2009| publisher= Harrow Beijing}}</ref>

==School traditions==

===Uniform===
Boys at Harrow have two uniforms.

Everyday dress, worn to most lessons, consists of a white shirt, black silk tie, light grey trousers, black shoes, an optional blue jumper ([[sweater]]), a dark blue woollen uniform jacket known as a "bluer", the option of the School blue and white scarf and dark blue woollen overcoat similar to the bluer on cold days and, notably, the Harrow Hat, often erroneously called a [[boater]], made of varnished straw with a dark blue band. Variations include boys who are [[prefect|monitors]] who are allowed to wear a jumper of their choice, and members of certain societies who may earn the right to replace the standard school tie with one of a variety of scarves, [[cravats]], neck and bow ties.<ref name=Terminology>{{cite web|title=Harrow Terminology |url=http://www.harrowschool.org.uk/default.aspx?id=8|accessdate = 9 October 2009|work= Tradition |publisher=Harrow School}}</ref>

An alternative uniform, Sunday dress, worn every Sunday and for more formal engagements, consists of something similar to [[morning dress]]; a black [[tailcoat]], which is cut similarly to an evening coat, but with a distinctly higher-cut skirt and no facing on the lapels, dark grey pinstriped trousers, a black waistcoat, a black tie, braces and a white shirt. Variations include a grey waistcoat for those who contribute greatly to School sport, maroon waistcoats for members of "The Guild", which is the school's arts society, a black [[top hat]] and cane for monitors, and a hat with black speckles for boys in the 1st XI Cricket.

The Head of School has the distinction of wearing full [[white tie]] during the ''Contio Latina'', a speech delivered annually by the Head Boy entirely in Latin.

Another notable feature of the uniform at Harrow is that there is a separate set of sports uniform of the House colours. These include football shirts, socks, and a rugby shirt. This distinguishes members of different Houses.

The Harrow uniform achieved notoriety in the mid 20th century when [[Toffs and Toughs|a 1937 photograph of two Harrovians in Sunday Dress being watched by three working class boys]] was taken outside Lord's Cricket Ground. The photograph was placed on the front cover of the [[News Chronicle]] (now absorbed into the [[Daily Mail]]) the next morning under the tagline "Every picture tells a story". The picture was soon reproduced in other national publications and became, and remains, one of the most popular symbols of the class divide in the United Kingdom.<ref name="guardianclass">{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/mar/23/ian-jack-photograph | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The photograph that defined the class divide | first=Ian | last=Jack | date=23 March 2010 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

===Practices===

Every new boy who enters the School is given a two-week period of time called "grace" when he is not fully subject to all School rules and is shown the ropes by an assigned boy in the year above called a "Shepherd". Soon after this period of time ends the boy sits the "new boys' test" which tests general knowledge of the School's traditions. Some time later all new boys also sing a solo in front of their House at a House Songs, officially ending their time as a new boy.

All boys are required to wear their hats when going to or from lessons and to "cap" all teachers (also known as "beaks") who pass them on any public road and chapel terrace, which is done by the boy raising his forefinger to the brim of his hat. Those who do not follow these rules are punished.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Songs===
Songs have been a part of Harrow life since John Farmer, a former head of music, wrote the first song in 1864.  The School considers them to be a unifying force as they are sung by the boys in their Houses every term. Songs are sung by the whole School to audiences of parents, former pupils of the School, and guests of honour that have, in the past, included members of the royal family and representatives from previous governments. The song ''[[Forty Years On (song)|Forty Years On]]'' has become known as the School Song, although in reality it is one of many compositions.<ref name="Song">{{cite web|title=The school Song|url=http://www.harrowschool.org.uk/default.aspx?id=9|accessdate=9 October 2009|work=Tradition |publisher=Harrow School}}</ref> It features a verse about [[Winston Churchill]], and was heard in the film ''[[Young Winston]].''

===Sport===
Harrow has been instrumental in the development of a number of sports.

The sport [[squash (sport)|squash]] (originally called 'Squasher') was invented in Harrow out of the older game [[rackets (sport)|rackets]] around 1830<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.squashplayer.co.uk/history_of_squash.htm|accessdate=5 June 2010 |publisher=squashplayer.co.uk |title=History of squash}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldsquash.org.uk/history1.html|accessdate=5 June 2010 |publisher=worldsquash.org.uk |title= History}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.talksquash.co.uk/guides/history_of_squash.html|accessdate=5 June 2010 |publisher=talksquash.co.uk |title= History of squash}}</ref> before the game spread to other schools, eventually becoming an international sport.

In the [[history of association football|development of Association Football]], Harrow was one of seven schools that met to develop the 1863 [[Cambridge Rules]], which would influence [[The Football Association]]'s first set of rules, the 1863 [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the game]].

An annual [[cricket]] match has taken place between Harrow and [[Eton College]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] since 1805. It is considered to be the longest-running cricket fixture in the world<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/211281.html|accessdate=5 June 2010 |publisher=cricinfo.com |title=The oldest fixture of them all }}</ref> and is the oldest fixture at Lord's (see: [[Eton v Harrow]]). Eton won the match in 2013, and Harrow in 2014.

Harrow has its own unique style of football called [[Harrow Football]]. The object of the game is to score a "base", which is achieved by kicking the ball between a pair of vertical posts, located at each end of the ground, similar to rugby posts but without a cross-bar. This may be done either from open play or from 'yards'{{clarify|date=January 2014}} and the kick may be of any height. An important feature is the offside rule whereby a player must be behind the ball before he can play it. Handling is allowed from a kick on the volley: the ball may be caught and a call of "yards" allows the catcher a space of three running yards unmolested and a free kick out of the hands.<ref name=football>{{cite web|title=Harrow Football: The Game|url=http://www.harrowschool.org.uk/default.aspx?id=7|accessdate=9 October 2009 |work= Tradition |publisher=Harrow School}}</ref>

===The Harrovian===
[[The Harrovian]] is the School newspaper that is published weekly during term time. Its articles are written anonymously and the School stresses that the opinions expressed in the newspaper do not reflect School policy. The newspaper is published as both an organ of record and a forum for comment, debate and the expression of individual opinions in the School. The Harrovian is also published online by the Harrow Association. The Headmaster, however reserves the right to remove any article from the Harrovian prior to publication if he sees fit.<ref name=Harrovian>{{cite web|title=The Harrovian online|url=http://www.harrowschool.org.uk/default.aspx?id=318|accessdate=9 October 2009|publisher= Harrow School}}</ref>

During their second and third years ('Removes' and Fifth Form), boys work towards their [[GCSE]] examinations. They continue with English, Mathematics, the three sciences, and at least one modern language. In addition to these core subjects pupils choose four other subjects from Geography, Astronomy, History, Religious Studies, Classical Civilisation, Classical Greek, Chinese, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Art, Design Technology, Music, Drama, and Physical Education.<ref name=Academic/>

In the Sixth Forms all pupils are expected to take [[GCE Advanced Level|AS-level]] in at least four main subjects, going on to [[A-level]] in at least three. There are many to choose from including English Literature, French, German, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Greek, History, Geography, Economics, [[Business Studies]], [[Ancient History]], Classical Civilisation, Government and Politics, Religious Studies, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Design Technology, Physical Education, Music, Music Technology, Art, History of Art, Theatre Studies, Statistics and Photography.<ref name=Academic/>

==Examinations and universities==

22 Harrovians secured Oxbridge offers on 21 January 2014 and four successful applicants were Old Harrovians who applied during their gap year. Previously in 2013, 13 boys gained places at Oxford, 9 at Cambridge.

At GCSE in 2013, 64.0% of grades were at A*, and 89.7% were at A* or A. At A-Level, 25.8% of grades were at A*, and 71.0% at A* or A.<ref>[http://www.harrowschool.org.uk/1808/academic-life/a-level-exam-results-2013/]</ref>

==School grounds==
[[File:Harrowtennis.jpg|thumb|left|Harrow School has 24 tennis courts which include [[acrylic resin|acrylic]], [[Tarmac|hard]] and synthetic [[Grass|lawn]] which belong to Harrow Lawn Tennis Club (HLTC)]]
Harrow School is not built on a campus: it is fully integrated into the surrounding area; there are private houses, shops, businesses and bars/restaurants on Harrow Hill, and the main road through Harrow Hill is a normal public highway and indeed a bus route. Harrow School is made up of some {{convert|400|acre|ha}} of playing fields, tennis courts, golf course, woodland and gardens.

Harrow School also owns its own working farm. Currently on the farm are a herd of [[English Longhorn|Longhorn]] cattle and a flock of Shetland sheep. Until 2003 it was a working dairy farm.

Harrow School divides its pupils, who are all [[Boarding school|boarders]], into twelve [[House system|Houses]], each of about seventy boys, with a thirteenth house, Gayton, used as an overflow. Each House has its own facilities, customs and traditions, and each competes in sporting events against the others.

Until the 1950s there existed what were known as 'small houses' where only 5–10 boys stayed at one time while they waited for a space in a ''large house'' to become available (hence the use of the term large house in this article). A twelfth large house, Lyon's, was built in 2010 and opened at the beginning of the 2010 Autumn term.<ref name=Houses/>

House Masters, Deputy House Masters and their families live in the boarding Houses and are assisted by House Tutors appointed from the teaching staff. Every House has a residential House Tutor, who may or may not also be the Deputy House Master. The House Master oversees the welfare of every boy in his care; for parents he is the main point of contact with the School.<ref name=Houses/>

Each House has a resident matron, and sick room. The matrons are supported by the School's Medical Centre where trained nursing staff offer round the clock care. The medical centre is under the direct supervision of the school doctor who is available on the Hill every day for consultation.<ref name=Houses/>

There are no dormitories: a boy shares his room for the first three to six terms and thereafter has a room to himself. It is very much his own place, his home for the term, where he keeps his belongings, puts up his pictures (within reason and decency), does his work and leads much of his social life. Each House has at least one year-group-specific common room with newspapers, television and video. All have their own gardens and sports facilities.<ref name=Houses/>

==Fees and charges==
As of 2014/15, Harrow School charges £36,150 (about €40,000 or US$54,000) per year for board and tuition.<ref>[http://www.harrowschool.org.uk/1572/admissions/fees-and-other-information/ Harrow School | Admissions | Fees & Charges |<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 
A few select students can obtain either means-tested bursaries for exceptionally able students of parents who may not be able to afford school fees. There are also  excellence-based scholarships to reduce this amount. Scholarships (30 per year, awarded before the admission to Harrow) can reduce fees by 5–10%, bursaries can reduce fees in some rare hardship cases by up to 95%.<ref>[http://www.harrowschool.org.uk/default.aspx?id=91 Scholarships and bursaries], Harrow School, 2009</ref> Charging up to £11,530 per term in 2014/15, Harrow is the fifth most expensive HMC boarding school in the UK.<ref>http://www.privateschoolfees.co.uk</ref>

The Peter Beckwith Harrow Scholarship, which includes a means-tested bursary which may pay for up to the entirety of the school's fees in some, but by no means all, cases for the duration of the pupil's time at Harrow School, was featured in a [[Channel 4]] documentary. However, this documentary implied that the scholarship pays for all the fees in all cases.

==Media coverage==
{{main|Harrow: A Very British School}}
Harrow was featured in a [[Sky 1]] documentary series entitled "Harrow: A very British School" in 2013.
<br />
In February 2016, the actor [[Laurence Fox]] claimed Harrow threatened legal action to prevent him discussing the racism, homophobia and bullying he allegedly encountered at the school.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/12170237/Laurence-Fox-Harrow-tried-to-silence-me-over-racism-homophobia-and-bullying.html|title=Laurence Fox: Harrow tried to silence me over racism, homophobia and bullying|work=Daily Telegraph|author= Leon Watson|date=23 February 2016|accessdate=23 February 2016}}</ref>

==Old Speech Room Gallery & Museum==

The '''Old Speech Room Gallery & Museum''' is located in the Old Speech Room, which was built in 1819–1821 as a room to encourage public speaking.<ref>[http://www.harrowschool.org.uk/default.aspx?id=97 Old Speech Room Gallery & Museum]</ref> The gallery was opened in 1976 to house the School's collections, which include [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] antiquities, English watercolours, Modern British paintings, books and natural history artefacts. There is a set of [[gilding|gilt]] [[Easter eggs]] created by contemporary gold and silversmith [[Stuart Devlin]], which have been designed in the tradition of [[Fabergé egg]]s and include surprise interiors. There are also some sculptures, including portrait busts of such Old Harrovians as [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] and [[Lord Byron]].

The paintings include [[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]]'s ''A Distant View of Venice'', 1929.  Other artists include [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]], David Jones, [[Victor Pasmore]] and [[Richard Shirley Smith]].

The Museum hosts themed exhibits from its collections.  Admission is free.
