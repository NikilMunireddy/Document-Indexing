'''Huntington''' is a city in [[Cabell County, West Virginia|Cabell]] and [[Wayne County, West Virginia|Wayne]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] 
of [[West Virginia]], located at the confluence of the [[Guyandotte River]] and the [[Ohio River]]. The City of Huntington was founded as the western terminus of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] in 1871 upon agricultural homesteads, and is eponymously named for the railroad's founder [[Collis Potter Huntington]]. The first identifiable permanent settlement, Holderby's Landing, was founded in 1775 in what was then the [[Colony of Virginia]], but the area had been sparsely settled by French as early as 1609.  Most of the city is in Cabell County, for which it is the [[county seat]].<ref name="GR6" />

==Geography==
Huntington is in the southwestern corner of [[West Virginia]], on the border with [[Ohio]],  on the southern bank of the [[Ohio River]], at the [[confluence]] with the [[Guyandotte River]]. The city lies within the [[ecoregion]] of the [[Western Allegheny Plateau (ecoregion)|Western Allegheny Plateau]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/cropmap/wvirginia/maps/WVeco3.html |title=Level III Ecoregions of West Virginia |work=Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}</ref> Most of the city is in Cabell County, for which it is the [[county seat]].<ref name="GR6" /> A portion of the city, mainly the neighborhood of Westmoreland, is in [[Wayne County, West Virginia|Wayne County]]. Huntington is commonly divided into four main sections. The north/south divider is the [[CSX]] railroad tracks, while the east/west divider is First Street. Residents of Huntington are called "Huntingtonians."

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|18.46|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|16.22|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|2.24|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name ="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref>  The [[Guyandotte River]] joins the [[Ohio River]] about {{convert|5|mi|sp=us}} east of downtown. Huntington fills the roughly three-mile wide [[flood plain]] of the south bank of the Ohio River for eighty [[city block|square blocks]] and portions of the hills to the immediate south and southeast.

==Location and nomenclature==
[[File:Huntington Metro.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Map of the [[Huntington-Ashland-Ironton metropolitan area|
Greater Huntington Metro Area]].]]
Huntington was founded on lightly populated lands near Guyandotte as a [[C&O Railroad]] hub, on the southern bank of the [[Ohio River]], at the [[confluence]] with the [[Guyandotte River]].  The site is at the southwestern corner of [[West Virginia]] on the border with the state of [[Ohio]] and near the border of both states with [[Kentucky]]. Discounting the period of French ownership, the land that was part of Guyandotte and later Huntington was originally part of the 28,628-acre (115.85 km2) [[French and Indian War]] veteran's Savage Grant.

The area of greater Huntington, although situated in a [[Southern United States|Southern state]], was originally settled as early as 1609 and was long considered a [[American frontier|western city]] in what was then the [[Colony of Virginia]] since the first permanent settlements were founded in 1775<ref
 name="FYIabout">{{plain link|1=http://fyihuntington.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=130&Itemid=683|2=History of Huntington West Virginia}}FYI.com about Huntington, Published on Wednesday, August 3, 2011, accessdate=April 24, 2016</ref> in defiance of British injunctions against settlements west of the Alleghenies in the vicinity of Holderby's Landing.<ref name="FYIabout"/>

Historically, the old Federal Era town of [[Guyandotte, Huntington, West Virginia|Guyandotte]] (now a neighborhood absorbed into Huntington proper) was first built upon in 1609 by French setters of the Ohio Valley, and has homes dating back to 1820 and a graveyard containing 18th-century French and Colonial-era settlers, including surnames such as LeTulle, Holderby, and Buffington. A farmer James Holderby (1782&ndash;1855) purchased the lands in 1821 upon which much of Huntington now stands which is why the area was known as Holderby's Landing prior to 1870-71 when it was incorporated and renamed;<ref name="FYIabout"/> Holderby's estate included the lands gifted in 1837 to found what is now [[Marshall University]]. The C&O purchased the area in 1870, and by 1873 when the railroad connected Richmond to the Ohio, it had undergone a transition from a sleepy agricultural region with the nearby subscription Academy into a growing rail center poised to act as a spring board for a railroad to penetrate and connect the [[midwest]] with the eastern seaboard. The town of Guyandotte was officially absorbed in 1891.

Modern day Huntington is commonly divided into four main sections. The north/south divider is the CSX railroad tracks, while the east/west divider is First Street. Residents of Huntington are called "Huntingtonians." A portion of the city, mainly the neighborhood of Westmoreland, is in [[Wayne County, West Virginia|Wayne County]]. Most of the city is in Cabell County, of which it is the [[county seat]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=June 7, 2011|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref>  Huntington is influenced by [[Appalachia|Appalachian Culture]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern culture]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern culture]], and [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic culture]]. It is often referred to as one of the northernmost cities in the [[Southern United States|South]] or one of the southernmost cities in the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]].
 
The [[Huntington–Ashland, WV–KY–OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area|Huntington Metro Area]] is sometimes called '''KYOWVA''', an [[acronym]] that refers to the three states that make up the region, ([[Kentucky]], [[Ohio]], and [[West Virginia]]). As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the [[Huntington–Ashland, WV–KY–OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area|Huntington Metro Area]] is the largest in [[West Virginia]] with a population of 365,419. Huntington is combined with Charleston, the state capital, as the Huntington-Charleston TV market, the 64th-largest in the nation.<ref name="m.whitehouse.gov"/><ref name="2011 estimate">[http://www.census.gov/popest/data/metro/totals/2011/tables/CBSA-EST2011-01.csv 2011 estimate]</ref>

==History==
[[File:Collis Potter Huntington by William Keith, c1900.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Collis P. Huntington, founder of the City of Huntington.]]
The first permanent settlement in modern-day Huntington was founded in 1775 as "Holderby's Landing." The modern City of Huntington was founded by [[Collis P. Huntington]] and [[Delos W. Emmons]] as the western terminus for the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O) on a tract of land west of the mouth of the [[Guyandotte River]], between the [[Ohio River]] and [[Twelve Pole Creek]]. Collis P. Huntington was one of the "Big Four" of western railroading who built the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] as part of the first U.S. transcontinental railroad (along with [[Leland Stanford]], [[Mark Hopkins, Jr.|Mark Hopkins]], and [[Charles Crocker]]).

Huntington was created as a hub for the C&O, which, once completed in 1873, fulfilled a long-held dream of the Virginias to have a rail link from the [[James River]] at [[Richmond, Virginia]] to the [[Ohio River Valley]]. The new railroad facilities adjacent to the Ohio River resulted in expansion of the former small town of Guyandotte into part of a large new city called Huntington. The C&O Railroad expanded east to [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]] (and [[coal pier]]s), and west to eventually reach [[Cincinnati]] and Chicago in later years. After merging with several other railroads, C&O is now known as [[CSX Transportation]].

The city was [[Incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] in 1871 just west of the earlier city of [[Guyandotte, West Virginia|Guyandotte]]. Guyandotte, which became a neighborhood of Huntington in 1891, was founded in 1799 on land that was originally part of the {{convert|28628|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[French and Indian War]] veteran's Savage Grant.<ref name="City of Huntington">{{cite web|author=City of Huntington|title=Huntington History|url=http://www.cityofhuntington.com/pages/history.html}}</ref> Meriwether Lewis passed the Guyandotte and Big Sandy River peninsula on or about September 20, 1803, on his way down the Ohio River before meeting up with William Clark in Clarksville, Ind.

[[File:Huntington Trolley.jpg|thumb|right|Trolley bus No. 9 on Fourth Avenue]]
Huntington was the second American city to feature electric street cars in the early years (after [[San Francisco]]), until they were gradually replaced with gasoline-powered buses. Some of the old trolley tracks can still be seen. Camden Park, which at 110 years old is one of the world’s oldest amusement parks, was built in 1903 to encourage ridership on the trolleys (then owned by the Camden Interstate Railway Company).

Huntington’s "[[Boomtown|boom]]" period occurred from the founding in 1871 until the [[Ohio River Flood of 1937|Great Flood of 1937]], which claimed 5 lives, caused millions of dollars in damage, left tens of thousands homeless, and led to the creation of Huntington’s floodwalls in 1938.
Of the 40,000 people living in the flooded areas of Huntington, 25,000 were made refugees as fresh water and fuel was scarce. 11,000 people applied for Red Cross aid during the flood and the relief period.

[[File:Looking west on Fourth Avenue during the 1937 Flood.jpg|thumb|left|Fourth Avenue during the Great Flood of 1937.]]
[[World War II]] brought another economic boom, but that was short-lived and ended along with the war in the 1940s. Huntington’s population began to drop after 1950 because of [[urban sprawl]] and the [[rust belt|decline of the steel and manufacturing industries]]. In the 1970s, federal [[urban renewal]] programs destroyed several parts of downtown. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s the steel and manufacturing industry in the region imploded, with massive layoffs and mill and plant closures.

Beginning in the late 1980s, the city shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine and biotechnology. Although Huntington successfully shifted the focus of its economy and remains a viable city, the population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 86,353 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence caused a sharp decrease in population to just 51,475 in 2000.

===21st century===
[[File:Pullman Square Flowers and Fountain.jpg|thumb|right|Pullman Square]]
Huntington has seen a major revival since the opening of the [[Pullman Square]] Town Center on the vacant lot formerly known as the "Superblock" in 2005, the filming of the [[Warner Bros.]] motion picture [[We Are Marshall]] in 2006, and the filming of ABC’s [[Jamie Oliver's Food Revolution|Food Revolution]] in 2010. During the [[late 2000s recession]], Huntington remained economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them, and becoming one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. As of the most recent census in 2010, the population is on the rise for the first time in 6 decades. The modern [[Huntington-Ashland-Ironton metropolitan area|Huntington Metro Area]] spans 7 counties across 3 states and is the largest in [[West Virginia]] with a population of more than 360,000. The largest employers are [[Marshall University]], [[Cabell Huntington Hospital]], [[St. Mary's Medical Center (Huntington)|St. Mary’s Medical Center]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DirecTV]], and the City of Huntington.<ref name="Huntington in Bloom" />

Shortly after Pullman Square was constructed, the city began work on upgrading the streetscape on Fourth Avenue and Ninth Street. Ninth Street was formerly known as the Ninth Street Plaza and was closed to vehicle traffic for years, which effectively killed most businesses there. Once anchored by Pullman Square on the north end, the old plaza was removed in 2006 and Ninth Street has once again become attractive to businesses. Fourth Avenue, known as the "Old Main Corridor," continues to be upgraded yearly with new lighting, artistic and pedestrian-friendly design concepts, and bicycle lanes.

[[File:BigSandySuperstoreArena.JPG|thumb|left|The Big Sandy Superstore Arena.]]
Efforts to redevelop Huntington started with the construction of the $10.5 million [[Big Sandy Superstore Arena|Huntington Civic Arena]], which was the largest arena in the state when it opened in 1977. The 25-year delay in construction of what became Pullman Square caused the building to become a money losing effort for the city and is now managed privately by [[SMG (property management)|SMG]]. After renovation in 1997, and 2010, the arena has now been included in [[Billboard Magazine]]'s "New or Renovated Venues to Watch" list for 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/briefs/x455064691/Huntington-arena-named-a-venue-to-watch|title=Huntington arena named a 'venue to watch'|work=The Herald-Dispatch|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> Huntington's arena landed at No. 14 in a list of 17 venues across the globe.

The [[Huntington Mall]], the largest mall in the state, opened a few years after the Arena in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/news/communities/x1620952801 |title=Sense of community keeps Barboursville growing |accessdate=March 13, 2008 |date=October 24, 2007 |work=The Herald-Dispatch}}</ref> When the mall was built, the only other businesses around it were two bars and an [[Exxon]] gas station. Since the mall's opening, several retailers have built around the mall, including four hotels and several restaurants, as well as a [[Walmart]] Supercenter, the first [[Best Buy]] in West Virginia, and the first [[Sheetz]] gas station/convenience store in southern West Virginia.<ref name="affected">{{cite web|url=http://www.herald-dispatch.com/specialsections/100years/x613396146/TOP-STORY-Huntington-Mall-has-affected-entire-region|title=Huntington Mall has affected entire region|last=Rosenberger|first=Bill|date=January 15, 2009|work=The Herald-Dispatch|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}</ref> The Huntington Mall has a yearly economic impact of close to $400 million.

[[File:HeritageStation.jpg|thumb|right|The Huntington Welcome Center and the Shops at Heritage Station, as seen from across Veterans Memorial Blvd.]]
The Shops at Heritage Station are in the old [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Depot (Huntington, West Virginia)|Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Depot]], originally constructed in 1887. The complex includes an original steam engine with a “Pullman” train car, and a building that used to house one of Huntington’s first banks—which was the easternmost bank robbed by the [[James-Younger Gang]]. That structure is currently occupied by a specialty beer and cheese shop. Heritage Station was turned into a shopping center called “Heritage Village” during the dark days of Urban Renewal in the 1970s. For decades, the beautiful station sat hidden and virtually unused just two blocks from the city center, until Create Huntington got involved in 2006. Happily, today Heritage Station is a busy artisan retail complex, full of locally owned shops, and home to regular public events like the annual [[Diamond Teeth Mary]] Blues Festival, named for the blues singer born in the town.

===Marshall University===
{{Main|Marshall University}}

At the time of Huntington's founding, Holderby's Landing was already the home of [[Normal School|Marshall College State Normal School]] (now [[Marshall University]]). The university was founded in 1837 as a private [[secondary school|subscription school]] by residents of Guyandotte and the surrounding area. The landmark [[Old Main (Marshall University)|Old Main]], which now serves as the primary administrative building for the university, was built on land known as Maple Grove, at the time the home of the Mount Hebron Church in what was then the [[US state|state]] of [[Virginia]].<ref name="OM_1837">Brown, Lisle, ed.[http://www.marshall.edu/library/speccoll/virtual_museum/old_main/1837-building.asp "Marshall Academy, 1837."] Marshall University Special Collections.

The university is composed of eight undergraduate colleges and schools: the College of Liberal Arts (COLA), the College of Fine Arts (COFA), the College of Education and Human Services (COEHS), the College of Information Technology and Engineering (CITE), the Elizabeth McDowell Lewis College of Business (LCOB), the College of Science (COS), the College of Health Professions (COHP), and the College of Arts and Media (CAM), and five graduate colleges, the general Graduate College, the Graduate School of Education and Professional Development, the School of Pharmacy, the School of Physical Therapy, and the [[Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine]], a regional center for cancer research which has a national reputation for its programs in rural health care delivery.

Marshall's sports teams are known as the "Thundering Herd." The home field for the football program is James F. Edwards Field at the [[Joan C. Edwards Stadium]]. Basketball is played at the [[Cam Henderson Center]]. Soccer is played at Veterans Memorial Soccer Stadium, and the baseball teams are awaiting a new stadium. The school colors are kelly green and white. Marshall participates in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] ([[Division I (NCAA)#Division I-A|FBS]] for [[American football|football]]) as a member of [[Conference USA]]. The name Thundering Herd came from a [[Zane Grey]] novel released in 1925, and a silent movie of the same two years later. Marshall teams were originally known as the Indians, and the green-white colors came in 1903, replacing black and blue. [[The Herald-Dispatch]] sports editor Carl "Duke" Ridgley tagged the team with the Thundering Herd name, but many other nicknames were suggested over the next thirty years, including Boogercats, Big Green, Green Gobblers, Rams, Judges and others. In 1965, students, alums and faculty settled on Thundering Herd in a vote, and Big Green was given to the athletic department's fund-raising wing. Sports at the school include women's [[softball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] & [[diving]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], and [[track & field]]; men's [[American football|football]], [[baseball]]; and teams for both genders in [[basketball]], [[cross country running|cross country]], [[golf]], and [[soccer]].<ref name="herdzone">{{cite web|url=http://herdzone.cstv.com/s-finder/mars-s-finder.html|title=HERDZONE.COM – The Marshall University Thundering Herd Official Athletic Site – Sports Finder|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> Marshall also fields club teams, not affiliated with the MU Athletic Department, in [[rugby union]] for both women and men, men's and women's [[lacrosse]], and an equestrian team that competes in the [[Intercollegiate Horse Show Association]].

====Southern Airways Flight 932====
{{Main|Southern Airways Flight 932}}

[[File:MUcrash1970MemSpringHill.jpg|right|thumb|Memorial at Spring Hill Cemetery to the victims of the 1970 plane crash.]] On November 14, 1970, a chartered [[Southern Airways]] [[McDonnell-Douglas DC-9]] jet transporting 75 [[Marshall University]] football players, coaches, staff, and supporters crashed just short of the [[Tri-State Airport]] in adjoining [[Ceredo, West Virginia]]. Everyone on board was killed.

The story was dramatized in the [[Warner Bros.]] motion picture ''[[We Are Marshall]]'', starring Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox. The film was released locally on December 12, 2006, and nationally on December 22, 2006. The movie depicts the aftermath of the aviation disaster for the families and university.

===Climate===
Because of its position in the westernmost and lowest area of the state, the city is on the northern limits of a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wchstv.com/newsroom/wx/climatesummary.shtml |title=Charleston-Huntington Climate Summary – Eyewitness News Storm Team Weather |publisher=Wchstv.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}</ref> unlike the [[Highland (geography)|"highlands"]] of West Virginia, which are in the [[Allegheny Mountains]] and the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. This location gives the city a perfect four seasons, with each season beginning around the calendar date. Huntington is made humid by the Ohio River, but summers are not as hot as they are further south and west. Snowfall generally falls in moderate amounts, accumulating an average {{convert|23|in|cm|0}} seasonally, and the greatest 24-hour fall was {{convert|21.1|in|cm}} during the March [[1993 Storm of the Century]]. Each year on average, 24 days reach {{convert|90|°F|1}} and 16–17 days stay below freezing. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|108|°F|0}} on July 28, 1930, and the lowest was {{convert|−24|°F|0}} on [[Great Blizzard of 1899|February 9, 1899]].

[[File:Old Main Corridor.jpg|thumb|The Old Main Corridor, as seen from [[Marshall University]] in May 2013.]]

Huntington's central business district is directly between the [[Ohio River]] and the CSX Railroad track, east of the [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]], and west of Hal Greer Blvd (16th Street). There are also 2 smaller business districts: "Old Central City," well known for its antique shops, and one in Guyandotte. The city also has a wealth of architecture, including Gothic, Art Deco, and Edwardian Renaissance, along with many Craftsman, Colonial, Classical, and Tudor Revival homes.

Shortly after Pullman Square was constructed, the city began upgrading the streetscape on 9th Street and the "Old Main Corridor" section of 4th Avenue. 9th Street was formerly known as the Ninth Street Plaza and was closed to vehicle traffic for years, which effectively killed most businesses there. Once anchored by Pullman Square on the north end, the old plaza was removed in 2006 and 9th Street has once again begun attracting businesses. The section of Fourth Avenue that connects downtown to Marshall University, known as the "Old Main Corridor," has also been upgraded recently. The corridor is being upgraded yearly with new lighting, artistic and pedestrian-friendly design concepts, and bicycle lanes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-South/Huntington-Economy.html |title=Huntington: Economy – Major Industries and Commercial Activity |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}</ref>

[[File:StoneAndThomasRenovation.jpg|thumb|left|Historic Third Avenue across from Pullman Square, showing the renovation of the old [[Stone & Thomas]] Building.]]
[[Marshall University]] recently purchased the old Anderson-Newcomb/[[Stone & Thomas]] Building, which was built in 1902, with the intent of converting that historic structure into a state-of-the-art visual arts center. The goal being to raise the college’s presence as an innovative institution, give the visual art program more space to expand, and afford students more opportunities to become engaged in community initiatives and improve the quality of life for everyone in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marshall.edu/cofa/art/|title=Art and Design Student donates sculpture|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>

Since its founding as the western terminus of the C&O Railroad, Huntington has served as a major break of bulk point between rail traffic and the [[Ohio River]]/[[Mississippi River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. The Huntington Division is still the largest in the [[CSX Transportation]] network. A large portion of the division's revenue comes from hauling coal out of the coalfields of [[West Virginia]] and Eastern [[Kentucky]]. The Huntington District is the largest of 10 operating divisions on the network. It serves the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio. CSX's Huntington Division main office is in the historic former C&O passenger station downtown.<ref name="facebook">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/CSX-Huntington-Division-Photography-and-Videography-HDPV/182716188518297?id=182716188518297&sk=info|title=CSX Huntington Division Photography and Videography – HDPV|work=Facebook|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>

===Downtown Historic District===
[[File:Reattaching the Keith Albee Sign.jpg|thumb|The [[Keith-Albee Theatre|Keith Albee]]'s sign being reinstalled over Fourth Avenue in the [[Downtown Huntington Historic District|Downtown Historic District]] in 2012.]] 
The [[Downtown Huntington Historic District]] is a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]]. The original district encompassed 59 contributing buildings; a boundary increase added 53 more contributing buildings. It includes the central business district and several municipal and governmental buildings. It contains the majority of the historic concentration of downtown commercial buildings.

Notable buildings include Huntington City Hall, Johnson Memorial Church (c.1886/1912/1935), Trinity Episcopal Church (1882), Davis Opera House (c. 1885), Love Hardware Building (c. 1884), the Broh Building (1885), The Wesvanawha Building (1929-originally Lewis Building), the Anderson-Newcomb/[[Stone & Thomas]] Building (c. 1902), the Frederick Building (1906) the Morrison Building (1919), [[Keith-Albee Theater]] (1928), West Virginia Building (c. 1924), and the Gideon Building (c. 1915).

Arguably, the most famous attraction in Huntington is  [[Keith-Albee Theatre]], a former [[Vaudeville]] palace in the "Art Deco" style from the 1920s and one of the architectural masterpieces of Downtown Huntington, on Fourth Avenue. Now known as the Keith Albee Performing Arts Center, the Keith was originally built in 1928 as the Keith-Albee Theater, and under the supervision of vaudeville tycoons B. F. Keith and Edward Albee as part of their Keith-Albee vaudeville circuit, the Keith-Albee was the second-largest theater in the United States at that time, behind the Roxy in New York City. The theater was designed by [[Thomas W. Lamb]] who designed approximately 153 theaters around the world. Unfortunately, only forty-three of these grand theaters are still open, and seventy-one have been demolished. Thankfully, "the Keith" has been undergoing a full restoration since 2009.

The signature achievement in the restoration of the Keith was the restoration of the famous front sign in 2012. After standing watch over Fourth Avenue for decades and being featured in hundreds of pictures and postcards, two Hollywood movie premieres, and being struck by lightning numerous times; the sign had to be taken down in 2011. A massive "Save Our Sign" effort was organized that funded the full restoration of the sign, which was reinstalled in May 2012.

==Law enforcement==
The [[Huntington Police Department (HPD)|Huntington Police Department]] (HPD) is the primary law enforcement agency serving Huntington. The Huntington Police Department traces its history to 1872 with the appointment of Isaac H. Mitchell as the first Town Marshal of the city.  The citizens of Huntington are protected by 111 sworn officers and a professional support staff of 13 civilians. Citing double-digit drops in overall crime, and drops of more than 20% in violent crime, HPD has been recognized by the U.S. Attorney's Office as the "Law Enforcement Agency of the Year" for 2011 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hpdwv.com/about.php|title=Huntington Police Department • About Us|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>

Law enforcement and security for Marshall University is provided by the Marshall University Police Department. This protection includes the main campus area (including the streets on or immediately surrounding campus) as well as all other university owned or managed buildings and property, including the Marshall University Medical Center at Cabell Huntington Hospital.

As the enforcement arm of the [[Cabell County]] court system, the Cabell County Sheriff's Office is responsible for the security of the Court House and property, public schools, service of court-ordered writs, protective and peace orders, warrants, tax levies, prisoner transportation and traffic enforcement. Deputy Sheriffs are sworn law enforcement officials, with full arrest authority anywhere in Cabell County granted by the constitution of West Virginia and the county Sheriff.

In addition to both municipal and county law enforcement agencies, Huntington is also home to a detachment of the [[West Virginia State Police]]. Troopers from this detachment are assigned to both Cabell and Wayne counties and can serve as a backup to any neighboring counties.

==Huntington Fire Department==
[[File:HFDTrucksAtStationOne.JPG|thumb|right|Huntington Fire Department trucks at Station #1.]]
The city of Huntington is protected by 106 professional firefighters of the Huntington Fire Department (HFD), founded in 1897. The department currently provides nine fully staffed companies with a compliment of support staff and apparatus responding from six strategically located fire stations throughout the city. The six stations consist of six engine companies, two ladder trucks, a rescue truck, a marine unit, and several reserve engines, reserve utility trucks, and staff vehicles.

Huntington is on the southern bank of the Ohio River and is the river's largest port area. The Huntington Fire Department is capable of water/underwater rescue operations and is the host locality to the Regional # 6 West Virginia Regional Response Team which provides Hazardous Materials and Technical Rescue Team responses. The department holds a Class 2 rating from the Insurance Services Office (ISO) and was the first department in the State to achieve this status. Last departmental evaluation was performed in 2010.

===History===
The problem of organizing for protection against fire was not given much thought until 1874, when A.C. Young and a group of associates organized a hook and ladder company. Young was given City Council authorization to contract for a hand-drawn hook and ladder truck. The Council approved $450 toward the purchase of the new truck. It was built locally by M.A. Jones, and Huntington's first fire company was born. In 1874, the city council enacted an ordinance creating a fire department to consist of an Engine Company, a Hose Company, and the previously formed Hook & Ladder Company. Mr. S. Sexton was named fire chief, and the personnel was all volunteer. in May 1875 the city purchased a hand-operated engine and a hand-drawn hose reel from Portsmouth, Ohio, for $725. To provide a water supply for the department, large 500 gallon cisterns were made in numerous locations in the city. On August 5, 1875, the organization was complete and the department was ready for action. A tower bell for alarms was bought in 1875 and more cisterns were placed in 1876.

[[File:HFDFireBox.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An original Gamewell Fire Alarm Box in front of Centennial Fire Station No. 1.]]
Thomas Sikes was Captain of Hook and Ladder Co. No. 1, and Eustance Gibson was Captain of Excelsior Fire Engine and Hose Co. No. 2. Both were Civil War veterans, well known and respected early settlers. Many of the volunteer personnel composed of well known early settlers, merchants and professional men, many of whose descendants are living in Huntington today. In 1876 a night-watchman was hired at $3 per month to look after the station at night and sound the alarm in case of a fire. This was the first paid employee of the fire department. In 1879 J.W. Verlander became the first Fire Chief, and J.M. Boone became chief in 1880 until 1895. In 1881, four Gamewell Fire Alarm Boxes were installed in the downtown area. These fire alarm boxes were maintained by the telephone company. The system kept growing, and in 1928 construction was completed on a new Gamewell Fire Alarm System and Fire Alarm Headquarters were placed in operation in 1929, and remained in service until 7:32AM November 1, 1986. The Gamewell Fire Alarm System served the City of Huntington faithfully for 105 years. There never was a loss of life or major disaster because of a system malfunction.

In 1883 the department first and only horse-drawn steam fire engine was purchased from the Ahrens-Fox Fire Engine Company of Cincinnati. The engine was brought up the Ohio River to Huntington on a steamboat. Also in 1883 the department was reorganized on a part-paid basis, but continued to be largely volunteer until 1897 when the department was again reorganized with a paid chief, four paid drivers and a force of firefighters who were paid by each alarm they answered. Each firefighter held down regular jobs the rest of the time. This was the beginning of Huntington's full-time paid fire department.

From 1913 to 1915 five pieces of motorized equipment were bought for the department. These consisted of a chief's car, two hose trucks, a pumping engine and an {{convert|85|ft|abbr=on}} aerial ladder truck. This was the beginning of motorization. In April 1926 the last two teams of horse-drawn hose companies were led away from Hose Companies No. 5 in Guyandotte and No. 6 in Walnut Hills.. The day of the dashing fire horse was over. The old St. Clouds Fire Station is the city's reminder of the horse-drawn era. The horse-bitten window sills still remain today.

In February 1929 Huntington's firefighters were issued a charter establishing a local union. Under the International Association of Fire Fighters, Huntington's firefighters were given the 289th local in the U.S. and Canada

[[File:FirePreventionParade2010.jpg|thumb|The 2010 Fire Prevention Parade on Fourth Avenue.]]
The Fire Prevention Bureau was established in the early fifties, because of the increasing number of fires in homes and businesses, along with the city's Fire Prevention Week. Early functions of the Bureau included the Fire Prevention Parade and a contest to select Miss Flame, a beauty queen to reign over the weeks activities. All contestants in the competition were required to have red hair in the earlier years. The Fire Prevention Parade was held the first Monday in October, and a tradition that is carried on today since the fifties. Fire Departments from West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky participate annually in Huntington's Fire Prevention Parade. The Huntington Fire Department implemented the School Fire Patrol Program in the city in 1950. This programs said to be one of the oldest in the nation today. Other events in the mid to late fifties included the establishment of the Tri-State Fire School. The Tri-State Fire School is still used today to train firefighters.

In 1965, the city built its first new fire station since 1926. The city's 100th birthday was commemorated when the Centennial Fire Station was placed in service on January 13, 1972, replacing the long-outmoded Central Fire Station. The Centennial Fire Station is still in service today. In 2004, a new station was opened that replaced St. Cloud station 4. The old station has been in service as a fire house for over 100 years. It now houses the traffic division for the City Of Huntington. The 1980s were tough for the department, several firefighters retired, and budget cuts forced the closure of several stations. The Gamewell Fire Alarm System was deactivated and Fire Alarm Headquarters closed. (The Old Fire Alarm Headquarters has been converted into a fire museum today.) Dispatching was combined with the Police Department, marking the beginning of 911 emergency dispatching.

==Health care==
[[File:Smmc-heart-er.jpg|right|thumb|St. Mary's Medical Center's new regional heart institute and emergency department.]]
The two largest hospitals in Huntington are [[St. Mary's Medical Center (Huntington)|St. Mary's Medical Center]] and [[Cabell Huntington Hospital]]. St. Mary's and Cabell-Huntington are jointly designated as the only trauma center in the region. St. Mary's is the largest medical facility in the tri-state region. The medical center is the largest private employer in [[Cabell County, West Virginia|Cabell County]] with over 2,600 employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.st-marys.org/about|title=About St. Mary's|author=Bulldog Creative Services|date=|work=St. Mary's Medical Center|accessdate=November 6, 2015}}</ref> As a teaching facility associated with the Joan C. Edwards [[Marshall University]] School of Medicine, St. Mary's trains medical residents in several specialties. The hospital campus is home to the St. Mary's School of Nursing, the St. Mary's School of Radiologic Technology, and the St. Mary’s School of Respiratory Care. All three programs are associated with Marshall University. St. Mary's is also home to a regional heart institute, regional cancer center, and regional neuroscience center.

[[File:Cabell Huntington Hospital.jpg|left|thumb|Cabell-Huntington Hospital viewed along Hal Greer Blvd.]]
Cabell Huntington Hospital is a not-for-profit, regional referral center with 303 staffed beds. Cabell Huntington cares for patients from more than 29 counties throughout West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. Opened in 1956, it is also a teaching hospital and home to the Marshall University Medical Center, which includes the Joan C. Edwards Schools of Medicine and Nursing. Cabell Huntington is also home to the Edwards Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Hoops Family Children's Hospital, and the Robert C. Byrd Center for Rural Health; a distinguished leader nationwide for rural health care delivery.

[[File:HuntingtonVAHospital.JPG|thumb|The main building of the Huntington VA Hospital.]]
The Huntington [[Veteran's Administration]] (VA) Medical Center, on Spring Valley Drive, is an 80-bed medical and surgical care facility that offers primary inpatient and outpatient care, along with mental health services and subspeciality outpatient options. It is also the primary teaching facility for the Marshall University School of Medicine and is also affiliated with the [[University of Pikeville Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine]]. In 1993, the [[Robert C. Byrd]] Clinical Addition expanded the hospital's surgery, radiology, laboratory, cardiology, nuclear medicine, and rehabilitation services and renovated inpatient care facilities. In 1998, a $10 million research facility was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.va.gov/directory/guide/facility.asp?ID=749&dnum=ALL&map=1 |title= Huntington VA Medical Center, Department of Veteran Affairs | accessdate=October 10, 2006}}</ref> The hospital is also the home of the [[Marshall University]] School of Pharmacy.

The city is also home to the state's largest psychiatric hospital, Mildred Mitchell-Bateman Hospital.

==Economy==
[[File:Amazon Customer Service Center Huntington.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amazon.com|Amazon Customer Service Center]] in Kinetic Park.]]
The growth of Huntington and its economy was originally based on steel processing, shipping, manufacturing, and transportation through the 1970s, then the city experienced [[deindustrialization]] which cost residents tens of thousands of low-skill, high-wage jobs. Huntington has since been adapting to the collapse of the region's steel industry. The primary industries have shifted to high technology, such as, the film and television industries, health care, [[biomedical technology]], finance, tourism, and the service sector. The Amazon Customer Service Center in Huntington employs approximately 500–700 people.

Huntington has grown its economic base in recent years to include technology, retail, finance, education, and medical care (which constitutes the largest proportion of the city's employment). The largest employers are [[Marshall University]], [[Cabell Huntington Hospital]], [[St. Mary's Medical Center (Huntington)|St. Mary’s Medical Center]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[DirecTV]], and the City of Huntington.<ref name="Huntington in Bloom" />

Area retail is anchored by the [[Huntington Mall]], the largest mall in the state, and a healthy downtown retail sector including many boutique shops along the Old Main Corridor, Third Avenue, and Pullman Square.

The newest area of development is Kinetic Park, a premier technology park on Sixteenth Street, 1/4 mile north of [[interstate 64]]. The flagship of the development is Amazon's new {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. Customer Service Center, which opened in November 2011. Other development in Kinetic Park includes a Spring Hill Suites by Marriott hotel, a Hampton Inn hotel, a Bob Evans restaurant, Goldy Chrysler, and the Huntington Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics clinic.

[[File:CO-Class-L.jpg|thumb|left|Huntington-built C&O class L [[4-6-4]] locomotive #490 displaying [[streamliner|streamlining]] applied to several passenger train locomotives in the 1930s]]
The first large manufacturing business in Huntington was the Ensign Car Works, founded in Huntington in 1872 by [[Ely Ensign]] and [[William Henry Barnum|William H. Barnum]], who managed a car wheel manufacturing company, the Barnum and Richardson Company, in [[Connecticut]]. The company was incorporated on November 1, 1872.<ref name=MCRM>{{cite web| url=http://www.midcontinent.org/rollingstock/builders/ensign.htm| title=Ensign Manufacturing Company| publisher=Mid-Continent Railway Museum| date=April 9, 2006| accessdate=April 15, 2008}}</ref>  Financing was provided primarily by Barnum and [[Collis Potter Huntington|Collis P. Huntington]], who was one of the principals in the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] and founder of the City of Huntington.<ref>White, p 142.</ref>

For the first ten years of production, Ensign manufactured iron parts such as railroad car wheels. The company began building wooden [[freight car]]s in the early 1880s, selling a large portion of its inventory to the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad|Chesapeake and Ohio]], [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] and [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] railroads, all of which were controlled by Huntington.<ref name=MCRM /> In 1962, the Huntington [[Ensign Manufacturing Company|ACF]] plant began building a revolutionary new design that quickly became the standard of the rail car industry. The car, known as the CenterFlow [[covered hopper car]], was developed by ACF to transport huge volumes of light-weight, high-bulk commodities, such as plastic pellets. By 1992, ACF had manufactured more than 100,000 hopper cars. The sprawling ACF Industries rail car plant once had many as 1,600 employees with an annual payroll of $30 million. Now, reports indicate only four people work there – and three of them are security guards.

[[File:CSXHuntingtonDivisionHeadquarters.JPG|thumb|The former [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway|C&O Depot]], now [[CSX Transportation|CSX-Huntington Division Headquarters]], with the statue of [[Collis P. Huntington]] by [[Gutzon Borglum]] in the foreground.]] Since its founding as the western terminus of the C&O Railroad, Huntington has served as a major break of bulk point between rail traffic and the Ohio River/[[Mississippi River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. The Huntington Division is still the largest in the [[CSX Transportation]] network. A large portion of the division's revenue comes from hauling coal out of the coalfields of [[West Virginia]] and eastern [[Kentucky]]. Much of the coal is brought to the [[Port of Huntington-Tristate]] by train to be transported by river [[barge]]s to industrial centers in other states.

Huntington is in the company's Southern Region and is the largest of ten operating divisions on the network. The division comprises the former railroads Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O); Baltimore and Ohio (B&O); Western Maryland (WM); Louisville and Nashville (L&N); and the Clinchfield. It serves the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio. CSX's Huntington Division main office is in the historical former C&O passenger station downtown. The office is home to a regional office that is home to the divisions's top managers, a centralized yardmasters and train dispatchers center, a freight car light repair shop and a locomotive heavy repair facility in the city.<ref name="facebook" />

Huntington is also home to [[Heiner's Bakery]]. Founded in 1905, Heiner's employs nearly 500 people in its {{convert|130000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility. The bakery was privately owned by the Heiner family, and marketed exclusively under the "Heiner's" label until it was acquired by the Earthgrains division of Anheuser-Busch in 1994. Six months later, A-B spun off its bread business as the stand-alone Earthgrains Corporation. In 2000, Earthgrains merged with the [[Sara Lee Corporation]]. In 2011, Sara Lee sold its bread business, including the trademark Sara Lee, to the worldwide [[Grupo Bimbo]], which is based in Mexico City. Today the bakery markets under the "Heiner's", "Earthgrains", "Sara Lee" and "Bimbo" brands.<ref>{{cite web|author=Heiner's Bakery|title=About Us|url=http://www.heinersbakery.com/about.html}}</ref>

Huntington is still a base for the metalworking and welding trades with the repair of railroad rolling stock, barges, and river boat equipment. Major fabricating firms—such as Huntington Special Metals, Steel of West Virginia, Martin Steel, Huntington Plating, Richwood Industries, Evans Welding and Fabricating Co, and Hammers Industries—serve the railroads, river transportation, steelmaking, coal, oil, natural gas, electrical, windpower, biofuel, and other important industries.

==Culture==
Although situated in a [[Southern United States|Southern state]], Huntington was originally considered a [[American frontier|western]] city. Huntington is influenced by [[Appalachia|Appalachian Culture]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern culture]], [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern culture]], and [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic culture]]. It is sometimes referred to as one of the northernmost cities in the [[Southern United States|South]] or one of the southernmost cities in the [[Union (American Civil War)|North]].

The [[Keith-Albee Theatre|Keith-Albee Performing Arts Center]] is in Huntington.

===Ritter Park===
The crown jewel of the public park system is Ritter Park (named for Charles L. Ritter, who donated the land), on land originally purchased as the site for an incinerator. The park is maintained by the Greater Huntington Park and Recreation District. It was created in 1913 by Rufus Switzer, a city council member of West Virginia.<ref name="American Planning Association">{{cite web|title=Great Places in America: Public Spaces|url=http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/spaces/2012/#WV|publisher=American Planning Association|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> It consists of numerous lengthy walking and cycling trails along Four Pole Creek, which runs the entire length of the park and is crossed by many wooden and stone [[footbridge]]s.There are also restroom facilities, picnic tables, a shelter with grills and electrical outlets, a children's playground, an amphitheater for small concerts and plays, an award-winning rose garden, and a new dog park.

[[File:FootbridgesAtRitterPark.jpg|left|thumb|A few of the footbridges across Four Pole Creek below the Rose Garden and the "Room with a View" in Ritter Park.]] 
The park was officially opened in September 1913. Architect Gus Wofford was hired by the city to design the park and its amenities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Great Places in America: Public Spaces|url=http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/spaces/2012/#WV|publisher=Americal Planning Association (APA)|accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> His works continued till the 1930s and includes bridges that cross streams, tennis courts, greenhouse, and picnic facilities.<ref name="American Planning Association"/> It is in the [[Ritter Park Historic District]], listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1990.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

===Paul Ambrose Trail for Health (PATH)===
[[File:AmbroseTrail.jpg|thumb|The Paul Ambrose Trail for Health (PATH) going under the Fifth Avenue and [[East Huntington Bridge|Thirty-first Street]] bridges.]]
The Huntington area has wrestled with health problems for several years, problems that were made famous in 2010 by the television show Jamie Oliver’s [[Food Revolution]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Before and since, concerned Huntingtonians have been working to improve the health and quality of life in the city of Huntington. One of the more popular projects has been the Paul Ambrose Trail for Health.

The Paul Ambrose Trail for Health (PATH) is a growing, bicycle and pedestrian trail system in the City of Huntington. It is designed to create interconnected loops around each of the neighborhood parks that would create recreational opportunities and an alternate means of transportation around the city. The namesake, Dr. Paul Ambrose, was a promising young physician who was killed at the Pentagon in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Dr. Ambrose was dedicated to family health and preventative medicine to fight obesity and the trail system is a way for his efforts to continue to have an impact in Huntington.

The Rahall Transportation Institute Foundation, in association with the City of Huntington and various community members, has designed this trail system to incorporate many of Huntington’s amenities and workplaces to allow the citizens of Huntington an alternate means of transportation. The PATH is vital in Huntington’s continued efforts towards the redevelopment and growth of the City, because it will help cut congestion, connect business and communities, and provide healthy recreational opportunities for residents.

===Memorial Park===
Memorial Park is at 1301 Memorial Boulevard. It contains a walking trail, a small playground, a picnic shelter, and a small restroom. It formerly included a large swimming pool that featured two slides, but was abandoned and demolished in 2006. The two-mile (3&nbsp;km) walking trail merges with the one-mile (1.6&nbsp;km) trail around the main Ritter Park at 8th Street & North Blvd.

===Harveytown Park===
Harveytown Park is one of the newest parks in the [[Harveytown District of Huntington, West Virginia|Harveytown district]]. It currently features six picnic tables, one of which is handicap accessible, an electrical outlet, a grill, water fountain, and restrooms. Construction on Phase I of the new park began on October 28, 2003. The financing and coordination was a joint effort between the city of Huntington, HUD CDBG funds, and the [[Greater Huntington Park and Recreation District]]. During Phase I, the initial park site was cleared and prepared, underground utilities were installed, a main entrance and parking lot was constructed, and the picnic shelter was installed. The shelter was unique in that it was both aesthetically pleasing and functional. Possible expansion plans include a skateboard facility, bicycle trails and tennis courts.<ref>Smith, Sheanna.

[[Camden Park (amusement park)|Camden Park]] is a {{convert|26|acre|m2|adj=on}} amusement park near Huntington. It is a traditional park home to over 30 rides and attractions. The park features two of the three remaining roller coasters built by National Amusement Devices. The '''Big Dipper''', a [[wooden roller coaster]] constructed in 1958, features the original Century Flyer cars complete with headlights and detail work [http://www.coastergallery.com/2000/cam06.html]. The coaster is classified as an ACE Coaster Classic by the [[American Coaster Enthusiasts]] [http://www.rcdb.com/installationresult.htm?column=1,2,3,26,4,5&order=1,2&category=107]. The park's second coaster, the '''Lil' Dipper''' was completed in 1961 and is also an ACE Coaster Classic. '''The Whip''' at Camden park is an original built by Coney Island, New York's [[William F. Mangels]]. It is one of a handful of these classic flat-rides still in existence. The park is also home to several entertainment events which take place throughout the year: Children's Festival, Hot Summer Nights Concert Series, Coca-Cola Days, and Halloween Spooktacular.

Camden Park was originally built in 1903 at the western terminus of the trolley line (then owned by the [[Ohio Valley Electric Railway|Camden Interstate Railway Company]]) to encourage ridership. Camden Park is now owned by the Boylin Family. This is the second generation of Boylins owning and operating West Virginia's only amusement park. J. P. Boylin transformed Camden Park from a carousel to an amusement park in 1950. By the late 19th century almost every large town in America had streetcars and many had parks to boost weekend and holiday traffic. Originally developed as a picnic area by the Camden Interstate Railway in 1903 Camden Park has survived into the 21st century as a thriving traditional amusement park. Over the years Camden Park has been the setting for baseball games, tens of thousands of picnics, fairs, marathon dances, roller derbies, flagpole sitting, a swimming pool, a zoo, plus numerous attractions and rides.<ref>[http://www.camdenpark.com/information/ Our History].

===Beech Fork State Park===
[[File:Beech Fork State Park Lake.jpg|right|thumb|[[Beech Fork Lake]] at [[Beech Fork State Park]].]]
[[Beech Fork State Park]] is in [[Cabell County, West Virginia|Cabell County]] and [[Wayne County, West Virginia]], roughly {{convert|15|mi|km}} south of downtown Huntington. The park is on the tailwater shores of [[Beech Fork Lake]], a flood control impoundment of the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] on the Beech Fork of [[Twelvepole Creek]]. Since its development in the mid 1970s, Beech Fork State Park has proven to be a popular recreation spot for the residents of nearby [[Barboursville, West Virginia|Barboursville]] and Huntington, as well as those living in the surrounding region. The park is about {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of the [[Hal Greer]] exit (Exit 11) of [[Interstate 64]]. Access to the park is also available from Exits 8, 15, and 20 of [[I-64]]. The [[Beech Fork Lake]] Dam and Marina are about a 20-mile (40 minute) drive from the park.

[[Beech Fork State Park]] is home to [[Beech Fork Lake]], a <span style="white-space:nowrap">{{convert|720|acre|adj=on}}</span> [[reservoir]] near [[Lavalette, West Virginia|Lavalette]] in [[Wayne County, West Virginia|Wayne County]], [[West Virginia]]. Beech Fork Lake is also partly located in neighboring [[Cabell County, West Virginia|Cabell County]]. Millers Fork and Stowers Branch join Beech Fork with their own river valleys contributing to the majority of the lakesurface of Beech Fork Lake. These streams are [[tributary|tributaries]] of [[Twelvepole Creek]].

Beech Fork Lake as a flood control impoundment was authorized by the [[Flood Control Act]] of October 23, 1962 and was constructed by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] in the mid-1970s. The lake was completed and dedicated in May 1978.

Known in agrarian times as the "Bean Capital of the World" because of its abundant harvests, remote Beech Fork and its fertile farms had by the mid-20th century devolved into a [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/tobacco+road "Tobacco Road"] cut off from the opportunities of modern development. Some tombstones in the Park's Bowen Cemetery date to the 18th century; and family names adorning Civil War graves can be seen on roadside mailboxes even today. Government appropriation of private land for the lake caused rancor among locals with historic land holdings. The Beech Fork strain of [[Adkins]] family (appropriately known as "Beech Fork Adkinses") was largely driven out to the [[Huntington, West Virginia metropolitan area|Huntington metropolitan area]]. So numerous were these displaced persons that townsfolk joked about an "Adkins factory" at Beech Fork which mass-produced persons of the surname. It has also been said that in the last days, "the Jews will go back to Palestine and the Adkinses will go back to Beech Fork."

==Sports==
[[File:StudentSectionAtTheJoan.jpg|thumb|Pregame at [[Joan C. Edwards Stadium|"The Joan"]] as seen from the student section in September 2012.]]
Huntington's sports scene is dominated by Marshall University athletics and [[Huntington Prep School|Huntington Prep basketball]].

===The Thundering Herd===
Marshall's sports teams are known as the ''Thundering Herd''. The school colors are kelly green and white. Marshall participates in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] ([[Division I (NCAA)#Division I-A|FBS]] for [[American football|football]]) as a member of [[Conference USA]]. The name Thundering Herd came from a [[Zane Grey]] novel released in 1925, and a silent movie of the same two years later. Marshall teams were originally known as the Indians, and the green-white colors came in 1903, replacing black and blue. ''[[The Herald-Dispatch]]'' sports editor Carl "Duke" Ridgley tagged the team with the Thundering Herd name, but many other nicknames were suggested over the next thirty years, including Boogercats, Big Green, Green Gobblers, Rams, Judges and others. In 1965, students, alums and faculty settled on Thundering Herd in a vote, and Big Green was given to the athletic department's fund-raising wing.

Sports at the school include women's [[softball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]] & [[diving]], [[tennis]], [[volleyball]], and [[track & field]]; men's [[American football|football]], [[baseball]]; and teams for both genders in [[basketball]] [[cross country running|cross country]], [[golf]], and [[soccer]].<ref name="herdzone" /> Marshall also fields club teams, not affiliated with the MU Athletic Department, in [[rugby union]] for both women and men, men's and women's [[lacrosse]], and an equestrian team that competes in the [[Intercollegiate Horse Show Association]].

===Interstates and highways===
The [[roads of Huntington, West Virginia]] include one major interstate, [[Interstate 64 (West Virginia)|Interstate 64]]; two U.S. highways, [[U.S. Route 60 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 60]] and [[U.S. Route 52 (West Virginia)|U.S. Route 52]]; 6 state routes; and numerous major thoroughfares. Huntington utilizes a grid-like street pattern featuring several wide [[boulevard|boulevard-style]] avenues that run east and west. Most notable of these are Third and Fifth Avenues. The city has a numbered street naming system, with avenues running east and west (parallel to the Ohio River) and streets running north and south. The city is divided into an "East End" and a "West End" by First Street. Streets west of First Street carry as "West" indicator after the street name (i.e. "Fourteenth Street West"). The street plan was originally laid out by [[Andrew J. Enslow]], a professional contractor, making Huntington one of the first professionally planned cities in America.

[[File:I-64.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 64 in West Virginia|Interstate 64]], which skirts the South Hills with four interchanges that serve the city: [[U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia|US 52]] ([[West Huntington Expressway]]), [[West Virginia Route 152|WV 152]]/[[West Virginia Route 527|WV 527]], [[West Virginia Route 10|WV 10]], and [[U.S. Route 60 in West Virginia|US 60]]. Exits 6 through 15 service the City of Huntington. [[U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia|US 52]] is at exit 6. Heading north on the four-lane expressway leads to West Huntington and across the [[West Huntington Bridge]] into [[Ohio]]. Heading south overlaps the interstate west towards Kenova, where US 52 exits and heads south paralleling with the [[Big Sandy River (Ohio River)|Big Sandy River]]. This is at exit 1. '''Exit 8: ''' Similar to exit 11, [[West Virginia Route 527|WV 527]]'s southern terminus lies at the north side of I-64. [[West Virginia Route 152|WV 152]] makes its northern terminus on the south side of the interstate. The two highways are the renumbered U.S. 52 that moved to a new route in 1979 south of Kenova. Both routes terminate into each other at exit 8. '''Exit 11: ''' Hal Greer Boulevard ([[West Virginia Route 10|WV 10]]), north of I-64. South of I-64 the highway is known is 16th Street Road. The quickest way to [[Marshall University]] is at exit 11. '''Exit 15: ''' [[U.S. Route 60 in West Virginia|US 60]] near [[West Pea Ridge, West Virginia|West Pea Ridge]]. US 60 west heads toward downtown.

U.S. 60 heads toward downtown, splitting into the 3rd and 5th avenues, just west of the WV 2 terminus. U.S. Route 60 parallels the [[Ohio River]] through downtown, and merges into a four-lane undivided highway after crossing under the West Huntington Expressway (U.S. Route 52) in the West End. U.S. 60 exits the city in the west near the [[Camden Park (amusement park)|Camden Park]].

[[File:US 52.svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 52 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 52]] ([[West Huntington Expressway]]) is a four lane expressway that enters Huntington from [[Ohio]] via the [[West Huntington Bridge]] from [[Chesapeake, Ohio]] in the north, and heads south crossing U.S. 60 in the West End. U.S. 52 then turns west, overlapping Interstate 64 beginning at exit 6, just south of Huntington city limits. U.S. 52 and I-64 stay concurrent for {{convert|5|mi|km}} in an easterly direction until reaching Exit 1, signed as the Kenova-Ceredo exit. Along with [[West Virginia Route 75]], U.S. 52 heads south from the intersection, paralleling the [[Big Sandy River (Ohio River)|Big Sandy River]] and [[US 23 (KY)|US 23]], which parallels the river on the [[Kentucky]] side of the river. From one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) south of Kenova, it is known as the Tolsia Highway for many miles through Wayne County.

[[File:WV-2.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 2]] makes its southern terminus just north of Huntington at U.S. Route 60. [[West Virginia Route 2|WV 2]], which parallels the entirety of West Virginia's section of the [[Ohio River]], and facilitates much traffic towards [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia|Point Pleasant]] and [[Parkersburg, West Virginia|Parkersburg]].

[[File:WV-10.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 10]] follows the Guyandotte River for much of its length and connects Huntington to [[Princeton, West Virginia|Princeton]]. It enters the city south of [[Interstate 64 in West Virginia|Interstate 64]] at [[Hal Greer|Hal Greer Boulevard]]. North of I-64 the highway is known as  16th Street . The highway's northern terminus is in downtown just south of the [[Ohio River]] at U.S. Route 60, near [[Marshall University]].

[[File:WV-101.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 101]]
'''WV 101''' is an unsigned highway which runs for less than a mile, connecting Third Avenue ([[US 60 (WV)|US 60]]) with [[Rotary Park]]. Until 1990, this was an alignment of US 60.

[[File:WV-106.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 106]]
'''WV 106''' enters the Huntington neighborhood of [[Guyandotte, Huntington, West Virginia|Guyandotte]], via the  [[East End Bridge (Huntington)|East End Bridge]] from [[Proctorville, Ohio|Proctorville]]. The highway crosses WV Route 2, and immediately terminates at U.S. Route 60, across the 3rd and 5th avenue split.

[[File:WV-152.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 152]]
'''WV 152''''s northern terminus is just shy of the city at [[Interstate 64 in West Virginia|Interstate 64]]. Continuing north changes to WV 527.

[[File:WV-527.svg|25px]] [[West Virginia Route 527]]
'''WV 527''' crosses south into Huntington from [[Chesapeake, Ohio]], via the [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]]. WV 527 then travels through downtown as 5th Street and exits the city at Interstate 64, which serves as the highway's southern terminus. Continuing south will lead into WV 152.

===Bridges===

The [[Robert C. Byrd Bridge]] is a {{convert|720|ft|adj=on}} [[continuous truss bridge|continuous truss]] automobile bridge that crosses the [[Ohio River]] between Huntington, West Virginia and [[Chesapeake, Ohio]]. The crossing was constructed to replace an old, narrow two lane structure that was demolished after 69 years of service in a spectacular implosion on July 17, 1995. The previous bridge, opened in 1926, was Huntington's first bridge across the Ohio River and was designed in a gothic style, complete with four two-ton spires that rested on top of each peak. The ground breaking ceremonies for the four-lane bridge was held on April 30, 1991.

The old 6th Street Bridge closed in the summer of 1993 to allow for the construction of the ramps and approaches in West Virginia and Ohio.<ref name="BOSM">"Bridge opening sparks memories." The Ironton Tribune. November 6, 1994.</ref> The new bridge was named the Robert C. Byrd Bridge under an executive order from former Governor [[Gaston Caperton]] to honor the U.S. senator from [[West Virginia]] who is credited with obtaining the funding for the project that was completed on November 6, 1994. The $32.6 million bridge was constructed with $1.4 coming from [[Ohio]], $5.6 coming from West Virginia, and $25.3 in federal funds. The famous spires, which once adorned the top of the former span, were saved. One is currently on display outside of the [[Chesapeake, Ohio|Chesapeake]] city hall at the intersection of [[State Route 7 (Ohio)|State Route 7]] and the Robert C. Byrd Bridge.<ref>"Bridge's old spire getting a new lease." Herald Dispatch. October 29, 1995.</ref> Two others are installed along 9th Street between 3rd and 5th Avenues.<ref>Chambers, Bryan.

The [[East Huntington Bridge]] (officially the "Frank Gatski Memorial Bridge," also called the "East End Bridge" or the "31st Street Bridge") is a {{convert|900|ft|adj=on}} [[cable-stayed bridge]] crossing the [[Ohio River]] at Huntington, West Virginia. It carries [[West Virginia Route 106|WV 106]] on the [[West Virginia]] approach and [[Ohio State Route 775|OH 775]] on the [[Ohio]] approach. The history of the span dates to the early 1970s when possible routings for a future [[Ohio River]] span were being discussed. To conform to the Huntington city comprehensive plan, the alignment preferred by the city was one that connected to [[Interstate 64]] outside of the city boundaries. Many favored a plan about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) north of the city along [[West Virginia Route 2|WV 2]].

Work began on the bridge in 1983 and was completed in August 1985 at a cost of $38 million. The designer of the bridge was Arvid Grant and Associated of [[Olympia, Washington]] and was the first bridge of its type in [[West Virginia]]. It was only the second of its kind in the United States since it utilized concrete instead of steel for its construction. It was built as a [[Federal Highway Administration|FHWA]] demonstration project. The [[Ohio River]] span and approach ramps on both sides of the river completed was what was known as Phase I. Future plans involved tolling the bridge and connecting it to [[U.S. Route 60 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 60]] four blocks east<ref>East Huntington Bridge. Rendering. 1971. West Virginia Department of Highways.</ref> The bridge was renamed for Marshall University's first member of the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], [[Frank Gatski|Frank "Gunner" Gatski]], during halftime of the Marshall-UTEP Football game on November 18, 2006.<ref>"Frank ‘Gunner’ Gatski Memorial Bridge to be dedicated at UTEP-Marshall game."

[[File:CSXHuntingtonDivisionHeadquarters.JPG|thumb|The former [[C&O Depot]], with the statue of [[Collis P. Huntington]] by [[Gutzon Borglum]] in the foreground.]] Since its founding as the western terminus of the C&O Railroad, Huntington has served as a major break of bulk point between rail traffic and the Ohio River/[[Mississippi River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]. The Huntington Division is still the largest in the [[CSX Transportation]] network. A large portion of the division's revenue comes from hauling coal out of the coalfields of [[West Virginia]] and Eastern [[Kentucky]]. Much of the coal is brought to the [[Port of Huntington-Tristate]] by train to be transported by river [[barge]]s to industrial centers in other parts of the United States.

Huntington is in the company's Southern Region and is the largest of ten operating divisions on the network. The division comprises the former railroads [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad|Chesapeake and Ohio]] (C&O); [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio]] (B&O); [[Western Maryland Railroad|Western Maryland]] (WM); [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad|Louisville and Nashville]] (L&N); and the Clinchfield. It serves the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio. CSX's Huntington Division main office is in the historical former C&O passenger station in downtown Huntington. The fine building is home to the division's top managers, a centralized yardmasters and train dispatchers center, a freight car light repair shop and a locomotive heavy repair facility in the city.<ref name="facebook" />

[[File:AmtrakHton.jpg|thumb|left|The platform area of the [[Huntington (Amtrak station)|Huntington Amtrak station]] as seen from the tracks.]]
The city was once a major hub for passenger rail service, but it now accounts for a significantly smaller portion of rail traffic than in the early decades of the 20th century.

The [[Amtrak]] station is on the [[Cardinal (train)|''Cardinal'']] line running three days a week (Wednesday, Friday, Sunday) between [[New York]] and [[Chicago]] via [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Charlottesville, VA]], [[Cincinnati]], and [[Indianapolis]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cardinal/Hoosier State|author=[[Amtrak]]|url=http://www.amtrak.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Amtrak/am2Route/Horizontal_Route_Page&c=am2Route&cid=1081256321680&ssid=134|accessdate=June 17, 2006}}</ref> The station at 1050 8th Avenue contains a waiting room and ticket office, as well as a platform on the south side of the east-west tracks, a small parking lot, and a small building in between.

The Amtrak station is six blocks south and two blocks west of the [[Tri-State Transit Authority]] Transit Center, where most TTA bus routes and Greyhound Buses stop. For closer connections, riders can take advantage of TTA Routes 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, which pass only two blocks away at 4th Avenue.

Those connections are not always practical under the current ''Cardinal'' schedule. The passengers arriving on the eastbound train, arriving from Chicago about 7:15&nbsp;a.m. can easily transfer to any route that serves the Transit Center. But few bus routes are running after the westbound train departs around 9:50&nbsp;p.m. Except for the few PM routes, most TTA routes stop running hours before the westbound train arrives, limiting options for any passengers who are either boarding or disembarking from the train.

===Public transit===
[[File:Huntington Trolley.jpg|thumb|right|Trolley bus No. 9 on Fourth Avenue]]
[[Tri-State Transit Authority]] (TTA) provides fixed-route bus service throughout Huntington and the surrounding area. Its buses range, on the [[West Virginia]] side from 19th Street West in Huntington to [[Milton, West Virginia]], about {{convert|20|mi|km}} to the east. On the [[Ohio]] side, the buses range from downtown Ironton to the Huntington suburb of [[Proctorville, Ohio]], which is also a range of about {{convert|20|mi|km}}. Interchange buses provide links between Huntington and [[Chesapeake, Ohio]], and between Ironton and [[Ashland, Kentucky]], where transfers are available to the [[Ashland Bus System]]. However the system does not interchange between the TTA and the City of Ashland Bus Service in [[Ceredo, West Virginia]].

The TTA also is involved in a [[joint venture]] with the [[Charleston, West Virginia]]-based [[Kanawha Valley Regional Transportation Authority]] bus system called [[Intelligent Transit]] which links downtown Huntington to Charleston via bus. All buses begin and end at the old [[Greyhound Bus]] Depot in downtown Huntington, which is now known as the TTA Center. Coordinates: {{tld|coord|38|25|18|N|82|26|14|W|display=inline,title}} TTA bus services<ref name=routes>{{cite web|url=http://www.tta-wv.com/routes_schedules.html|title=TTA routes and schedules|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref> operate on Monday to Saturday between 6:00&nbsp;a.m. and 11:15&nbsp;p.m.

===River===
[[File:OhioRiverHuntWVBCBB.jpg|left|thumb|The Ohio River looking upstream from the Robert C. Byrd Bridge]]
The [[Port of Huntington-Tristate]] is the largest inland port in the United States in terms of total tonnage and ton-miles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top twenty inland ports for 2003|author=Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/inlandport03f.pdf|accessdate=June 17, 2006}}</ref> This is due in large part to the coal traffic from the railroads and the [[petroleum]] products produced by the [[Marathon Petroleum Company]] [[oil refinery]] in nearby [[Catlettsburg, Kentucky]] that use the Port of Huntington/Tri-State to load their products onto barges.

===Air===
The public [[Tri-State Airport]], southwest of the city, has two runways. Commercial air service is provided by [[Allegiant Air]], [[Delta Connection]], and [[US Airways Express]].
