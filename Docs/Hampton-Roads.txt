'''Hampton Roads''' is the name of both a body of water in Virginia and the surrounding metropolitan region in Southeastern Virginia and Northeastern North Carolina, United States. Comprising the [[#Definitions|Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News, VA–NC]]  metropolitan area and an extended [[Combined Statistical Area]] that includes the [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina micropolitan area|Elizabeth City, NC Micropolitan Statistical Area]] and [[Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina|Kill Devil Hills, NC Micropolitan Statistical Area]], Hampton Roads is known for its large military presence, ice-free harbor, shipyards, [[coal pier]]s, and miles of waterfront property and beaches, all of which contribute to the diversity and stability of the region's economy.

The body of water known as Hampton Roads is one of the world's largest natural [[harbor]]s (more accurately a [[roadstead]] or "roads"). It incorporates the mouths of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], [[Nansemond River]], and [[James River]] with several smaller rivers and empties into the [[Chesapeake Bay]] near its mouth leading to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011</ref>{{discuss|Nansemond River vs Hampton Roads}}<ref>http://www.norfolkdevelopment.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=137&Itemid=69</ref>

The land area (also known as "[[Tidewater region|Tidewater]]"<ref name="autogenerated1" />) includes a collection of cities, counties and towns on the [[Virginia Peninsula]] and in [[South Hampton Roads]]. Some of the outlying areas further from the harbor may or may not be included as part of "Hampton Roads", depending upon the organization or usage. For example, as defined for federal economic purposes, the Hampton Roads metropolitan statistical area ([[Metropolitan Statistical Area|MSA]]) includes two counties in northeastern [[North Carolina]] and two counties in Virginia's [[Middle Peninsula]]. The Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News, VA–NC MSA has a population of over 1.7&nbsp;million, making it the 37th-largest metropolitan area in the United States.<ref>http://www.civiceconomics.com/html/rank_order.html</ref><ref>http://www.norfolkdevelopment.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=169:business-data&catid=60:business-data&Itemid=62</ref> The [[Combined Statistical Area]] includes four additional counties in North Carolina, pushing the regional population to over 1.8 million residents, the 32nd largest [[Combined Statistical Area|CSA]] in the country.

The area is steeped in 400 years of American history, with hundreds of historical sites and attractions that draw visitors from around the world each year. The harbor was the key to Hampton Roads' growth, both on land and in water-related activities and events. While the harbor and its tributaries were (and still are) important transportation conduits, at the same time they presented obstacles to land-based commerce and travel.

Creating and maintaining adequate infrastructure has long been a major challenge. The [[Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel]] (HRBT) and the [[Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel]] (MMMBT) are major harbor crossings of the [[Hampton Roads Beltway]] interstate, which links the large population centers of Hampton Roads. In 2007, the [[Hampton Roads Transportation Authority]] (HRTA) was formed under a controversial state law to levy various additional taxes, fees, and tolls to generate funding for major regional transportation projects, including a long-sought but costly third crossing of the harbor of Hampton Roads.

==Etymology==
The term "Hampton Roads" is a centuries-old designation that originated when the region was a struggling [[Kingdom of England|English]] outpost nearly four hundred years ago. The origin of the two words is noteworthy.

The word '''Hampton''' honors one of the founders of the [[Virginia Company of London]] and a great supporter of the colonization of Virginia, [[Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton]]. The early administrative center of the new colony was known as [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]], named for [[Elizabeth of Bohemia|Princess Elizabeth]], the daughter of King James I, and formally designated by the Virginia Company in 1619. The town at the center of Elizabeth Cittie became known as '''Hampton''', and a nearby waterway was designated Hampton Creek (also known as Hampton River).

Other references to the Earl include the area to the north across the bay (in what is now the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]]) which became known as [[Northampton County, Virginia|Northampton]], and an area south of the James River which became [[Southampton County, Virginia|Southampton]]. As with Hampton, both of these names remain in use today.

The term '''Roads''' (short for [[roadstead]]) indicates the safety of a port; as applied to a body of water, it is "a partly sheltered area of water near a shore in which vessels may ride at anchor".<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/roads Dictionary. com]</ref> Examples of other roadsteads are [[Castle Roads, Bermuda|Castle Roads]], in another of the [[London Company|Virginia Company's]] settlements, [[Bermuda]], and [[Lahaina Roads]], in Hawaii.

In 1755, the [[Virginia General Assembly]] recorded the name "Hampton Roads" as the channel linking the James, Elizabeth, and Nansemond rivers with the Chesapeake Bay.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://hamptonroads.com/2008/06/whats-name-hampton-roads What's in a name? Hampton Roads | HamptonRoads.com | PilotOnline.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Though it may be a misnomer, Hampton Roads has become known as the world's largest natural '''harbor''', in part because it is the northernmost major East Coast port of the United States which is ice-free year round. (This status is claimed with the notable exception of the extraordinarily cold winter of 1917, which was the entire U.S.'s coldest year on record.)

Over time, the entire region has come to be known as "Hampton Roads", a label more specific than its other moniker, "Tidewater Virginia", which could, by implication, include other areas of tidal land in eastern Virginia. The [[U.S. Postal Service]] changed the area's postmark from "Tidewater Virginia" to "Hampton Roads, Virginia" beginning in 1983.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

==Definitions==

===Counties and independent cities===
The U.S. Census Bureau defines the '''Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News, VA–NC MSA''' as 16 county-level jurisdictions—five counties and nine independent cities in Virginia, and two counties in North Carolina. While the borders of what locals call "Hampton Roads" may not perfectly align with the definition of the MSA, Hampton Roads is most often the name used for the metropolitan area.

'''Virginia Beach–Norfolk–Newport News, VA–NC MSA''' is a U.S. [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). According to the 2010 Census, its population is 1,676,822<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Census MSA Population Change Table|url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2010/cph-t/cph-t-2.html|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=July 7, 2013}}</ref> and the 2014 estimated population is 1,716,624.

''Since a state constitutional change in 1871, all cities in [[Virginia]] are [[independent city|independent cities]] and they are not legally located in a county. The [[Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] considers these independent cities to be [[county-equivalent]]s for the purpose of defining MSAs in Virginia. Each MSA is listed by its counties, then cities, in alphabetical order and not by size.''

* [[Gates County, NC|Gates County]]

===Evolution of Hampton Roads===
The Hampton Roads metropolitan area was first defined in 1950 as the '''Norfolk–Portsmouth Metropolitan Statistical Area'''. It comprised the independent cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth and [[South Norfolk, Virginia|South Norfolk]] and the counties of [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Princess Anne County|Princess Anne]]. In 1952, Virginia Beach separated from Princess Anne County.

In 1963, Virginia Beach and Princess Anne County merged, retaining the name Virginia Beach. The city was added to the MSA that year, while South Norfolk lost its metropolitan status. Also in 1963, Norfolk County and the City of South Norfolk merged to create the city of Chesapeake.

In 1973, Chesapeake and Currituck County were added to the MSA, while Virginia Beach became a primary city.

In 1983, the '''Newport News–Hampton Metropolitan Statistical Area''', comprising the cities of Newport News, Hampton, Poquoson, Suffolk and Williamsburg, and the counties of Gloucester, James City and York, was combined with the Norfolk–Virginia Beach–Portsmouth MSA and renamed the '''Norfolk–Virginia Beach–Newport News MSA'''.

In 1993, Isle of Wight, Mathews and Surry counties were added. Although Virginia Beach had passed Norfolk as the state's largest city by 1990, it was not made the first primary city of the MSA until 2010.

As a result of the 2010 Census, Gates County, North Carolina was added to the MSA, while [[Surry County, Virginia]] was removed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hampton Roads loses Surry Co., gains Gates Co., N.C.|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2013/03/hampton-roads-loses-surry-co-gains-gates-co-nc|accessdate=March 16, 2013}}</ref>

===Combined Statistical Area===
The Virginia Beach–Norfolk, VA–NC [[Combined Statistical Area]] additionally includes the [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina Micropolitan Statistical Area]], comprising:
* [[Pasquotank County, North Carolina|Pasquotank County]]
* {{flagicon|North Carolina}} [[Perquimans County, North Carolina|Perquimans County]]
* [[Camden County, North Carolina|Camden County]]

and the [[Kill Devil Hills, NC]] Micropolitan Statistical Area, comprising:
* [[Dare County, North Carolina|Dare County]]

As of the 2010 census, the total population of this [[Combined Statistical Area]] was 1,779,243, with a 2013 estimate of 1,810,266, a growth of 1.74%. It is currently the 32nd largest in the country and the 2nd largest in Virginia, after the Northern Virginia portion of the Washington, D.C.–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV MSA.

==History==
{{Main|History of Hampton Roads}}
[[File:Hampton Roads 1859.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The harbor area of Hampton Roads, from official state map of pre-civil war Virginia circa 1858. ''image from the Library of Virginia'']]

===17th–19th centuries===
The first colonists arrived in 1607 when English [[Christopher Newport|Captain Christopher Newport]] landed at [[Cape Henry]], today's City of Virginia Beach, an event now called the "First Landing." However, his party moved on, in search of a more defensible area upriver, mindful of competitors such as the Spanish, who had built a failed settlement on the Virginia Peninsula known as the [[Ajacán Mission]].

After exploring the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], they established the first successful English colony in the [[New World]] on [[Jamestown Island]] on May 14, 1607.<ref name="apva.org">http://www.apva.org/history/index.html Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities: ''Jamestown History''</ref> But the low, marshy site proved unhealthy and most of the colonists died, before a new Governor, [[Lord De La Warr]] (Delaware) arrived with [[John Rolfe]], who would establish the Virginia tobacco industry.<ref name="apva.org" />

The harbor and rivers of Hampton Roads were immediately recognised as prime locations for commerce, shipbuilding and military installations, with the fortifications at [[Old Point Comfort]] established as early as 1610, and [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard|Gosport Navy Yard]] (later Norfolk Naval Shipyard) in 1767. The decisive battle of the Revolution was won at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] in 1781, and the first naval action of the [[War of 1812]] took place in Hampton Roads, when a [[Royal Navy|Royal Naval]] vessel was seized by the American privateer ''Dash''. Later the entrance from Chesapeake Bay was equipped with new fortifications ([[Fort Monroe]] and [[Fort Wool]]), much of the building work being supervised by a young military engineer [[Robert E. Lee]].

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the historic [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] between the first American [[ironclad warship]]s, the {{USS|Monitor}} and the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']], took place off [[Sewell's Point]] in 1862. The battle was inconclusive, but Union forces later took control of Hampton Roads, Norfolk, and the lower James River, though they were thwarted from venturing further upstream by a strong Confederate battery at [[Drewry's Bluff]]. Also in 1862, Fort Monroe was the launching place for Union General [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]]'s [[Peninsula Campaign|massive advance]] up the Virginia Peninsula, which almost reached the Confederate capital [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], before the [[Seven Days Battles]] forced him back. In 1865, as the Confederacy was near collapse, President Abraham Lincoln met with three senior Confederates at Hampton Roads in an [[Hampton Roads Conference|unsuccessful bid]] for a negotiated peace.<ref>See [http://encyclopediavirginia.org/Hampton_Roads_Conference "Hampton Roads Conference" in ''Encyclopedia Virginia'']</ref>

Some former slaves had been [[Grand Contraband Camp|camped]] near Fort Monroe, where they were declared to be [[contraband (American Civil War)|Contraband of war]], instead of being returned to their former owners. The camp thus became the first self-contained African American community in the United States. [[Booker T. Washington]] was among the freedmen who attended the local school, which evolved into the present-day [[Hampton University]].

===20th century===
The [[Jamestown Exposition]] for the 300th anniversary of the 1607 founding of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] was held at [[Sewell's Point]] in a rural section of [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]] in 1907.

President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] arrived by water in the harbor of Hampton Roads, as did other notable persons such as [[Mark Twain]] and [[Henry H. Rogers|Henry Huttleston Rogers]], who both arrived aboard the latter's steam yacht ''[[Kanawha (1899)|Kanawha]]''. A major naval display was featured, and the U.S. [[Great White Fleet]] made an appearance. The leaders of the U.S. Navy apparently did not fail to note the ideal harbor conditions, as was later proved.

Beginning in 1917, as the United States became involved in World War I under President [[Woodrow Wilson]], formerly rural [[Sewell's Point]] became the site of what grew to become the largest Naval Base in the world which was established by the [[United States Navy]] and is now known as the [[Naval Station Norfolk]].

Twice in the 20th century, families of mostly African American heritage were displaced in entire communities when land along the northern side of the [[Virginia Peninsula|Peninsula]] primarily in [[York County, Virginia|York County]] west of Yorktown was taken in large tracts for military use during World War I and World War II, creating the present-day U.S. [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]], which includes Cheatham Annex, and a former [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]] base which became [[Camp Peary]].

Communities including [[Lackey, Virginia|"the Reservation"]], [[Halstead's Point, Virginia|Halstead's Point]], [[Penniman, Virginia|Penniman]], [[Bigler's Mill, Virginia|Bigler's Mill]], and [[Magruder, Virginia|Magruder]] were all [[Former counties, cities, and towns of Virginia|lost]] and absorbed into the large military bases.

Although some left the area entirely, many of the displaced families chose to relocate nearby to [[Grove, Virginia|Grove]], an unincorporated town in southeastern [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]] where many generations of some of those families now reside. From a population estimated at only 37 in 1895, Grove had grown to an estimated 1,100 families by the end of the 20th century. (To its north, Grove actually borders the Naval Weapons Station property and on its extreme east, a portion of the U.S. Army's land at [[Fort Eustis]] extends across Skiffe's Creek, although there is no direct access to either base).

===Colonial Williamsburg===
{{Main|Colonial Williamsburg}}
A dream of one Episcopalian priest to save his 18th-century church building was to expand to create the world's largest [[living museum]]. Replacing Jamestown at the end of the 17th century, [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] had been capital of the Colony and the new State of Virginia from 1699 to 1780. After the capital moved to Richmond in 1780, Williamsburg became a quieter and sometimes described as "sleepy" small town. It saw some action during the [[Battle of Williamsburg]] of the 1862 Peninsula Campaign during the Civil War. However, it was not located along any major waterway and did not have railroad access until 1881. Perhaps due to the secure inland location originally known as [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]], for Williamsburg, growth and great expansion of commerce in the 19th century did not occur as rapidly as in many other Virginia cities. The main activities were [[The College of William & Mary]] and [[Eastern State Hospital (Virginia)|Eastern State Hospital]], each historic institutions in their own right. In addition to the city's historic past, quite a few buildings of antiquity from the 18th century were still extant, although time was taking a toll by the early 20th century.

The Reverend Dr. [[W.A.R. Goodwin]] of [[Bruton Parish Church]] initially had wanted merely to save his historic church building. This he accomplished by 1907. He later served in [[Rochester, New York]] for many years. Upon returning to Williamsburg in 1923, he began to realize that many of the other colonial-era buildings also remained, but were in deteriorating condition, and their continued longevity was at risk.

Goodwin dreamed of a much larger restoration along the lines of what he had accomplished with his historic church. A cleric of modest means, he sought support and financing from a number of sources before successfully drawing the interests and major financial support of [[Standard Oil]] heir and philanthropist [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] and his wife [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]]. The result of their combined efforts was the creation of [[Colonial Williamsburg]], which included a restoration of the [[Wren Building]] at The College of William & Mary and a change of much of the downtown Williamsburg area into a {{convert|301|acre|km2|1|sing=on}} Historic Area of restored and replica buildings and surrounds to celebrate the patriots and the early history of America.

By the 1930s, Colonial Williamsburg had become the centerpiece of the [[Historic Triangle]] of Colonial Virginia. These were, of course, Jamestown, where the colony started, Williamsburg, and [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], where independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] was won. The three points were joined by the U.S. [[National Park Service]]'s [[Colonial Parkway]], a remarkable accomplishment built over a period of 27 years. The Historic Triangle area of the Hampton Roads region became one of the largest tourist attractions in the entire world.

In Dr. Goodwin's words: "Williamsburg is Jamestown continued, and Yorktown is Williamsburg vindicated."

===Other notable Hampton Roads "firsts"===
America's first free public schools, the Syms and Eaton free schools (later combined as [[Syms-Eaton Academy]]), were established in Hampton in 1634 and 1659 respectively. The Syms-Eaton Academy was later renamed Hampton Academy and in 1852 became part of the public school system, thus [[Hampton High School (Hampton, Virginia)|Hampton High School]] lays claim to being the oldest public school in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hampton Academy |year=2009 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/253776/Hampton-Academy}}</ref>  The trust fund created from the Syms and Eaton donations has remained intact since the 17th century and was incorporated into support for the Hampton public school system.<ref>{{cite web |title=Syms-Eaton Academy |year=2006 |url=http://historichamptonroads.com/syms_eaton_01.htm}}</ref>

In 1957, the [[Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel]] was the first [[bridge–tunnel]] complex in the world, to be followed by the area's much longer [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel]] in 1963. This was followed by the [[Monitor–Merrimac Memorial Bridge–Tunnel]] in 1992. The prevalence of bridge–tunnels in the area is due to the number of shipbuilding and naval bases in the area. Access to the open ocean from Norfolk Naval Shipyard (in Portsmouth), Naval Station Norfolk, Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek – Fort Story, and Newport News Shipbuilding (where all U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers have been built) do not pass under any bridges. Passing under bridges was considered a potential threat to the U.S. fleet.

In the 1960s, the first [[astronaut]]s of [[Project Mercury]] trained at the [[NASA]] facility adjacent to Hampton's [[Langley Air Force Base]]. Local features including [[Mercury Boulevard]] and a succession of astronaut-name bridges over the Hampton creek commemorate this fact.

==U.S. military==
The military has a large presence in the region. Area military facilities (alphabetically) include:
:* [[Camp Allen]], in Norfolk
:* [[Camp Peary]], in York County
:* [http://www.uscg.mil/d5/ Coast Guard 5th District], in Portsmouth
:* [[Training Center Yorktown|Coast Guard Training Center]], in York County

:* [[St. Julien's Creek Annex|Saint Julian's Creek Naval Depot Annex]], in Chesapeake

==Government==
The area consists of ten independent cities and seven counties. Each independent city has the powers and responsibilities of a county, including maintaining roads, courts, schools, and public safety. Some cities share these responsibilities with an adjoining county. [[Incorporated town]]s located within counties in Virginia do not operate independently.

The localities come together to consult on regional issues. Virginia defines regional planning districts by law. District members are usually independent cities and counties. Localities around the state may belong to more than one Planning District, as their constituents may have interests which cross over individual planning district boundaries.

The Hampton Roads Planning District Commission (HRPDC) currently includes 16 cities and counties in Virginia, and represents over 1.6&nbsp;million people.

The 16 jurisdictions include:
* the Cities of Chesapeake, Franklin, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, and Williamsburg,
* the Counties of Gloucester, Isle of Wight, James City, Southampton, Surry, and York

There are incorporated towns in three of the counties (Isle of Wight, Southampton and Surry) within the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrpdc.org/Membership.asp |title=Hampton Roads Planning District Commission Membership}}</ref>

The differences between the service area of the HRPDC and the federally defined metropolitan statistical area (MSA) are:
* Southampton County and the City of Franklin are not in the MSA.
* Mathews County is in the MSA but not the HRPDC.
* The MSA includes Currituck County, North Carolina, but the HRPDC does not.

The federal government has two major research laboratories in the area. NASA-Langley, on the northeast edge of Hampton near Poquoson, is the home of a variety of aeronautics research, including several one-of-a-kind wind tunnels. The Department of Energy's [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility]] (known as 'Jefferson Lab')<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jlab.org/|title=Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility}}</ref> conducts cutting edge physics research in [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]]; the lab hosts the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jlab.org/12GeV/|title=12 GeV Upgrade Technical Scope}}</ref> and a kilowatt-class [[free-electron laser]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jlab.org/FEL/|title=The FEL Program at Jefferson Lab}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Elizabeth River at NNSY.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of the Elizabeth River with Downtown Norfolk at top right. The carrier in the foreground is {{USS|Harry S. Truman|CVN-75}}.]]
The '''water area''' known as '''Hampton Roads''' is a wide channel through which the waters of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]], [[Nansemond River]], and [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] pass (between [[Old Point Comfort]] to the north and [[Sewell's Point]] to the south) into the [[Chesapeake Bay]] and the Atlantic Ocean.

The geology and topography of the Hampton Roads region is influenced by the [[Chesapeake Bay Impact Crater]] which is one of three factors contributing to the sinking of Hampton Roads at a rate between {{convert|15|and|23|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} per century.

The region has extensive natural areas, including {{convert|26|mi|km|0}} of Atlantic Ocean and Chesapeake Bay beaches, the [[Great Dismal Swamp]], picturesque rivers, state parks, wildlife refuges, and botanical gardens. Inland from the bay, the region includes [[Lake Drummond]], one of only two natural lakes found in Virginia, and miles of waterfront property along the various rivers and waterways. The region's native flora is consistent with that of the Southeast Coastal Plain and the lower Southeast Maritime Forest.

The '''land area''' which constitutes "Hampton Roads" varies depending upon perspective and purpose. Most of the land area of Hampton Roads is geographically divided into 2 smaller regions: the eastern portion of the [[Virginia Peninsula]] (the Peninsula) and [[South Hampton Roads]] (locally known as "the Southside"), which are separated by the harbor. When speaking of communities of Hampton Roads, virtually all sources (including the three discussed in the following paragraphs) include the seven major cities, two smaller ones, and three counties within those two subregions.

In addition, the [[Middle Peninsula]] counties of Gloucester and Mathews, while not part of the geographical Hampton Roads area, are included in the vast metropolitan region's population. Also, a small portion of northeastern North Carolina ([[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck County]]) is included in the region's statistics. Due to a peculiarity in the drawing of the Virginia-North Carolina border, [[Knott's Island, North Carolina|Knott's Island]] in that county is connected to Virginia by land, but is only accessible to other parts of North Carolina across waterways via a ferry system.

Each of the following current cities, counties and towns is included by at least one of the three organizations that define "Hampton Roads"

[[File:Welcome To HamptonVA.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Hampton is a Hampton Roads community.]]
The Hampton Roads area consists of nine independent cities (which are not part of any county).  [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]], [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]] cover the Southside of Hampton Roads while [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] reside on the Peninsula. [[Franklin, Virginia|Franklin]] borders Suffolk but the Census Bureau does not consider it as a part of the metro area.<ref name="whitehouse.gov">[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/bulletins/fy2007/b07-01.pdf]</ref>

The metro area has one county in North Carolina, [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck]]. The remaining counties, in Virginia, include [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight]] and [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry]] on the Southside, [[James City County, Virginia|James City]] and [[York County, Virginia|York]] on the Virginia Peninsula, and [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester]] and [[Mathews County, Virginia|Mathews]] on the Middle Peninsula. While [[Southampton County, Virginia|Southampton]] is adjacent to Surry, Isle of Wight, and the City of Suffolk, the Census Bureau does not consider it part of the metro area.<ref name="whitehouse.gov" />

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Hampton Roads}}
[[File:PortsmouthNorfolkFerry1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ferry Between Norfolk and Portsmouth]]
Historically, from the earliest times, the harbor was the key to the Hampton Roads area's growth, both on land and in water-related activities and events. Ironically, the harbor and its tributary waterways were (and still are) both important transportation conduits and obstacles to other land-based commerce and travel. Yet, the community leaders learned to overcome them.

In modern times, the region has faced increasing transportation challenges as it has become largely urbanized, with additional traffic needs. In the 21st century, the conflicts between traffic on vital waterways and land-based travel continue to present the area's leaders with extraordinary transportation challenges, both for additional capacity, and as the existing infrastructure, much of it originally built with [[toll road|toll revenues]], has aged without an adequate source of funding to repair or build replacements. The now-closed [[Kings Highway Bridge]] in [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]] and the [[Jordan Bridge]] closed by neighboring [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] in 2008 were each built in the 1920s. These were considered locally prime examples of this situation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Demolition set for Kings Highway Bridge; no replacement in sight|first=Aaron|last=Applegate|work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|date=March 23, 2007|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/240691}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=October 16, 2008|first=Mike |last=Saewitz|work=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|title=Jordan Bridge closure likely to cause longer backups|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/10/jordan-bridge-closure-likely-cause-longer-backups}}</ref>

In 2007, the new [[Hampton Roads Transportation Authority]] (HRTA) was formed under a controversial state law to levy various additional taxes to generate funding for major regional transportation projects, including a long-sought and costly additional crossing of the harbor of Hampton Roads (The Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel, Monitor-Merrimac Bridge Tunnel, and the James River Bridge are the existing crossings). As of March 2008, although its projects were considered to be needed, the agency's future was in some question while its controversial sources of funding were being reconsidered in light of a Virginia Supreme Court decision.<ref>O'Dell, Larry.

[[File:I-64 sign, Hampton Roads.jpg|thumbnail|I-64 on the Hampton Roads Beltway, north of I-264|right]]
The Hampton Roads area has an extensive network of [[Interstate Highway]]s, including the [[Interstate 64]], the major east-west route to and from the area, and its spurs and bypasses of [[Interstate 264 (Virginia)|I-264]], [[Interstate 464|I-464]], [[Interstate 564|I-564]], and [[Interstate 664|I-664]].

The [[Hampton Roads Beltway]] extends {{convert|56|mi|km|0}} on a long loop through the region, crossing the harbor on two toll-free [[bridge-tunnel]] facilities. These crossings are the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] between [[Phoebus, Virginia|Phoebus]] in Hampton and [[Willoughby Spit]] in Norfolk and the [[Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel]] between Newport News and Suffolk.
The Beltway connects with another Interstate highway and three arterial U.S. Highways at [[Bower's Hill, Virginia|Bower's Hill]] near the northeastern edge of the [[Great Dismal Swamp]]. Other major east-west routes are [[U.S. Route 58 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 58]], [[U.S. Route 60 in Virginia|U.S. Route 60]], and [[U.S. Route 460 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 460]]. The major north-south routes are [[U.S. Route 13 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 13]] and [[U.S. Route 17 (Virginia)|U.S. Route 17]].

There are also two other tunnels in the area, the [[Midtown Tunnel (Virginia)|Midtown Tunnel]], and the [[Downtown Tunnel]] joining Portsmouth and Norfolk, as well as the {{convert|17|mi|km|0|sing=on}}-long [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]], a toll facility which links the region with Virginia's [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]] which carries [[U.S. Route 13 (Virginia)|US 13]].<ref name =facts>{{cite web|title=Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel Facts|publisher=Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel Commission|url=http://www.cbbt.com/facts.html|accessdate=January 30, 2009}}</ref> The original Downtown Tunnel in conjunction with the [[Berkley Bridge (Virginia)|Berkley Bridge]] were considered a single bridge and tunnel complex when completed in 1952, perhaps stimulating the innovative [[bridge-tunnel]] design using [[man-made island]]s when the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel was planned, first opening in 1957. The [[George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge]] is a major [[toll bridge]] connecting U.S. Highway 17 on the [[Virginia Peninsula|Peninsula]] at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] with Virginia's [[Middle Peninsula]] region.

==Education==
[[File:DSU1.jpg|thumb|170px|left|The David Student Union at Christopher Newport University]]
Hampton Roads' individual cities and counties administer their own K-12 education for their localities. In addition to public education, area residents have many private and religious school options.

The area also has a number of higher education options for area residents. Some offer only associates and technical degrees and certificates, while others award advanced degrees, including doctorates. Some are publicly funded, but the region also has a number of private and for-profit colleges. Additionally, a number of universities have established satellite campuses in the region.

===Public universities===

[[File:hampton roads from space.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hampton Roads from space]]
Hampton Roads has become known as the "world's greatest natural harbor". The port is located only {{convert|18|mi|km|0}} from open ocean on one of the world's deepest, natural ice-free harbors. Since 1989, Hampton Roads has been the mid-Atlantic leader in U.S. waterborne foreign commerce and is ranked second nationally behind the Port of South Louisiana based on export tonnage. When import and export tonnage are combined, the Port of Hampton Roads ranks as the third largest port in the country (following the ports of New Orleans/South Louisiana and Houston). In 1996, Hampton Roads was ranked ninth among major U.S. ports in vessel port calls with approximately 2,700. In addition, this port is the U.S. leader in coal exports. The coal loading facilities in the Port of Hampton Roads are able to load in excess of 65 million tons annually, giving the port the largest, most efficient and modern coal loading facilities in the world.

It is little surprise therefore that the Hampton Roads region's economic base is largely port-related, including shipbuilding, ship repair, naval installations, cargo transfer and storage, and manufacturing related to the processing of imports and exports. Associated with the ports' military role are almost 50,000 federal civilian employees.

The harbor of Hampton Roads is an important highway of commerce, especially for the cities of [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], and [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]].

[[Huntington Ingalls Industries]] (formerly Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company), was created in 2008 as a spinoff of [[Northrop Grumman Newport News]] and is the world's largest [[shipyard]]. It is located a short distance up the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]]. In Portsmouth, a few miles up the Elizabeth River, the historic [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] is located. BAE Systems, formerly known as NORSHIPCO, operates from sites in the City of Norfolk. There are also several smaller shipyards, numerous docks and terminals.

[[File:Northrop Grumman Newport News 032007 015.png|thumb|200px|Huntington Ingalls' Newport News Shipbuilding]]
Massive [[coal pier]]s and loading facilities were established in the late 19th and early 20th century by the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O), [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (N&W), and [[Virginian Railway]] (VGN). The latter two were predecessors of the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], a [[Class I railroad]] which has its headquarters in Norfolk, and continues to export coal from a large facility at [[Lambert's Point]] on the Elizabeth River. [[CSX Transportation]] now serves the former C&O facility at Newport News. (The VGN's former coal facility at [[Sewell's Point]] has been gone since the 1960s, and the property is now part of the expansive [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk Navy Base]]).

===Federal impact===
Almost 80% of the region's economy is derived from federal sources. This includes the large military presence, but also NASA and facilities of the Departments of Energy, Transportation, Commerce and Veterans Affairs. The region also receives a substantial impact in government student loans and grants, university research grants, and federal aid to cities.

The Hampton Roads area has the largest concentration of military bases and facilities of any metropolitan area in the world. Nearly one-fourth of the nation’s active-duty military personnel are stationed in Hampton Roads, and 45% of the region's $81B gross regional output is Defense-related.<ref>http://www.hrp.org/Site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=67</ref><ref>http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/4564781</ref> All five military services' operating forces are there, as well as several major command headquarters: Hampton Roads is a chief rendezvous of the [[United States Navy]], and the area is home to the [[Allied Command Transformation]], which is the only major military command of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] ([[NATO]]) on U.S. soil. [[Langley Air Force Base]] is home to [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC). The [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk Navy Base]] is located at [[Sewell's Point]] near the mouth, on the site used for the tercentennial [[Jamestown Exposition]] in 1907. For a width of {{convert|500|ft|m|-1}} the Federal government during 1902 through 1905 increased its minimum depth at low water from {{convert|25.5|to|30|ft|m|0}}, and the channel has now been dredged to a depth of {{convert|55|ft|m|0}} in some places.

[[File:Langley research center.jpg|thumb|200px|NASA Langley Research Center]]
[[NASA]]'s [[Langley Research Center]], located on the Peninsula adjacent to [[Langley Air Force Base]] in Hampton, is home to scientific and aerospace technology research. The [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility]] (commonly known as Jefferson Labs) is located nearby in Newport News.

===Commercial growth===
The area's experiences with commercial and retail centers began early in 1918. Afton Square, located in the [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Cradock]] naval community of Portsmouth, was the first planned shopping center in the USA and has served as template for future developments throughout the nation.<ref>[http://www.portsmouthva.gov/planning/cradock.htm Cradock]</ref>

Hampton Roads experienced tremendous growth during and after World War II. In the 1950s, a trend in retail was the shopping center, a group of stores along a common sidewalk adjacent to off-street parking, usually in a suburban location.
[[File:LynnhavenOutdoor.JPG|thumb|200px|Lynnhaven Mall, opened in 1981, has {{convert|1400000|sqft|m2}} and 180 stores.]]
In 1959, one of the largest on the east coast of the USA was opened at the northeast corner of Military Highway and Virginia Beach Boulevard on property which had formally been used as an airfield. The new [[JANAF Shopping Center]], located in Norfolk, featured acres of free parking and dozens of stores. Backed by retired military personnel, the name JANAF was an acronym for Joint Army Navy Air Force.<ref>[http://www.janafshopping.com/aboutjanaf.php About JANAF Shopping Center]</ref>

During the 1950s and early 1960s, other shopping centers in Hampton Roads were developed, such as Wards Corner Shopping Center, Downtown Plaza Shopping Center and Southern Shopping Center in Norfolk; Mid-City Shopping Center in Portsmouth; Hilltop Shopping Center (now known as [[The Shops at Hilltop]]) in Virginia Beach; Riverdale Shopping Center in Hampton and the Warwick-Denbigh Shopping Center in Newport News.

In the late-1960s, a new type of shopping center came to Hampton Roads: the Indoor Shopping Mall. In 1965, South Hampton Roads broke ground on its first shopping mall in Virginia Beach, known as [[Pembroke Mall]]. The mall opened in 1966, and became Hampton Road's newest indoor shopping destination. The [[Virginia Peninsula]] had its first indoor shopping mall in 1973, with [[Coliseum Mall]]. Coliseum Mall drew so much traffic from [[Interstate 64]], that a towering [[overpass|flyover]] was built at the Mercury Boulevard and Coliseum Drive intersection, to accommodate eastbound mall traffic, from the Mercury Boulevard interchange. Coliseum Mall was demolished to make way for the open air mixed-use development [[Peninsula Town Center]]. Also in the 1970s, [[Tower Mall]] was built in Portsmouth, but was torn down and turned into the Victory Crossing shopping development. In Norfolk, [[Military Circle Mall]] on [[Military Highway]] was built across [[Virginia Beach Boulevard]] from the large JANAF Shopping Center with its own high-rise hotel right in the center. In 1981, [[Greenbrier Mall]] gave Chesapeake a shopping mall of its own as well, and Virginia Beach got the massive Lynnhaven Mall the same year.

[[Chesapeake Square Mall]] was constructed in Chesapeake, VA in 1989, near the border of Suffolk, Virginia, and has spawned a number of shopping centers in the surrounding areas. [[File:Macarthercenter.JPG|thumb|200px|MacArthur Center, opened in 1999, has {{convert|1100000|sqft|m2}} and 140 stores.]]
[[MacArthur Center]] opened in March 1999, which made downtown Norfolk a prime shoppers destination, with the region's first [[Nordstrom]] department store anchor. MacArthur Center is compared to other downtown malls, such as Baltimore's [[Harborplace]], Indianapolis' [[Circle Centre]] Mall, Atlanta's [[Lenox Square]] Mall and most comparably to [[Fashion Centre at Pentagon City|The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City]] near Washington, D.C., in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

Currently, Virginia Beach's [[Lynnhaven Mall]] is the region's largest shopping center with nearly 180 stores, and is one of the region's biggest tourist draws, with the [[Virginia Beach Oceanfront]], [[Colonial Williamsburg]], [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]]: The Old Country and MacArthur Center.

For a long time, the indoor shopping malls were seen as largely competitive with small shopping centers and traditional downtown type areas. However, in the 1990s and since, the "[[big-box]] stores" on the Peninsula and Southside, such as Wal-mart, Home Depot, and Target have been creating a new competitive atmosphere for the shopping malls of Hampton Roads.
[[File:Patrick Henry Mall sign, Hampton Roads, Virginia.jpg|thumb|200px|Patrick Henry Mall, opened in 1987, has {{convert|714310|sqft|m2}} and 120+ stores]]
Several older malls such as Pembroke and Military Circle have since their grand openings been renovated, and others have been closed and torn down. Newmarket North Mall is now [[NetCenter]], a business center (the Sears store remains). [[Coliseum Mall]], in Hampton, has been redeveloped as [[Peninsula Town Center]] in a new style, in step with the latest commercial real estate trend: the nationwide establishment of "[[Lifestyle center (retail)|lifestyle centers]]". Additional malls which have closed include [[Mercury Plaza Mall|Mercury Mall]] in Hampton (converted to Mercury Plaza Shopping Center in the mid-1980s, then completely torn down in 2001), and [[Tower Mall]] in Portsmouth (Built in the early 1970s, then torn down in 2001).

===America's first region===
In late 2006, the Hampton Roads Partnership, a non-profit organization representing 17 localities (ten cities, six counties, and one town), all local universities and major military commands as well as leading businesses in southeastern Virginia, commenced a campaign aimed at branding the land area of Hampton Roads as "America's First Region".

The new title is based on events in 1607 when English [[Christopher Newport|Captain Christopher Newport's]] three ships – the ''[[Susan Constant]]'', ''[[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]]'', and ''[[Discovery (1602 ship)|Discovery]]'' landed at [[Cape Henry]] along the Atlantic Coast in what is today Virginia Beach. After 18 days of exploring the area, the ships and their crews arrived at [[Jamestown Island]] where they established the first English speaking settlement to survive in the [[New World]] on May 14, 1607.

Because the region's east-west boundaries (now the City of Virginia Beach and James City County) have not changed since 1607, the Partnership felt justified in labeling Hampton Roads "America's First Region". It unveiled the new brand before 800 people at the annual meeting of the Hampton Roads Chamber of Commerce on December 13, 2006. A video shown that afternoon included endorsements from mayors and county board of supervisors chairs representing Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg and James City County as well as the [[Governor of Virginia]], [[Timothy Kaine]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrp.org/ |title=Hampton Roads Partnership}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}<!-- need direct statement, not advertising link -->

The mission of Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance (HREDA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to business attraction—marketing the Hampton Roads region as the preferred location for business investment and expansion. HREDA represents the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg and Franklin, as well as the counties of Gloucester, James City, Isle of Wight, York, and Southampton.<ref name="HREDA">http://www.hreda.com Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance</ref>

==Flag==
[[File:Flag of Hampton Roads, Virginia.svg|275px|right|thumb|Hampton Roads flag, adopted 1998]]
In 1998, a flag representing the Hampton Roads region was adopted. The design of the flag was created by a contest. The winner, sixteen-year-old Andrew J. Wall of [[Frank W. Cox High School]] in Virginia Beach, raised the new regional flag for the first time on the mast of a ship moored in the harbor.

As conceived by student Andrew Wall and embellished by the selection committee, his flag is highly symbolic:
:The ring of sixteen white stars stands for the cities and counties that comprise the region of Hampton Roads. The blue upper panel refers to the sea and sky, recalling the first European settlers at Jamestown in 1607, the first battle between ironclad ships in 1862, the importance of shipbuilding and ship repair in the area, as well as maritime commerce, fishing, recreational boating, and the major military and government installations around the area’s shores. Agriculture, the environment, tourism, industry, and a healthy quality of life are suggested by the lower panel of green. The wavy white central band with three crests suggests past, present, and future. The wave also recalls the surf and sand dunes of the area as seen from the sea. Water is the central theme. It touches all the components and binds them together.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/us-va-hr.html |title=Hampton Roads, Virginia (U.S.)|publisher=Flags of the World}}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Historic Triangle Virginia PNG.png|275px|right|thumb|Virginia's Historic Triangle]]
The area is most often associated with the larger [[American South]]. People who have grown up in the Hampton Roads area have a unique [[Tidewater accent]] which sounds different from a stereotypical [[Southern American English|Southern accent]]. Vowels have a longer pronunciation than in a regular southern accent.<ref name="Virginia Accents">{{cite web|url=http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/library/niceandcurious/manyvoices.htm |title=Virginia's Many Voices |accessdate=March 7, 2008 |publisher=Fairfax County Public Library |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080830052030/http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/library/niceandcurious/manyvoices.htm |archivedate=August 30, 2008 }}</ref>

===Attractions, museums and sites of interest===
There's also a wealth of other points of history to explore in the Hampton Roads area. Led by the Historic Triangle area, Hampton Roads consistently rates among the top tourism destinations in the world.

Cultural attractions include museums, historical sites, and venues from tiny to massively large for such things as art and musical shows. The region hosts two week-long visits by the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus]] each year with multiple performances at Norfolk Scope and the Hampton Coliseum, and even attracts a group of [http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/CircusTrain/ Circus Train Enthusiasts], [[railfan]]s who watch, photograph and report on the blue or red unit trains as they make their move between the two sites, requiring a long inland trip through [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] and [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in order to avoid crossing the {{convert|10|mi|km|adj=on}} geographical distance across the harbor (a trip impassable directly by modern trains; the two [[bridge-tunnel]] facilities operated by [[Virginia Department of Transportation|VDOT]] accommodate only highway traffic).

====Historic Triangle====
{{travel guide|date=April 2013}}
The [[Historic Triangle]] is located on the [[Virginia Peninsula]] and includes the colonial communities of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], and [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]], with many restored attractions linked by the [[Colonial Parkway]].

The [[National Park Service]]'s [[Colonial Parkway]] joins the three popular attractions of Colonial Virginia with a scenic and bucolic roadway carefully shielded from views of commercial development. This helps visitors mentally return to the past, and there are often views of [[wildlife]] and [[waterfowl]]. This two lane roadway is the best (but not quickest) way to move between the three points. Near the James River and [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] ends of the parkway, there are several pull-offs, where some families allow their children to feed bread to the seagulls. Commercial vehicles, except for tour buses, are prohibited.

For an even better experience, approach the area from the south by water from [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]] with a ride aboard one of the [[Jamestown Ferry]]s, which include the ''Pocahontas'' and ''Williamsburg''. As passengers cross, they can walk about the boat or go up to an enclosed viewing level with restrooms.<!--"restroom" is a common US euphemism for toilet. Please clarify meaning--><!--This is EXACTLY what is meant.--> Weather and daylight permitting, passengers usually see [[Jamestown Island]] much as the first colonists may have approached it. In fact, the replicas of [[Christopher Newport]]'s the three tiny ships, ''Susan Constant'', ''Godspeed'', and ''Discovery'' are docked near the northern ferry landing at [[Glass House Point]]. Both the Jamestown Ferry and Colonial Parkway are toll-free.

The first permanent English settlement in the New World which was established at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] in 1607. The 350th anniversary celebration at [[Jamestown Festival Park]] in 1957 was so popular, tourism has been continuously increasing ever since. The 400th anniversary was celebrated with an 18-month-long celebration called [[Jamestown 2007]].

Today, at Jamestown, you can visit recreations of an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] village and colonial fort, and archaeological sites where current work is underway by [[archaeologists]]s from the [[Jamestown Rediscovery]] project, with recently recovered archaeological artifacts in a new display building. Replicas of the three ships, ''[[Susan Constant]]'', ''[[Godspeed (ship)|Godspeed]]'', and ''[[Discovery (1602 ship)|Discovery]]'' are docked nearby.

The two major attractions, which are complementary to each other, are the state-sponsored '''[[Jamestown Settlement]]''' near the entrance to Jamestown Island, and the National Park Service's '''[[Historic Jamestowne]]''', on Jamestown Island itself.

In 1699, the first capital of Virginia was moved to [[Middle Plantation (Virginia)|Middle Plantation]] at the suggestion of students from the [[College of William & Mary]] (established 1693). It was soon renamed to [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], but became a largely forgotten little town after the capital was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] in 1780. Largely due to the 20th-century preservation efforts of the Reverend Dr. [[W.A.R. Goodwin]], rector of [[Bruton Parish Church]] and the generosity of [[Standard Oil]] heir [[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]], today [[Colonial Williamsburg]] is a large [[living museum]] of early American life. It has dozens of restored and recreated buildings and reenactors. It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. The Visitor's Center (right off the Colonial Parkway) features a short movie and is an excellent place to start (and leave automobiles, which are restricted from the restored area, where wheelchair-accessible shuttle [[bus]] service is provided).

[[Bassett Hall]], an 18th-century farmhouse, is located in Williamsburg just southeast of the Historic Area, was the Williamsburg home for over 25 years of the family of John D. Rockefeller Jr and his family from the mid-1930s until 1960, following over 7 years of restoration and expansions. The Rockefeller family bequeathed Bassett Hall to Colonial Williamsburg in 1979.<ref>[http://www.history.org/Almanack/places/hb/hbbass.cfm Completed two-year renovation in 2002]</ref> The home is now open to the public and appears much as it did in the 1930s and 1940s when the Rockefellers made it their home.<ref>[http://www.history.org/History/museums/bassett_hall.cfm 20th-century family home]</ref>

The third point of the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia is [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] where General Cornwallis surrendered to [[George Washington]] in 1781, ending the [[American Revolution]]. There are two large visitor centers, battlefield drives, and a waterfront area.

Notwithstanding the amazingly successful efforts to provide a non-commercial atmosphere at the three Historic Triangle areas (and on the Colonial Parkway between them), there are many hotels, motels, campgrounds, restaurants, shops and stores, gasoline stations, and amusements close by.
* [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] is a major theme park located near [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]].
* Williamsburg Pottery Factory is also nearby on [[U.S. Route 60 in Virginia|U.S. Route 60]], seven miles (11&nbsp;km) west of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] in [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]].

Hampton Roads has hosted many professional wrestling events throughout the years. The Norfolk Scope has served as the site of these events, including [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]'s [[Destination X]], [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s [[Starrcade]] and [[WCW World War 3|World War 3]], and [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF/WWE's]] [[The Great American Bash]] and the 2011 [[Slammy Awards]].<ref>http://www.profightdb.com/locations/united-states/virginia/norfolk/norfolk-scope-115.html</ref> Norfolk Scope was also the site of an infamous episode of [[WCW Monday Nitro]], where several members of the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] stable [[D-Generation X]] literally drove a tank to the entryway of the Scope, thus "invading" the competition.

Hampton Roads is {{convert|130|mi|km}} from the nearest major sports teams in Washington, D.C. and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. Another significant issue with the area as a sports market is internal transportation. The metropolitan area is split into two [[Virginia Peninsula|distinct]] [[South Hampton Roads|parts]] by its eponymous harbor; as of 2012, the harbor has only three widely separated road crossings (the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]], [[Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel]], and [[James River Bridge]]), each with two lanes of traffic in each direction. In addition, the area has two other major tunnels, plus several drawbridges on key highway corridors.

Hampton Roads previously hosted a [[Virginia Squires|successful franchise]] in the [[American Basketball Association]], although it was never a full-time home for that team. Its highest-ranking teams as of 2015 are the [[Norfolk Admirals (ECHL)|Norfolk Admirals]] of the [[ECHL]], and the [[Norfolk Tides]] of the [[International League|IL]]. Virginia is also the most populous state without a major team playing within its borders, though its northern reaches are served by the Washington clubs—two of which, the NHL's [[Washington Capitals|Capitals]] and NFL's [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]], have their operational headquarters and practice facilities in Virginia. Redskins owner [[Daniel Snyder]], through [[Red Zebra Broadcasting|a separate company]], owns two radio stations, [[WXTG (AM)|WXTG]] and [[WXTG-FM]], in the Norfolk market. The Hampton Roads television market is ranked [[List of TV markets and major sports teams in the United States|42nd]] in the U.S.
