'''County Cork''' ({{lang-ga|Contae Chorcaí}}) is the largest and southernmost [[Counties of Ireland|county]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Located in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]], it is named after the city of [[Cork (city)|Cork]] ({{lang-gle|Corcaigh}}). [[Cork County Council]] is the [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] for the county. Its largest towns are [[Cork City]], [[Carrigaline]], and [[Ballincollig]]. In 2011, the county's population was 518,128, making it the second [[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] of the Republic of Ireland's counties.<ref name="census 2011">[http://www.cso.ie/census/table1.htm Actual and percentage change in population 2006 and 2011 by Province county or city, Year, Statistic and Sex] Central Statistics Office. Retrieved: 25 February 2013.</ref>

==Local government and political subdivisions==
There are two [[Local government|local authorities]] whose remit collectively encompasses the geographic area of the county and city of Cork. The county, excluding [[Cork city]], is administered by [[Cork County Council]], while the city is administered separately by [[Cork City Council]]. Both city and county are part of the [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]]. For [[Eurostat|standardized European statistical purposes]] both Cork County Council and Cork City Council rank equally as first-level [[local administrative unit]]s of the [[NUTS 3 statistical regions of the Republic of Ireland|NUTS 3]] [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Region]]. There are 34 such [[NUTS of the Republic of Ireland#Local administrative units|LAU 1]] entities in the Republic of Ireland.

Each [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] is responsible for certain local [[Public services|services]] within its jurisdiction, such as [[sanitation]], [[planning]] and [[Real estate development|development]], [[library|libraries]], the collection of [[automobile|motor]] [[tax]]ation, local [[road]]s and [[social housing]].

For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the county is divided into five constituencies—[[Cork East (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Cork East]], [[Cork North–Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Cork North–Central]], [[Cork North–West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Cork North–West]], [[Cork South–Central (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Cork South–Central]] and [[Cork South–West (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Cork South–West]]. Together they return 19 deputies ([[Teachta Dála|TDs]]) to the Dáil.  The county is part of the [[South (European Parliament constituency)|South]] constituency for the purposes of [[Elections in the European Union|European elections]].

For purposes other than local government, such as the formation of sporting teams, the term "County Cork" is often taken to include both city and county.

==Geography and political subdivisions==
County Cork is located in the [[Provinces of Ireland|province]] of [[Munster]]. It borders four other counties: [[County Kerry|Kerry]] to the west, [[County Limerick|Limerick]] to the north, [[County Tipperary|Tipperary]] to the north-east and [[County Waterford|Waterford]] to the east. Cork is the [[List of Irish counties by area|largest county]] in the state by land area. The population of Cork city stood at 119,230 in 2011. The population of County Cork is 519,032, making it the state's second [[List of Irish counties by population|most populous]] county and the fourth-most populous county on the island of [[Ireland]]. The remit of Cork County Council includes some suburbs of the city not within the area of Cork City Council.

=== Baronies ===
{{see also|List of baronies of Ireland}}
There are 24 historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in the county—the most of any county in [[List of baronies of Ireland|Ireland]]. While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they are no longer used for many administrative purposes. Their official status is illustrated by Placenames Orders made since 2003, where official Irish names of baronies are listed.

There are 253 civil parishes in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logainm.ie/Viewer.aspx?text=Cork&streets=no |title=Placenames Database of Ireland. Retrieved January 21, 2012 |publisher=Logainm.ie |date=13 December 2010 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref>

Townlands are the smallest officially defined geographical divisions in Ireland; there are approximately 5447 townlands in the county.

===Mountains and upland habitats===
[[File:Pulleen Strand - geograph.org.uk - 457493.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Pulleen Strand, Bera]]
The county's main mountain ranges include: the [[Slieve Miskish Mountains|Slieve Miskish]] and [[Caha Mountains]] on the [[Beara Peninsula]], the [[Ballyhoura Mountains]] on the border with Limerick and the [[Shehy Mountains]] which contain [[Knockboy]] (706 m) the highest point in Cork. The [[Shehy Mountains]] are on the border with Kerry and may be accessed from the area known as Priests Leap, near the village of Coomhola. The [[Galtee Mountains]] are located across parts of Tipperary, Limerick and Cork and are Ireland's highest inland mountain range. The upland areas of the [[Ballyhoura Mountains|Ballyhoura]], [[Boggeragh Mountains|Boggeragh]], [[Derrynasaggart Mountains|Derrynasaggart]] and the [[Mullaghareirk Mountains|Mullaghareirk Mountain]] ranges add to the range of habitats found in the county. Important habitats in the uplands include blanket bog, heath, glacial lakes and upland grasslands. Cork has the [[List of Irish counties by highest point|13th highest]] county peak in Ireland.

===Rivers and lakes===
The three great rivers: the [[River Bandon|Bandon]], the [[Munster Blackwater|Blackwater]] and the [[River Lee (Ireland)|Lee]], and their valleys dominate central Cork. Habitats of the valleys and floodplains include woodlands, marshes, fens and species-rich limestone grasslands. The river Bandon flows through many towns including [[Dunmanway]] in the west to the town of [[Bandon, County Cork|Bandon]] before draining into Kinsale Harbour on Ireland's south coast. Cork has two well-known sea loughs, [[Lough Hyne]] and [[Lough Mahon]], and also contains many small lakes. An area has formed where the River Lee breaks into a network of channels weaving through a series of wooded islands. There are 85 hectares of swamp around Cork's wooded area. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) carried out a survey of surface waters in County Cork between 1995 and 1997 which identified 125 rivers and 32 lakes covered by the regulations.

===Coastline===
[[File:Mizen head ireland.png|thumbnail|right|[[Mizen Head]]: the most south-westerly point of both Cork and Ireland.]]
{{See also|List of islands of Ireland}}
Cork has a mountainous and flat landscape with many beaches and sea cliffs along its coast. The southwest of Ireland is known for its peninsulas and some in Cork include the [[Beara Peninsula]], [[Sheep's Head]], [[Mizen Head]] and [[Brow Head]]. Brow Head is the most southerly point of mainland [[Ireland]]. There are many islands off the coast of the county, in particular off [[West Cork]]. [[Carbery's Hundred Isles]] are the islands around Long Island Bay and Roaringwater Bay. [[Fastnet Rock]] lies in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] 11.3&nbsp;km south of mainland Ireland, making it the most southerly point of [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. Many notable islands lie off Cork, including [[Bere Island|Bere]], [[Great Island|Great]], [[Sherkin Island|Sherkin]] and [[Cape Clear Island|Cape Clear]]. Cork has 1,094&nbsp;km of coastline, the second-longest coastline of any county after [[County Mayo|Mayo]], which has 1,168&nbsp;km.

===Land and forestry===
Like many parts of [[Munster]], Cork has rich fertile agricultural land and many bog and peatlands. Cork has approximately 74,000 hectares of peatlands, which amounts to 9.8% of the county's total land area. And the county contains approximately {{convert|79188|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of forest and woodland area, or 10.5% of Corks land area, higher than the national average of 9%.

===Wildlife===
The [[hooded crow]], ''corvus cornix'' is a common bird, particularly in areas nearer the coast. Due to this bird's ability to (rarely) prey upon small lambs, the gun clubs of Cork County have killed a large number of these birds in modern times.<ref>C. Michael Hogan. 2009. [http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_information.asp?thingid=26307 ''Hooded Crow: Corvus cornix'', GlobalTwitcher.com, ed, N. Stromberg]</ref> A collection of the marine [[algae]] is housed in the [[Herbarium]] of the [[botany]] department of the [[University College Cork]].<ref name="Cullinane 73">Cullinane, J.P. 1973 ''Phycology of the South Coast of Ireland.'' University College Cork</ref> Parts of the South West coastline are hotspots for sightings of rare birds, with Cape Clear being a prime location for bird watching. The island is also home to one of only a few gannet colonies around Ireland and the UK. A major attraction to the coastline of Cork is whale watching, with sightings of fin whales, basking sharks, pilot whales, minke whales, and other species being frequent.

The county is colloquially referred to as "The Rebel County". This name has 15th Century origins, but from the 20th century the name has been more commonly attributed to the prominent role Cork played in the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921) when it was the scene of considerable fighting. In addition, it was an anti-treaty stronghold during the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922–23). Much of what is now county Cork was once part of the [[Kingdom of Desmond|Kingdom of ''Deas Mumhan'']] (South [[Munster]]), anglicised as [[Kingdom of Desmond|"Desmond"]], ruled by the [[MacCarthy dynasty|MacCarthy Mór dynasty]]. After the [[Norman Ireland|Norman Invasion]] in the 12th century, the McCarthy clan were pushed westward into what is now West Cork and [[County Kerry]]. [[Dunlough Castle]], standing just north of [[Mizen Head]], is one of the oldest castles in Ireland (A.D. 1207). The north and east of Cork were taken by the [[Hiberno-Norman]] [[FitzGerald dynasty]], who became the [[Earl of Desmond|Earls of Desmond]]. Cork City was given an English Royal Charter in 1318 and for many centuries was an outpost for [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] culture. The Fitzgerald Desmond dynasty was destroyed in the [[Desmond Rebellions]] of 1569–1573 and 1579–83. Much of county Cork was devastated in the fighting, particularly in the [[Second Desmond Rebellion]]. In the aftermath, much of Cork was colonised by English settlers in the [[Plantations of Ireland|Plantation of Munster]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 1491 Cork played a part in the English [[Wars of the Roses]] when [[Perkin Warbeck]], a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow [[Henry VII of England]]. The Cork people fought with Perkin because he was French and not English, they were the only county in Ireland to join the fight. The mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed. Cork's nickname of the 'rebel city' originates in these events.

In 1601 the decisive [[Siege of Kinsale|Battle of Kinsale]] took place in County Cork, which was to lead to English domination of Ireland for centuries. Kinsale had been the scene of a landing of Spanish troops to help Irish rebels in the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]] (1594–1603). When this force was defeated, the rebel hopes for victory in the war were all but ended. County Cork was officially created by a division of the older [[Kingdom of Desmond|County Desmond]] in 1606.

In the 19th century, Cork was a centre for the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|Fenians]] and for the constitutional [[Irish nationalism|nationalism]] of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], from 1910 that of the [[All-for-Ireland League|All-for-Ireland Party]]. The county was a hotbed of guerrilla activity during the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921). Three Cork Brigades of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] operated in the county and another in the city. Prominent actions included the [[Kilmichael Ambush]] in November 1920 and the [[Crossbarry Ambush]] in March 1921. The activity of IRA [[flying column]]s, such as the one under [[Tom Barry (soldier)|Tom Barry]] in west Cork, was popularised in the [[Ken Loach]] film ''[[The Wind That Shakes the Barley (film)|The Wind That Shakes The Barley]]''. On 11 December 1920 [[The Burning of Cork|Cork City centre was gutted by fires]] started by the [[Black and Tans]] in reprisal for IRA attacks. Over 300 buildings were destroyed, many other towns and villages around the county suffered a similar fate including [[Fermoy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebelcork.com/ |title=Rebelcork.com |publisher=Rebelcork.com |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}</ref>

During the [[Irish Civil War]] (1922–23), most of the IRA units in Cork sided against the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. From July to August 1922 they held the city and county as part of the so-called [[Munster Republic]]. However, Cork was taken by troops of the [[Irish Free State]] in August 1922 in the [[Irish Free State offensive]], that included both overland and seaborne attacks. For the remainder of the war, the county saw sporadic guerrilla fighting until the Anti-Treaty side called a ceasefire and dumped their arms in May 1923. [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], a key figure in the War of Independence, was born near [[Clonakilty]] and assassinated during the civil war in [[Béal na Bláth]], both in west Cork.

==Irish language==
