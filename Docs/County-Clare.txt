===Physical geography===
[[File:Cliffs of Moher, Ireland (8577753321).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cliffs of Moher]]]]
Bodies of water define much of the physical boundaries of Clare. To the southeast is the [[River Shannon]], Ireland's longest river, and to the south is the [[Shannon Estuary]]. The border to the northeast is defined by [[Lough Derg (Shannon)|Lough Derg]] which is the third largest lake on Ireland. To the west is the Atlantic Ocean, and to the north is [[Galway Bay]].

County Clare contains [[The Burren]], a unique [[karst]] region, which contains rare flowers and fauna.  At the western edge of The Burren, facing the Atlantic Ocean, are the [[Cliffs of Moher]]. The highest point in County Clare is [[Moylussa]], 532m, in the [[Slieve Bernagh]]<ref>NB: not related to the [[Slieve Bearnagh]] mountain in County Down.</ref> range in the east of the county.
The following islands lie off the coast of the county:
*[[Aughinish, County Clare|Aughinish]]
*[[Inishmore (or Deer) Island]]
*[[Inishloe]]
*[[Mutton Island]]
*[[Scattery Island]]

==History==
[[File:Poulnabrone dolmen-SteveFE.jpg|thumb|left|[[Poulnabrone dolmen]] in [[The Burren]].]]
There was a [[Neolithic]] civilisation in the Clare area — the name of the peoples is unknown, but the [[Bronze Age Europe|Prehistoric]] peoples left evidence behind in the form of ancient [[dolmen]]; single-chamber [[megalithic tomb]]s, usually consisting of three or more [[megalith|upright stones]]. Clare is one of the richest places for these tombs in Ireland, the most noted is in [[The Burren]] area, it is known as [[Poulnabrone dolmen]] which translates as the ''hole of sorrows''.<ref name="clareneolithic">{{cite web |title=Neolithic Sites in Ireland |url=http://www.myguideireland.com/neolithic-sites-in-ireland |publisher=MyGuideIreland.com}} Retrieved on 2 October 2008.</ref> The remains of the people inside the tomb have been excavated and dated to 3800 BC.<ref name="clareneolithic"/> [[Ptolemy]] created a map of Ireland in his ''[[Geographia]]'' with information dating from 100 AD, it is the oldest written account of the island with geographical features.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ptolemy's map of Ireland: a modern decoding |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a791562641~db=all~jumptype=rss |publisher=InformAWorld.com}} Retrieved on 2 October 2008.</ref> Within his map Ptolemy names the [[Celtic tribes|Gaelic tribes]] inhabiting it and the areas in which they resided; in the area of Clare he identified a tribe known as the ''Gangani''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Arrival of the Celts |url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/pre_norman_history/iron_age.html |publisher=WesleyJohnston.com}} Retrieved on 2 October 2008.</ref> Historians have found the tribes on the west of Ireland hardest to identify with known peoples, however [[William Camden|Camden]] and [[Charles O'Conor (historian)|O'Conor]] speculated a possible connection between the Gangani and the ''Concani'',<ref>O'Laughlin, ''The Families of County Clare, Ireland'', 7.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Before there were Counties |url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~irlkik/ihm/irehstry.htm |publisher=RootsWeb.com}} Retrieved on 2 October 2008.</ref><ref>[[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]], ''"The Annals of Ireland by the Four Masters" as translated by Owen Connellan.'', 393.</ref> one of the eleven tribes in the confederacy of the [[Cantabri]] in the northern part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].<ref>Anthon, ''A Classical Dictionary'', 368.</ref>

[[File:Tau Cross, Roughan Hill, Corofin, County Clare, Ireland.jpg|thumb|The [[Cross of Tau|Tau Cross]] at Roughan Hill near [[Corofin, County Clare|Corofin]], County Clare, Ireland]]
During the [[Early Middle Ages]] the area was part of the [[Connacht|Kingdom of Connacht]] ruled by the [[Uí Fiachrach Aidhne]], until it was annexed to the [[Kingdom of Munster]] to be settled by the [[Dalcassian]]s in the mid-10th century. It was renamed Thomond, meaning North Munster and spawned [[Brian Boru]] during this period, perhaps the most noted [[High King of Ireland]]. From 1118 onwards the [[Kingdom of Thomond]] was in place as its own petty kingdom, ruled by the [[O'Brien Clan]]. After the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]], [[Thomas de Clare, Lord of Thomond|Thomas de Clare]] established a short-lived Norman lordship of Thomond, extinguished at the [[Battle of Dysert O'Dea]] in 1318 during [[Bruce campaign in Ireland|Edward Bruce's invasion]]. The county name ''Clare'' probably comes not from the de Clare family, but from the settlement of Clare (now [[Clarecastle]]) whose Irish name {{lang|ga|''Clár''}} ["plank bridge"] refers to a crossing over the [[River Fergus]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Briggs |first=Keith |year=2009 |title=Clare, Clere, and Clères |journal=Journal of the English Place-name Society |issue=41 |page=14 |url=http://ww.keithbriggs.info/documents/clare_03.pdf#page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irishcultureandcustoms.com/ACounty/Clare.html |title=Origin of the name "Clare" |publisher=Irishcultureandcustoms.com |date= |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.from-ireland.net/county/article/Emigration-%26-Education-Statistics,-1931,-Co.-Clare/Clare |title=Thom's Directory, 1931 |publisher=From-ireland.net |date= |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>

In 1543, during the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland]], [[Murrough O'Brien, 1st Earl of Thomond|Murrough O'Brien]] by [[surrender and regrant]] to [[Henry VIII]] became [[Earl of Thomond]] within Henry's [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. [[Henry Sidney]] as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]] responded the [[Desmond Rebellion]] by creating the [[Lord President of Connaught|presidency of Connaught]] in 1569 and [[Lord President of Munster|presidency of Munster]] in 1570. He transferred Thomond from Munster to Connaught, which he shired, Thomond becoming County Clare. About 1600 Clare was removed from the presidency of Connaught and made a presidency in its own right under the Earl of Thomond. When [[Henry O'Brien, 5th Earl of Thomond]] died in 1639, Lord Deputy [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]] decreed Clare should return to the presidency of Munster, but the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] delayed this until [[Restoration (England)|the Restoration]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Falkiner |first=Caesar Litton |title=The Counties of Ireland: An Historical Sketch of Their Origin, Constitution, and Gradual Delimitation (1902-1904) |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy.

Clare's [[List of Irish county nicknames|county nickname]] is the ''Banner County'', for which various origins have been suggested: the banners captured by [[Clare's Dragoons]] at the [[Battle of Ramillies]]; or the banner of "[[Catholic emancipation]]" raised by [[Daniel O'Connell]]'s victory in [[Clare by-election, 1828|an 1828 by-election for County Clare]] that led to the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]].<ref name="Spellissy2003">{{cite book |last=Spellissy |first=Sean |title=A History of County Clare |date=1 January 2003 |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |isbn=9780717134601 |page=39}}</ref>

[[Scattery Island]], in the [[Mouth of the Shannon]] off the Clare coast, was transferred to [[Limerick Corporation]] and the [[county of the city]] of Limerick after the [[dissolution of the monasteries]], and assigned to County Clare after the [[Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840]]. Under the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]], part of the judicial county of Galway (Drummaan, Inishcaltra North and Mountshannon electoral divisions) was transferred to county Clare.  This area contains the village of [[Mountshannon]] on the north-western shore of [[Lough Derg (Shannon)|Lough Derg]].

==Local government and Dáil Éireann representation==
{{See also|Clare (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Clare County Council}}

The county seat is at Ennis, which also serves as a major regional hub for County Clare. Among its emergency services, it contains the Ennis Regional Hospital, the HQ of the Clare Divisional Garda, the Clare Fire Brigade and Civil Defence.

[[Clare (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Clare]] is represented by its own [[parliamentary constituency]] in [[Dáil Éireann]], the lower house of the Irish parliament or [[Oireachtas]] and has since 1921. Clare is currently served by four [[Teachta Dála|TD]]s. Briefly a small area of Clare was in the [[Clare–Galway South (Dáil Éireann constituency)|Clare–Galway South]] constituency during the 1970s before its [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974|abolition]]. The second tier of [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local governance]] is represented by the [[Town Councils in the Republic of Ireland|town councils]]—Clare has four in the form of [[Ennis]], [[Kilrush]], [[Kilkee]] and [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannon]].

The constituency has historically been a [[Fianna Fáil]] stronghold. However [[Fianna Fáil]] lost its overall majority on the council in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2004/0615/1086274489602.html |title='A very bad performance' - Ahern |author=Mark Hennessy and Michael O'Regan |date=15 June 2004 |work=The Irish Times |accessdate=20 February 2008}}</ref>  As of the [[Irish local elections, 2009|2009 local elections]] [[Fine Gael]] is the largest party with 12 seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electionsireland.org/results/local/council.cfm?election=2009L&area=245 |title=2009 Local Elections - Electoral Area Details |publisher=Elections Ireland |date= |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> It won 40% of the vote in the Clare constituency in the [[Irish general election, 2011|2011 Irish general election]].

Ennis in County Clare is also the birthplace of Grammy-nominated songstress [[Maura O'Connell]] whose grandmother started a fish market in the town. The county has many traditional music festivals and one of the most well known is the [[Willie Clancy Summer School]], which is held every July in the town of [[Milltown Malbay]] in memory of the renowned [[uilleann]] piper, [[Willie Clancy (musician)|Willie Clancy]].

[[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]] has written two songs celebrating County Clare: one is "West Coast of Clare" (recorded with [[Planxty]] in 1973), in which he mentions [[Spanish Point, County Clare|Spanish Point]] and Milltown Malbay. The other is "My Heart's Tonight In Ireland" (recorded on his solo album ''[[Rain on the Roof (Andy Irvine album)|Rain on the Roof]]'' in 1996, and again on ''[[Changing Trains]]'' in 2005), in which he mentions several towns and villages in County Clare: Milltown Malbay, [[Scariff]], [[Kilrush]], [[Sixmilebridge]], Kilkishin, [[Lahinch]], [[Ennistymon]], [[Liscannor]] and [[Kilkee]], and also makes two references to the music of Willie Clancy:
<blockquote><poem>In the town of Scarriff the sun was shining in the sky
When Willie Clancy played his pipes and the tears welled in my eyes
Many years have passed and gone since the time we had there
But my heart's tonight in Ireland in the sweet County Clare.
...
Lahinch and Ennistymon, Liscannor and Kilkee
But best of all was Milltown when the music flowed so free
Willie Clancy and the County Clare I'm ever in your debt
For the sights and sounds of yesterday are shining memories yet.</poem></blockquote>

Milltown Malbay is home to Oidhreacht an Chlair, an institute for higher education in all aspects of Irish tradition, history and literature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.ie/site/ |title=Oidhreacht an Chláir Teo |publisher=Oac.ie |date= |accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref>

Clare is served by two [[national primary road]]s—a classification referring to the major routes between major urban centres [[roads in Ireland|in Ireland]].<ref name="roads">{{cite web |url=http://www.nra.ie/Publications/DownloadableDocumentation/GeneralPublications/file,15886,en.pdf |title=National Route: Lengths as of 2007 |accessdate=25 December 2008 |publisher=National Roads Authority}}</ref> This includes the [[N18 road (Ireland)|N18]] connecting [[Limerick]] to [[Galway]], which passes through Ennis and by route of the [[N19 road (Ireland)|N19]]—Shannon.<ref name="roads" /> These two roads are part of the wider Western and Southern Corridor connecting many of the major settlements right across the island in these areas. There are also some significant [[national secondary road]]s—across the coast, stretching from [[Ballyvaughan]], through [[Ennistymon]] and [[Kilkee]], before arriving at [[Kilrush]] is the [[N67 road (Ireland)|N67]].<ref name="roads" /> In addition to this the [[N68 road (Ireland)|N68]] connects Kilrush to Ennis, while Ennis is connected to Ennistymon via the [[N85 road (Ireland)|N85]].<ref name="roads" />

Mainland public transport is mostly limited to buses ran by [[Irish Government]] owned company [[Bus Éireann]]; there are around 25 buses running frequent routes which pass through the majority of large settlements in Clare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.carlberry.co.uk/rfnlistr.asp?C=CLAI&op=B |title=Bus services for County Clare Council |accessdate=25 December 2008 |publisher=CarlBerry.co.uk}}</ref> The [[Ennis railway station]] operated by government owned [[Iarnród Éireann]] is the most significant railway station in Clare today; it was opened on 2 July 1859.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ennis station |work=Railscot - Irish Railways |url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf |accessdate=25 December 2008}}</ref> By route of [[Limerick]] the trains run from Ennis to [[Dublin Heuston railway station|Dublin]] and it generally takes 3 hours to complete the journey.<ref>{{cite web |title=Details of train travel between Dublin and Ennis |publisher=CarlBerry.co.uk |url=http://www.carlberry.co.uk/rfnshowr.asp?RE=IR006A |accessdate=25 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Your Journey - Timetables |publisher=[[Irish Rail]] |url=http://www.irishrail.ie/your_journey/timetables_junction1.asp |accessdate=25 December 2008}}</ref> There was previously a far more extensive local railway network in Clare, laid while part of the United Kingdom, the [[West Clare Railway]] was in existence from its opening in 1887 by [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] until 1961 covering much of the county.<ref>{{cite web |title=A Short History Of The West Clare Railway |publisher=WestClareRailway.ie |url=http://www.westclarerailway.ie/wcrhistory.html |accessdate=25 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080104172904/http://www.westclarerailway.ie:80/wcrhistory.html |archivedate=4 January 2008}}</ref> It was quite inefficient however, leading [[Percy French]] to write the song ''[[Are Ye Right There Michael|Are Ye Right There Michael?]]'' about his experience. Much of it was dug up and dismantled by the Irish government from the 1950s—1970s after being deemed uneconomic, however there remains local [[advocacy group]]s who wish to conserve and restore parts of it.<ref>{{cite web |title=The West Clare Railway Co |publisher=WestClareRailway.ie |url=http://www.westclarerailway.ie/wcrproject.html |accessdate=25 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20080104172925/http://www.westclarerailway.ie:80/wcrproject.html |archivedate=4 January 2008}}</ref>
