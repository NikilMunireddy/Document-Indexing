'''Indiana''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Indiana.ogg|ɪ|n|d|i|ˈ|æ|n|ə}} is a [[U.S. state]] located in the [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] and [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes]] regions of North America. Indiana is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|38th largest by area]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|16th most populous]] of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|50 United States]].  Its capital and largest city is [[Indianapolis]]. Indiana was admitted to the United States as the 19th U.S. state on December 11, 1816.

Before becoming a territory, varying cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] and historic [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] inhabited Indiana for thousands of years. Since its founding as a territory, settlement patterns in Indiana have reflected regional cultural segmentation present in the Eastern United States; the state's northernmost tier was settled primarily by people from New England and New York, Central Indiana by migrants from the Mid-Atlantic states and from adjacent Ohio, and Southern Indiana by settlers from the Southern states, particularly Kentucky and Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/286017/Indiana/279873/Settlement-patterns-and-demographic-trends|title=Indiana – Settlement patterns and demographic trends|publisher=eb.com|author1=William Vincent D'Antonio |author2=Robert L.

S. Bureau of Economic Analysis|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}</ref> Indiana has several metropolitan areas with populations greater than 100,000 and a number of smaller industrial cities and towns. Indiana is home to several major sports teams and athletic events including the [[National Football League|NFL]]'s [[Indianapolis Colts]], the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Indiana Pacers]], the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA's]] [[Indiana Fever]], the [[Indianapolis 500]], and [[Brickyard 400]] [[motorsports]] [[auto racing|races]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Indiana schild.jpg|thumb|State sign, [[Interstate 65]]]]
The state's name means "Land of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]", or simply "Indian Land".<ref>An earlier use of the name dates to the 1760s, when it referenced a tract of land under control of the Commonwealth of Virginia, but the area's name was discarded when it became a part of that state. See {{cite journal | last= Hodgin | first= Cyrus | year=1903| title= The Naming of Indiana |journal= Papers of the Wayne County, Indiana, Historical Society| volume=1| issue=1 | pages=3–11| publisher=Wayne County, Indiana, Historical Society| location= | format =pdf transcription| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2805.htm| accessdate =January 23, 2014}}</ref> It also stems from Indiana's territorial history. On May 7, 1800, the [[United States Congress]] passed legislation to divide the [[Northwest Territory]] into two areas and named the western section the [[Indiana Territory]]. In 1816, when Congress passed an Enabling Act to begin the process of establishing statehood for Indiana, a part of this territorial land became the geographic area for the new state.<ref>A portion of the Northwest Territory's eastern section became the state of [[Ohio]] in 1803. The [[Michigan Territory]] was established in 1805 from part of the Indiana Territory's northern lands and four years later, in 1809, the Illinois counties were separated from the Indiana Territory to create the [[Illinois Territory]].

A resident of Indiana is known as a [[Hoosier]]. The etymology of this word is disputed, but the leading theory, as advanced by the Indiana Historical Bureau and the Indiana Historical Society, has "Hoosier" originating from Virginia, the Carolinas, and Tennessee (a part of the upland South region of the United States) as a term for a backwoodsman, a rough countryman, or a country bumpkin.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Haller |first=Steve |date=Fall 2008 |title=The Meanings of Hoosier: 175 Years and Counting |journal=Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=5 and 6   | publisher=[[Indiana Historical Society]] |location=[[Indianapolis]] |issn=1040-788X | url =http://www.indianahistory.org/our-collections/reference/Hoosier.pdf| accessdate =January 23, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The Word Hoosier | author=Graf, Jeffery | publisher=Indiana University – Bloomington | url=http://www.indiana.edu/~librcsd/internet/extra/hoosier.html | accessdate=February 27, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Indiana}}
{{See also|Outline of Indiana#History}}

===Aboriginal inhabitants===
The first inhabitants in what is now Indiana were  the [[Paleo-Indians]], who arrived about 8000&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|BC]] after the melting of the glaciers at the end of the [[Ice Age]]. Divided into small groups, the Paleo-Indians were [[nomad]]s who hunted large [[Game (food)|game]] such as [[mastodons]]. They created stone tools made out of [[chert]] by chipping, [[knapping]] and [[Lithic reduction|flaking]].<ref name="HIS">{{cite web| title =Prehistoric Indians of Indiana| publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://in.gov/dnr/historic/files/prehisindians.pdf| accessdate =July 5, 2009 }}</ref> The [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic period]], which began between 5000 and 4000 BC, covered the next phase of indigenous culture. The people developed new tools as well as techniques to cook food, an important step in civilization. Such new tools included different types of spear points and knives, with various forms of [[Arrow#Nocks|notches]]. They made ground-stone tools such as stone axes, woodworking tools and grinding stones. During the latter part of the period, they built earthwork [[mound]]s and [[midden]]s, which showed that settlements were becoming more permanent. The Archaic period ended at about 1500 BC, although some Archaic people lived until 700 BC.<ref name="HIS"/> Afterward, the [[Woodland period]] took place in Indiana, where various new cultural attributes appeared. During this period, the people created ceramics and pottery, and extended their cultivation of plants. An early Woodland period group named the [[Adena culture|Adena people]] had elegant burial rituals, featuring log tombs beneath earth mounds. In the middle portion of the Woodland period, the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell people]] began developing long-range trade of [[Good (economics)|goods]]. Nearing the end of the stage, the people developed highly productive cultivation and adaptation of agriculture, growing such crops as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. The Woodland period ended around 1000 AD.<ref name="HIS"/> The [[Mississippian culture]] emerged, lasting from 1000 until the 15th century, shortly before the arrival of Europeans. During this stage, the people created large urban settlements designed according to their cosmology, with large mounds and plazas defining ceremonial and public spaces. The concentrated settlements depended on the agricultural surpluses. One such complex was the [[Angel Mounds]]. They had large public areas such as plazas and platform mounds, where leaders lived or conducted rituals. Mississippian civilization collapsed in Indiana during the mid-15th century for reasons that remain unclear.<ref name="HIS"/> The historic Native American tribes in the area at the time of European encounter spoke different languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] family. They included the [[Shawnee]], [[Miami people|Miami]], and [[Illiniwek|Illini]]. Later they were joined by refugee tribes from eastern regions including the Delaware who settled in the White and Whitewater River Valleys.

===European exploration and sovereignty===
In 1679 the French explorer [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was the first European to cross into Indiana after reaching present-day [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] at the [[St. Joseph River (Lake Michigan)|Saint Joseph River]].<ref>Allison, p. 17.</ref> He returned the following year to learn about the region. French-Canadian [[fur trade]]rs soon arrived, bringing blankets, jewelry, tools, whiskey and weapons to trade for skins with the Native Americans. By 1702, [[Louis Juchereau de St. Denis|Sieur Juchereau]] established the first trading post near [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]]. In 1715, [[Jean Baptiste Bissot, Sieur de Vincennes|Sieur de Vincennes]] built [[Fort Miami (Indiana)|Fort Miami]] at [[Kekionga]], now [[Fort Wayne]]. In 1717, another Canadian, [[Picote de Beletre]], built [[Fort Ouiatenon]] on the [[Wabash River]], to try to control Native American trade routes from [[Lake Erie]] to the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1732, Sieur de Vincennes built a second fur trading post at Vincennes. French Canadian settlers, who had left the earlier post because of hostilities, returned in larger numbers. In a period of a few years, British colonists arrived from the East and contended against the Canadians for control of the lucrative fur trade. Fighting between the French and British colonists occurred throughout the 1750s as a result.

The Native American tribes of Indiana sided with the French Canadians during the [[French and Indian War]] (also known as the [[Seven Years' War]]). With British victory in 1763, the French were forced to cede all their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River and north and west of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] to the British crown.

The tribes in Indiana did not give up; they destroyed [[Fort Ouiatenon]] and [[Forts of Fort Wayne, Indiana#Fort Miami|Fort Miami]] during [[Pontiac's Rebellion]]. The British royal proclamation of 1763 designated the land west of the Appalachians for Indian use, and excluded British colonists from the area, which the Crown called Indian Territory. In 1775, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began as the colonists sought more self-government and independence from the British. The majority of the fighting took place near the East Coast, but the Patriot military officer [[George Rogers Clark]] called for an army to help fight the British in the west.<ref>Brill, p. 31–32.</ref> Clark's army won significant battles and took over [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] and [[Fort Sackville]] on February 25, 1779.<ref name="NO">{{cite web| title =Northwest Ordinance of 1787 | publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2695.htm#events| accessdate =July 24, 2009 }}</ref> During the war, Clark managed to cut off British troops, who were attacking the eastern colonists from the west. His success is often credited for changing the course of the American Revolutionary War.<ref>Brill, p. 33.</ref> At the end of the war, through the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the British crown ceded their claims to the land south of the Great Lakes to the newly formed United States, including American Indian lands.

===The frontier===
In 1787, the US defined present-day Indiana as part of its [[Northwest Territory]]. In 1800, Congress separated [[Ohio]] from the Northwest Territory, designating the rest of the land as the [[Indiana Territory]].<ref name="GAC"/> President [[Thomas Jefferson]] chose [[William Henry Harrison]] as the governor of the territory and [[Vincennes, Indiana|Vincennes]] was established as the capital.<ref>Brill, p. 35.</ref> After [[Michigan Territory]] was separated and the [[Illinois Territory]] was formed, Indiana was reduced to its current size and geography.<ref name="GAC">{{cite web| title =Government at Crossroads: An Indiana chronology|work=[[The Herald Bulletin]]| date =January 5, 2008| url =http://www.heraldbulletin.com/news/local_news/government-at-crossroads-an-indiana-chronology/article_3a07aa44-1cd4-5028-82e7-96b907121b31.html?mode=jqm| accessdate =July 22, 2009 }}</ref>
[[Image:Indiana Indian treaties.svg|150px|right|thumb|Map showing extent of the treaty lands.]]

Starting with the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794 and [[Treaty of Greenville]], 1795, Indian titles to Indiana lands were extinguished by usurpation, purchase, or war and treaty.  About half the state was acquired in the St. Mary's Purchase from the Miami in 1818.  Purchases weren't complete until the [[Treaty of Mississinwas]] in 1826 acquired the last of the reserved Indian lands in the northeast.

A portrait of the Indiana frontier about 1810: The frontier was defined by the treaty of Fort Wayne in 1809, adding much of southwestern lands around Vincinnes and southeastern lands adjacent to Cincinnati, to areas along the Ohio River as part of U.S. territory.  Settlements were military outposts, Fort Ouiatenon in the northwest and Fort Miami (later Fort Wayne) in the northeast, Fort Knox and Vincinnes settlement on the lower Wabash, Clarksville (across from Louisville), Vevay, and Corydon along the Ohio River, the Quaker Colony in Richmond on the eastern border, and Conner's Post (later Connersville) on the east central frontier. Indianapolis wouldn't be a populated place for 15 more years, and central and northern Indiana Territory remained savage wilderness.  Indian presence was waning, but still a threat to settlement.  Only two counties, Clark and Dearborn in the extreme southeast, had been organized.  Land titles issued out of Cincinnati were sparse.  Migration was chiefly by flatboat on the Ohio River westerly, and wagon trails up the Wabash/White River Valleys (west) and Whitewater River Valleys (east).

In 1810, the [[Shawnee]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] [[Tecumseh]] and his brother [[Tenskwatawa]] encouraged other tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]]; the US gained victory at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]] on November 7, 1811. Tecumseh was killed in 1813&nbsp;during the [[Battle of Thames]]. After his death, armed resistance to United States control ended in the region. Most Native American tribes in the state were later [[Indian removals in Indiana|removed]] to west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the 1820s and 1830s after US negotiations and purchase of their lands.<ref>Brill, pp. 36–37.</ref>

===Statehood and settlement===
In order to decrease the threat of Indian raids following the Battle of Tippecanoe, [[Corydon, Indiana|Corydon]], a town in the far southern part of Indiana, was named the second capital of the Indiana Territory in May 1813.<ref name="GAC"/> Two years later, a petition for statehood was approved by the territorial general assembly and sent to Congress. An [[Enabling Act]] was passed to provide an election of delegates to write a [[constitution of Indiana|constitution for Indiana]]. On June 10, 1816, delegates assembled at Corydon to write the constitution, which was completed in 19 days. President [[James Madison]] approved Indiana's [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|admission into the union]] as the nineteenth state on December 11, 1816.<ref name="NO"/> In 1825, the state capital was moved from Corydon to [[Indianapolis]].<ref name="GAC"/>

Many European [[immigrants]] went west to settle in Indiana in the early 19th century. The largest immigrant group to settle in Indiana were [[German-American|Germans]], as well as numerous immigrants from Ireland and England. Americans who were primarily [[English American|ethnically English]] migrated from the Northern Tier of New York and New England, as well as the mid-Atlantic state of Pennsylvania.<ref name="The History of Indiana">{{cite web| title =The History of Indiana| publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]| url =http://www.history.com/topics/us-states/indiana| accessdate =July 26, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:WJGw9z2RkkYJ:www.uen.org/Lessonplan/downloadFile.cgi%3Ffile%3D1041-6-15955-AF_Census_Data.pdf%26filename%3DAF_Census_Data.pdf+49,598,035&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgyigzsjZP7yBWdThzodFWP_t7GiFtOGi5W12qTf5nLj_yFzQ0YIKJn2pSyS1TIT-ZjvBx0s057h5mpwrf39HOZmlg3VzoOdaoPrNTdS6x-0SbHnwGXfzVLkDYTyIg7k4E_Zsn8&sig=AHIEtbTzro9GQY6LB1-9ZG9n2r46Epyyaw Data on selected ancestry groups.]</ref>  The arrival of steamboats on the Ohio River in 1811, and the [[National Road]] at Richmond in 1829 greatly facilitated settlement of northern and western Indiana.

Following statehood, the new government worked to transform Indiana from a [[American frontier|frontier]] into a developed, well-populated, and thriving state, beginning significant demographic and economic changes. The state's founders initiated a program, Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act, that led to the construction of roads, [[canal]]s, railroads and state-funded public schools. The plans bankrupted the state and were a financial disaster, but increased land and produce value more than fourfold.<ref>{{cite web| last =Vanderstel| first =David G| title =The 1851 Indiana Constitution by David G. Vanderstel| publisher=State of Indiana| url =http://www.in.gov/history/2689.htm| accessdate =July 24, 2009 }}</ref> In response to the crisis and in order to avert another, in 1851, a second constitution was adopted.  Among its provisions were a prohibition on public debt and extension of suffrage to African-Americans.

===Civil War===
{{Main|Indiana in the American Civil War}}
During the [[American Civil War]], Indiana became politically influential and played an important role in the affairs of the nation. As the first western state to mobilize for the United States in the war, Indiana had soldiers participating in all of the major engagements. The state provided 126&nbsp;infantry regiments, 26&nbsp;batteries of artillery and 13&nbsp;regiments of cavalry to the cause of the Union.<ref>Funk, pp. 23–24, 163.</ref> In 1861, Indiana was assigned a quota of 7,500&nbsp;men to join the Union Army.<ref>Gray 1995, p. 156.</ref> So many volunteered in the first call that thousands had to be turned away. Before the war ended, Indiana contributed 208,367&nbsp;men to fight and serve in the war. Casualties were over 35% among these men: 24,416&nbsp;lost their lives in the conflict and over 50,000&nbsp;more were wounded.<ref>Funk, pp. 3–4.</ref> The only Civil War battle fought in Indiana was the [[Battle of Corydon]], which occurred during [[Morgan's Raid]]. The battle left 15&nbsp;dead, 40&nbsp;wounded, and 355&nbsp;captured.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Civil War; a Narrative, Red River to Appomattox|author=Foote, Shelby|publisher=Random House|year=1974|pages =343–344}}</ref>
{{missing information|Civil War legacy and late 19th century industry|date=January 2015}}
Indiana remained a largely agricultural state; post-war industries included food processing, such as milling grain, distilling it into alcohol, and meatpacking; building of wagons, buggies, farm machinery, and hardware.

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Midnight at the glassworks2b.jpg|left|thumb|Child laborers in glassworks, by [[Lewis Hine]]. Indiana, August 1908.]]
With the onset of the industrial revolution, Indiana industry began to grow at an accelerated rate across the northern part of the state. With industrialization, workers developed labor unions and suffrage movements arose in relation to the progress of women.<ref>Gray 1995, p. 202.</ref> The [[Indiana Gas Boom]] led to rapid industrialization during the late 19th&nbsp;century by providing cheap fuel to the region.<ref>Gray 1995, p. 13.</ref> In the early 20th century, Indiana developed into a strong [[Rust Belt|manufacturing state]] with ties to the new auto industry.<ref name="The History of Indiana"/> [[Haynes-Apperson]], the nation's first commercially successful auto company, operated in [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]] until 1925. The construction of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] and the start of auto-related industries were also related to the auto industry boom.<ref>Brill, p. 47.</ref>

During the 1930s, Indiana, like the rest of the nation, was affected by the [[Great Depression]]. The economic downturn had a wide-ranging negative impact on Indiana, such as the decline of urbanization. The [[Dust Bowl]] further to the west resulted in many migrants fleeing into the more industrialized Midwest. Governor [[Paul V. McNutt]]'s administration struggled to build a state-funded welfare system to help the overwhelmed private charities. During his administration, spending and taxes were both cut drastically in response to the Depression, and the state government was completely reorganized.

===Modern era===
With the conclusion of World War II, Indiana rebounded to levels of production before the Great Depression. Industry became the primary employer, a trend that continued into the 1960s. Urbanization during the 1950s and 1960s led to substantial growth in the state's cities. The auto, steel and pharmaceutical industries topped Indiana's major businesses. Indiana's population continued to grow during the years after the war, exceeding five million by the 1970&nbsp;census.<ref>{{cite book|title=Economic Geography|author1=Haynes, Kingsley E.  |author2=Machunda, Zachary B|year=1987|pages =319–333}}</ref> In the 1960s, the administration of [[Matthew E.

Beginning in 1970, a series of amendments to the state constitution were proposed. With adoption, the [[Indiana Court of Appeals]] was created and the procedure of appointing justices on the courts was adjusted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/supreme/2366.htm|title=History and Origins|author=Indiana Historical Bureau| publisher=Indiana Historical Bureau|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

The [[1973 oil crisis]] created a recession that hurt the automotive industry in Indiana. Companies such as [[Delco Electronics]] and [[Delphi (auto parts)|Delphi]] began a long series of downsizing that contributed to high unemployment rates in manufacturing in [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]], and [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]]. The restructuring and deindustrialization trend continued until the 1980s, when the national and state economy began to diversify and recover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1992/02/art2full.pdf|title=Auto industry jobs in the 1980s: a decade of transition|last=Singleton|first=Christopher J.|publisher=United States Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=July 28, 2009}}</ref>

The state includes two natural regions of the United States, the Central Lowlands and the [[Interior Low Plateaus]].<ref>Logan, Cumings, Malott, Visher, Tucker & Reeves, p. 70</ref> The [[till plain]]s make up the northern and central allotment of Indiana. Much of its appearance is a result of elements left behind by glaciers. Central Indiana is mainly flat with some low rolling hills (except where rivers cut deep valleys through the plain, like at the Wabash River and Sugar Creek) and soil composed of glacial sands, gravel and clay, which results in exceptional farmland.<ref name="FW"/> Northern Indiana is also very similar except for the presence of higher and hillier [[terminal moraine]]s and many [[kettle lake]]s in some regions. In [[northwest Indiana]], there are various sand ridges and dunes, some reaching near 200 feet in height. These are located along the Lake Michigan shoreline and also inland to the [[Kankakee Outwash Plain|Kankakee River Valley]]. The unglaciated southern segment of the state carries a different and off-balance surface, characterized in places by profound valleys and rugged, hilly terrain much different from the rest of the state. Here, bedrock is exposed at the surface and isn't buried in glacial till like further north. Because of the prevalent limestone, there are numerous caves in the area. The soil is fertile in the valleys of southern Indiana.

{{Main|Time in Indiana}}
Indiana is one of thirteen U.S. states that are divided into more than one time zone. Indiana's [[time zone]]s have fluctuated over the past century. At present most of the state observes [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]; six counties near Chicago and six near Evansville observe [[Central Time Zone (North America)|Central Time]]. Debate continues on the matter.

Before 2006, most of Indiana did not observe [[daylight saving time]] (DST). Some counties within this area, particularly [[Floyd County, Indiana|Floyd]], [[Clark County, Indiana|Clark]], and [[Harrison County, Indiana|Harrison]] counties near [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and [[Ohio County, Indiana|Ohio]] and [[Dearborn County, Indiana|Dearborn]] counties near [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, unofficially observed DST by local custom. Since April 2006 the entire state observes DST.

After serving for two years, the judges must acquire the support of the electorate to serve for a 10-year term.<ref name="ST"/> In nearly all cases, the Supreme Court does not have [[original jurisdiction]] and can only hear cases that are petitioned to the court following being heard in lower courts. Local circuit courts are where the majority of cases begin with a trial and the consequence decided by the jury. The Supreme Court does have original and sole jurisdiction in certain specific areas including the practice of law, discipline or disbarment of Judges appointed to the lower state courts, and supervision over the exercise of jurisdiction by the other lower courts of the State.<ref name="Fur">{{cite web| title =Indiana Constitution Article 7| date =February 25, 1999| publisher=Indiana University| url =http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/inconst/art-7.html|accessdate =August 3, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/supreme/appellate.html |title=Appellate Process |publisher=State of Indiana |date=February 4, 2009 |accessdate=August 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20090723101408/http://www.in.gov/judiciary/supreme/appellate.html |archivedate=July 23, 2009 }}</ref>

The state is divided into 92&nbsp;[[County (United States)|counties]], which are led by a board of county commissioners. 90 counties in Indiana have their own [[circuit court]] with a judge elected for a six-year term. The remaining two counties, Dearborn and Ohio, are combined into one circuit. Many counties operate [[superior court]]s in addition to the circuit court. In densely populated counties where the caseload is traditionally greater, separate courts have been established to solely hear either juvenile, criminal, probate or small claims cases. The establishment, frequency and jurisdiction of these additional courts varies greatly from county to county. There are 85 city and town courts in Indiana municipalities, created by local ordinance, typically handling minor offenses and not considered [[courts of record]]. County officials that are elected to four-year terms include an auditor, recorder, treasurer, sheriff, coroner and clerk of the circuit court. All incorporated cities in Indiana have a mayor and council form of municipal government. Towns are governed by a town council and townships are governed by a township trustee and advisory board.<ref name="ST"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/judiciary/2674.htm|title=Indiana Trial Courts: Types of Courts|publisher=State of Indiana|accessdate=May 4, 2014}}</ref>

While only five Democratic presidential nominees have carried Indiana since 1900, 11 Democrats [[List of Governors of Indiana|were elected governor]] during that time. Before [[Mitch Daniels]] became governor in 2005, Democrats had held the office for 16&nbsp;consecutive years. Indiana elects two senators and nine representatives to Congress. The state has 11&nbsp;electoral votes in presidential elections.<ref name="Atlas"/> Seven of the [[Indiana's congressional districts|districts]] favor the Republican Party according to the CPVI rankings; there are currently seven Republicans serving as representatives and two Democrats. Historically, Republicans have been strongest in the eastern and central portions of the state, while Democrats have been strongest in the northwestern part of the state. Occasionally, certain counties in the southern part of the state will vote Democratic. Marion County, Indiana's most populous county, supported the Republican candidates from 1968 to 2000, before backing the Democrats in the 2004, 2008, and 2012, elections. Indiana's second most populous county, Lake County, strongly supports the Democratic party and has not voted for a Republican since 1972.<ref name="Atlas">{{cite web | title=Presidential General Election Map Comparison | publisher=uselectionatlas.org | url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/comparemaps.php?year=2008&fips=18&f=1&off=0&elect=0 | accessdate=August 11, 2009}}</ref> In 2005, the Bay Area Center for Voting Research rated the most liberal and conservative cities in the United States on voting statistics in the 2004&nbsp;presidential election, based on 237&nbsp;cities with populations of more than 100,000.

===Military installations===
Indiana is home to several current and former military installations.  The largest of these is the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division]], located approximately 25 miles southwest of [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], which is the third largest naval installation in the world, comprising approximately 108 square miles of territory.

Other active installations include [[Air National Guard]] fighter units at [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]], and [[Terre Haute]] airports (to be consolidated at Fort Wayne under the [[Base Realignment and Closure, 2005|2005 BRAC proposal]], with the Terre Haute facility remaining open as a non-flying installation). The [[Army National Guard]] conducts operations at [[Camp Atterbury]] in [[Edinburgh, Indiana]], helicopter operations out of [[Shelbyville, Indiana|Shelbyville]] Airport and urban training at [[Muscatatuck Urban Training Center]]. The Army's [[Newport Chemical Depot]], which is now closed and turning into a coal purifier plant. Also, [[Heslar Naval Armory|Naval Operational Support Center Indianapolis]] is home to several [[United States Navy Reserve|Navy Reserve]] units, two [[Marine Forces Reserve|Marine Reserve]] units, and a small contingent of active and full-time-support reserve personnel.

Indiana used to be home to two major military installations, [[Grissom Air Force Base]] near Peru (realigned to an [[Air Force Reserve]] installation in 1994) and [[Fort Benjamin Harrison]] near Indianapolis, now closed, though the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] continues to operate a large finance center there ([[Defense Finance and Accounting Service]]).

In 2000, Indiana had a work force of 3,084,100.<ref>{{cite web| title =Economic Base| publisher=City of Valparaiso| url =http://ci.valparaiso.in.us/documentcenter/view/281| accessdate =November 2, 2009 }}</ref> The total gross state product in 2010 was $275.7&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=GDP by State|url=http://greyhill.com/gdp-by-state|publisher=Greyhill Advisors|accessdate=September 7, 2011}}</ref> A high percentage of Indiana's income is from manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Economy at a Glance | publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics | url=http://stats.bls.gov/eag/eag.in.htm | accessdate=January 11, 2007}}</ref> The Calumet region of [[northwest Indiana]] is the largest steel producing area in the U.S. Indiana's other manufactures include pharmaceuticals and medical devices, automobiles, electrical equipment, transportation equipment, chemical products, rubber, petroleum and coal products, and factory machinery.

Despite its reliance on manufacturing, Indiana has been much less affected by declines in traditional [[Rust Belt]] manufactures than many of its neighbors. The explanation appears to be certain factors in the labor market. First, much of the heavy manufacturing, such as industrial machinery and steel, requires highly skilled labor, and firms are often willing to locate where hard-to-train skills already exist. Second, Indiana's labor force is located primarily in medium-sized and smaller cities rather than in very large and expensive metropolises. This makes it possible for firms to offer somewhat lower wages for these skills than would normally be paid. Firms often see in Indiana a chance to obtain higher than average skills at lower than average wages.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Manufacturers in Indiana | publisher=Purdue University Center for Rural Development | date=July 19, 1998}}</ref>

Indiana is home to the international headquarters and research facilities of pharmaceutical company [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] in Indianapolis, the state's largest corporation, as well as the world headquarters of Mead Johnson Nutritionals in Evansville.<ref>[http://wndu.com/news/112005/news_46007.php WNDU-TV: News Story: Bayer is leaving Elkhart – November 16, 2005]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> Overall, Indiana ranks fifth among all U.S. states in total sales and shipments of pharmaceutical products and second highest in the number of biopharmaceutical related jobs.<ref>{{cite web | title=Economy & Demographics | publisher=Terre Haute Economic Development Co. | url=http://www.terrehauteareaedc.com/econ_industry.htm | accessdate=January 30, 2007}}</ref>

Indiana is located within the U.S. [[Corn Belt]] and [[Grain Belt]]. The state has a feedlot-style system raising corn to fatten hogs and cattle. Along with corn, [[soybeans]] are also a major cash crop. Its proximity to large urban centers, such as [[Indianapolis]] and Chicago, assure that dairying, egg production, and specialty horticulture occur.
Other crops include melons, tomatoes, grapes, mint, popping corn, and tobacco in the southern counties.<ref>{{cite web | title=USDA Crop Profiles | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture | url=http://cipm.ncsu.edu/cropprofiles/cplist.cfm?org=state | accessdate=November 20, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070223130933/http://cipm.ncsu.edu/cropprofiles/cplist.cfm?org=state <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 23, 2007}}</ref> Most of the original land was not prairie and had to be cleared of deciduous trees. Many parcels of woodland remain and support a furniture-making sector in the southern portion of the state.

In 2011 Indiana was ranked first in the Midwest and sixth in the country for best places to do business according to CEO magazine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chiefexecutive.net/best-worst-states-for-business |title=Best/Worst States for Business &#124; ChiefExecutive.net &#124; Chief Executive Magazine |publisher=ChiefExecutive.net |date=May 3, 2011 |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref>

===State budget===
{{See also|Taxes in Indiana}}

Indiana does not have a legal requirement to balance the state budget either in law or its constitution. Instead, Indiana has a constitutional ban on assuming debt.
Indiana has a [[Rainy Day Fund]] and for healthy reserves proportional to spending.
Indiana is one of the few states in the U.S. which do not allow a line-item veto.

Indiana has a flat state [[income tax]] rate of 3.4%. Many Indiana counties also collect income tax. The state [[sales tax]] rate is 7% with exemptions for food, prescription medications and over-the-counter medications.<ref>{{cite web|title=State Sales Tax Rates|url=http://www.money-zine.com/Financial-Planning/Tax-Shelter/State-Sales-Tax-Rates/|publisher=Money-Zine.com|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref> In some jurisdictions an additional Food and Beverage Tax is charged, at a rate of 1% (Marion County's rate is 2%), on sales of prepared meals and beverages.<ref>{{cite web|title=INDIANA Retail Sales Tax & Use Tax|url=http://www.in.gov/dor/files/brochure3.pdf|work=Indiana Department of Revenue|publisher=State of Indiana|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}</ref>

[[Property tax]]es are imposed on both real and personal property in Indiana and are administered by the Department of Local Government Finance. Property is subject to taxation by a variety of taxing units (schools, counties, townships, cities and towns, libraries), making the total tax rate the sum of the tax rates imposed by all taxing units in which a property is located. However, a "circuit breaker" law enacted on March 19, 2008 limits [[property tax]]es to one percent of assessed value for homeowners, two percent for rental properties and farmland and three percent for businesses.

In Fiscal year 2011 Indiana reported one of the largest surpluses among U.S states, with an extra $1.2&nbsp;billion in its accounts. Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, authorized bonus payments of up to $1,000 for state employees on Friday, July 15, 2011. An employee who "meets expectations" will get $500, those who "exceed expectations" will receive $750 and "outstanding workers" will see an extra $1,000 in their August paychecks<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/17/many-states-celebrate-surpluses-as-congress-strugg/ |title=Many states celebrate surpluses as Congress struggles with debt |work=Washington Times |date=July 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 10, 2011}}</ref>

===Energy===
{{Further|List of Generating Stations in Indiana}}
[[File:Benton County Wind Farm 0011.jpg|thumb|A [[windfarm]] generates electricity in [[Benton County, Indiana|Benton County]].]]
Indiana's power production chiefly consists of the consumption of fossil fuels, mainly coal. Indiana has 24 coal power plants, including the largest coal power plant in the United States, [[Gibson Generating Station]], located across the Wabash River from [[Mount Carmel, Illinois]]. Indiana is also home to the coal-fired plant with the highest sulfur dioxide emissions in the United States, the [[R. Gallagher Generating Station|Gallagher]] power plant just west of New Albany.<ref>[http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2007/2007-07-26-05.asp Ens-newswire.com]</ref>

The state has an estimated coal reserves of fifty-seven billion tons; state mining operations produces thirty-five million tons of coal annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://igs.indiana.edu/coal/index.cfm|title=Coal in Indiana|author=Indiana Geological Survey|publisher=[[Purdue University]]|accessdate=October 19, 2010}}</ref> Indiana also possesses at least 900 million barrels of petroleum reserves in the [[Trenton Gas Field|Trenton Field]], though not easily recoverable.  While Indiana has made commitments to increasing use of renewable resources such as wind, hydroelectric, biomass, or solar power, however, progress has been very slow, mainly because of the continued abundance of coal in Southern Indiana. Most of the new plants in the state have been [[coal gasification]] plants. Another source is hydroelectric power.

[[Wind power in Indiana|Wind power]] is now being developed. New estimates in 2006 raised the wind capacity for Indiana from 30 MW at 50 m turbine height to 40,000 MW at 70 m, and to 130,000 MW at 100 m, in 2010, the height of newer turbines.<ref>[http://www.indianacleanpower.org/renewableresources.html Indiana's Renewable Energy Resources] Retrieved August 20, 2008</ref> As of the end of 2011, Indiana has installed 1,340 MW of wind turbines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.windpoweringamerica.gov/wind_installed_capacity.asp|title=WINDExchange: U.S. Installed Wind Capacity|work=windpoweringamerica.gov|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}</ref>

===Airports===
{{See also|List of airports in Indiana}}
[[Indianapolis International Airport]] serves the greater Indianapolis area and has finished constructing a new passenger terminal. The new airport opened in November 2008 and offers a new midfield passenger terminal, concourses, air traffic control tower, parking garage, and airfield and apron improvements.<ref>{{cite web | title=New Indianapolis Airport | publisher=Indianapolis Airport Authority | url=http://www.indianapolisairport.com | accessdate=January 6, 2007}}</ref>

Other major airports include [[Evansville Regional Airport]], [[Fort Wayne International Airport]] (which houses the [[122d Fighter Wing]] of the [[Air National Guard]]), and [[South Bend International Airport]]. A long-standing proposal to turn [[Gary Chicago International Airport]] into Chicago's third major airport received a boost in early 2006 with the approval of $48&nbsp;million in federal funding over the next ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gary Airpport Gets Millions in Federal Funding |publisher=CBS Channel 2 |url=http://cbs2chicago.com/topstories/local_story_016180843.html |accessdate=October 18, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20060218014515/http://cbs2chicago.com:80/topstories/local_story_016180843.html |archivedate=February 18, 2006 }}</ref>

The [[Terre Haute International Airport]] has no airlines operating out of the facility but is used for private flying. Since 1954, the [[181st Fighter Wing]] of the Indiana [[Air National Guard]] has been stationed at the airport. However, the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] (BRAC) Proposal of 2005 stated that the 181st would lose its fighter mission and [[F-16]] aircraft, leaving the Terre Haute facility as a general-aviation only facility.

The southern part of the state is also served by the [[Louisville International Airport]] across the Ohio River in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].
The southeastern part of the state is served by the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]] also across the Ohio River in [[Hebron, Kentucky]].
Most residents of [[Northwest Indiana]], which is primarily in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]], use the two Chicago airports, [[O'Hare International Airport]] and [[Chicago Midway International Airport]].

===Highways===
[[File:US Route 52 Lafayette.png|thumb|[[US Route 52]] in [[Lafayette, Indiana|Lafayette]] (2006).]]

The major U.S. [[List of Interstate Highways in Indiana|Interstate highways in Indiana]] are [[Interstate 64 in Indiana|Interstate&nbsp;64]] (I-64), [[Interstate 65 in Indiana|I-65]], [[Interstate 265 in Indiana|I-265]], [[Interstate 465|I-465]], [[Interstate 865|I-865]], [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|I-69]], [[Interstate 469|I-469]], [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|I-70]], [[Interstate 74 in Indiana|I-74]], [[Interstate 80 in Indiana|I-80]], [[Interstate 90 in Indiana|I-90]], [[Interstate 94 in Indiana|I-94]], and [[Interstate 275 (Ohio–Indiana–Kentucky)|I-275]]. The various highways intersecting in and around [[Indianapolis]], along with its historical status as a major railroad hub, and the canals that once crossed Indiana, are the source of the state's motto, the Crossroads of America. There are also many [[List of U.S. Routes in Indiana|U.S. routes]] and [[List of State Roads in Indiana|state highways]] maintained by the [[Indiana Department of Transportation]]. These are numbered according to the same convention as [[U.S. Highways]]. Indiana allows highways of different classifications to have the same number. For example, I-64 and [[Indiana State Road 64]] both exist (rather close to each other) in Indiana, but are two distinct roads with no relation to one another.

===County roads===
Most Indiana counties use a grid-based system to identify county roads; this system replaced the older arbitrary system of road numbers and names, and (among other things) makes it much easier to identify the sources of calls placed to the [[9-1-1]] system. Such systems are easier to implement in the glacially flattened northern and central portions of the state. Rural counties in the southern third of the state are less likely to have grids and more likely to rely on unsystematic road names (e.g., Crawford, Harrison, Perry, Scott, and Washington Counties).

There are also counties in the northern portions of the state that have never implemented a grid, or have only partially implemented one. Some counties are also laid out in an almost diamond-like grid system (e.g. Clark, Floyd, Gibson, and Knox Counties). Such a system is also almost useless in those situations as well. Knox County once operated two different grid systems for county roads because the county was laid out using two different survey grids, but has since decided to use road names and combine roads instead.

Notably, the county road grid system of St. Joseph County, whose major city is South Bend, uses perennial (tree) names (i.e. Ash, Hickory, Ironwood, etc.) in alphabetical order for North-South roads and Presidential and other noteworthy names (i.e. Adams, Edison, Lincoln Way, etc.) in alphabetical order for East-West roads. There are exceptions to this rule in downtown South Bend and Mishawaka. Hamilton county just continues the numbered street system from Downtown Indianapolis from 96th Street at the Marion County line to 296th street at the Tipton County line.

===Rail===
[[File:07 21 09 006xRP - Flickr - drewj1946.jpg|thumb|A [[South Shore Line|South Shore]] commuter train in [[Michigan City, Indiana|Michigan City]].]]
Indiana has over 4,255 railroad route miles, of which 91 percent are operated by Class I railroads, principally [[CSX Transportation]] and the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]. Other [[Class I railroad]]s in Indiana include the [[Canadian National Railway]] and [[Soo Line Railroad]], a [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] subsidiary, as well as [[Amtrak]]. The remaining miles are operated by 37 regional, local, and switching and terminal railroads. The [[South Shore Line (NICTD)|South Shore Line]] is one of the country's most notable commuter rail systems, extending from Chicago to [[South Bend]]. Indiana is currently implementing an extensive rail plan that was prepared in 2002 by the [[Parsons Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Indiana Rail Plan | publisher=Indiana Department of Transportation | url=http://www.in.gov/indot/3065.htm}}</ref> Many recreational trails, such as the [[Monon Trail]] and [[Cardinal Greenway]], have been created from [[rails-to-trails|abandoned rails routes]].

===Ports===
[[File:BurnsHarbor Harborlake view.jpg|thumb|Port of Indiana–Burns Harbor on [[Lake Michigan]].]]
Indiana annually ships over 70 million tons of cargo by water each year, which ranks 14th among all U.S. states. More than half of Indiana's border is water, which includes {{convert|400|mi|km|-1}} of direct access to two major freight transportation arteries: the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Seaway (via Lake Michigan) and the Inland Waterway System (via the Ohio River). The [[Port of Indiana|Ports of Indiana]] manages three major ports which include [[Burns Harbor, Indiana|Burns Harbor]], [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]], and [[Mount Vernon, Indiana|Mount Vernon]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Ports of Indiana Website | url=http://www.portsofindiana.com | accessdate=January 7, 2007}}</ref>

In [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] three public and several private port facilities receive year-round service from five major barge lines operating on the [[Ohio River]]. Evansville has been a [[United States Customs|U.S. Customs Port of Entry]] for more than 125 years. Because of this, it is possible to have international cargo shipped to Evansville in bond. The international cargo can then clear Customs in Evansville rather than a coastal port.

[[File:Main Building at the University of Notre Dame.jpg|thumb|The private Roman Catholic [[University of Notre Dame]] contains an endowment of $9.8 billion, the largest in Indiana.]]
Indiana's 1816 constitution was the first in the country to implement a state-funded [[public school (government funded)|public school]] system. It also allotted one township for a public university.<ref>{{cite web

In the 1840s, [[Caleb Mills]] pressed the need for tax-supported schools, and in 1851 his advice was included in the new state constitution.

Although the growth of the public school system was held up by legal entanglements, many public elementary schools were in use by 1870. Most children in Indiana attend public schools, but nearly 10% attend private schools and [[parochial school]]s. About one-half of all college students in Indiana are enrolled in state-supported four-year schools.

The largest educational institution is [[Indiana University]], the [[Indiana University Bloomington|flagship campus]] of which was endorsed as Indiana Seminary in 1820. [[Indiana State University]] was established as the state's [[Normal School]] in 1865; [[Purdue University]] was chartered as a [[Land-grant university|land-grant college]] in 1869. The three other independent state universities are [[Vincennes University]] (Founded in 1801 by the Indiana Territory), [[Ball State University]] (1918) and [[University of Southern Indiana]] (1965 as ISU - Evansville).

Many of the private colleges and universities in Indiana are affiliated with religious groups. The [[University of Notre Dame]] and the [[University of Saint Francis (Indiana)|University of Saint Francis]] are popular [[Roman Catholic school]]s. Universities affiliated with Protestant denominations include [[Anderson University (Indiana)|Anderson University]], [[Butler University]], [[Indiana Wesleyan University]], [[Taylor University]], [[Franklin College (Indiana)|Franklin College]], [[Hanover College]], [[DePauw University]], [[Earlham College]], [[Valparaiso University]], [[University of Indianapolis]],<ref name="ST"/> and [[University of Evansville]].<ref>{{cite web|title=About UE |publisher=[[University of Evansville]] |url=http://www.evansville.edu/aboutue/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/20100106123440/http://www.evansville.edu:80/aboutue/ |archivedate=January 6, 2010 }}</ref>

Indiana has an extensive history with [[auto racing]]. Indianapolis hosts the [[Indianapolis 500]] mile race over [[Memorial Day]] weekend at the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] every May. The name of the race is usually shortened to "Indy 500" and also goes by the nickname "The Greatest Spectacle in Racing." The race attracts over 250,000 people every year making it the largest single day sporting event in the world. The track also hosts the [[Allstate 400 at the Brickyard]] ([[NASCAR]]) and the [[Red Bull Indianapolis Grand Prix]] ([[MotoGP]]).
