'''Club Atlético de Madrid''', [[Sociedad Anónima Deportiva|SAD]] ({{IPA-es|ˈkluβ aðˈletiko ðe maˈðɾið}}) commonly known as '''Atlético Madrid''', or simply as '''Atlético''', is a Spanish professional [[Association football|football]] club based in [[Madrid]], that plays in [[La Liga]].

In terms of UEFA competition titles won, Atlético Madrid is Spain's 3rd most successful club behind [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. In terms of the [[Football records in Spain|number of titles]], Atlético Madrid is the fourth most successful club in Spanish football, behind Real Madrid, Barcelona and [[Athletic Bilbao]]. Atlético have won La Liga on ten occasions, including a league and cup double in 1996; the [[Copa del Rey]] on ten occasions; two [[Supercopa de España|Supercopas de España]] and one [[Copa Eva Duarte]]; in Europe, they won the [[1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1962, were runners-up in [[1963 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1963]] and [[1986 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1986]], were [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] runners-up in [[1974 European Cup Final|1974]], [[2014 UEFA Champions League Final|2014]] and [[2016 UEFA Champions League Final|2016]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/season=1973/index.html |title = 1973/74: Müller ends Bayern wait | publisher = [[UEFA]] | accessdate = 7 November 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101011155417/http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/season=1973/index.html| archivedate= 11 October 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> won the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] in 2010 and in 2012, won the [[UEFA Super Cup]] in 2010 and 2012,  as well as the [[1974 Intercontinental Cup]].

The club play their home games at the [[Vicente Calderón Stadium|Vicente Calderón]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadiumguide.com/vicentecalderon.htm | title = Estadio Vicente Calderón | publisher = The Stadium Guide | accessdate = 20 November 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101122024044/http://www.stadiumguide.com/vicentecalderon.htm| archivedate= 22 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> which holds up to 54,960 spectators. In 2016, Atlético are due to move to their new home of [[Estadio La Peineta]], which will have a capacity of 70,000. Atlético's home kit is red and white vertical striped shirts, with blue shorts, accompanied by blue and red socks. This combination has been used since 1911. The current club kits are manufactured by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the main sponsor is [[Plus500]].

During their history the club has been known by a number of nicknames, including ''Los Colchoneros'' ("The Mattress Makers"), due to their first team stripes being the same colours as old-fashioned mattresses. During the 1970s, they became known as ''Los Indios'', allegedly due to the club signing several South American players after the restrictions on signing foreign players were lifted. However, there are a number of alternative theories which claim they were named so because their stadium is "camped" on the river bank, or because ''Los Indios'' (The Indians) were the traditional enemy of ''Los Blancos'' (The Whites), which is the nickname of the club's city rivals, [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://eurorivals.net/derbies/real-madrid_v_atletico-madrid_derby.html | title = Real Madrid vs Atlético Madrid Derby: Great Local Football Derbies | publisher = Eurorivals | accessdate = 20 November 2010 }}</ref>

[[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]], the current king of Spain, has been the honorary president of the club since 2003. The club co-owns the [[Indian Super League]] franchise in [[Kolkata]], named [[Atlético de Kolkata]], which won the inaugural season of the competition in 2014.

==History==

===Foundation and first years (1903–1939)===
[[File:Enrique Allende.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Enrique Allende, first President of the club after its establishment in 1903.]]
The club was founded on 26 April 1903<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web | url = http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=31070/index.html | title = Classic club | publisher = [[FIFA]] | accessdate = 20 November 2010 }}</ref> as ''Athletic Club de Madrid'' by three [[Basque people|Basque]] students living in [[Madrid]]. These founders saw the new club as a youth branch of their childhood team, [[Athletic Bilbao]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/> In 1904, they were joined by dissident members of Real Madrid.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.atleticomadrid.azplayers.com/history.html | title = Atletico Madrid History | publisher = Atleticomadrid.azplayers | accessdate = 20 November 2010 }}</ref> They began playing in blue and white, similarly to Athletic Bilbao, but by 1911, Athletic were playing in their current colours of red and white stripes. Many believe the change was influenced because red and white striped tops were the cheapest stripes to make, because the same combination was used to make bed mattresses, and the unused cloth was easily converted into football shirts. This discovery of a cheaper option probably persuaded them to change and influenced the Madrid club being come to known as ''Los Colchoneros'' nickname. Another more plausible account of the reason to change colours is that both Athletic Bilbao and Athletic Madrid used to buy [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] blue and white kits in England.<ref name="theoffside1">{{cite web | url = http://atletico.theoffside.com/tidbits/the-atletico-crest-and-its-meaning.html | title = The Atlético Crest and its Meaning – The Offside – Atlético Madrid Spanish La Liga Football Blog | publisher = Atletico.theoffside | accessdate = 20 November 2010 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101103024251/http://atletico.theoffside.com/tidbits/the-atletico-crest-and-its-meaning.html| archivedate= 3 November 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Once in 1911, Juanito Elorduy, former player and member of the board of Athletic Madrid, went to England to buy kits for both teams. When he failed to find Blackburn Rovers kits to purchase, he instead bought [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] red and white ones. Athletic Madrid adopted the red and white shirt but opted to keep Blackburn Rovers' blue shorts, leading to them also being known as ''Los Rojiblancos''.

[[File:Atletico madrid 1911.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Atlético Madrid line up of 1911.]]
Atlético's first ground, the Ronda de [[Vallecas]], was situated in the eponymous working-class area on the south side of the city. In 1919, the Compañía Urbanizadora Metropolitana—the company that ran the underground communication system in Madrid—acquired some land, near the [[Ciudad Universitaria]]. And in 1921, Athletic Madrid became independent of parent-club Athletic Bilbao. As part of that project the company built a sports stadium, named [[Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid]], and Athletic had a new a 35,800-seat home.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thisisanfield.com/blog/2010/04/26/talking-history-atletico-madrid-vs-liverpool/ | title = Talking History: Atlético Madrid – This Is Anfield (Liverpool FC) | publisher = Thisisanfield | accessdate = 20 November 2010 }}</ref> The Metropolitano was used until 1966, when they moved to the new [[Vicente Calderón Stadium|Estadio Vicente Calderón]].<ref>[http://clubatleticodemadrid.com/es/elclub/instalaciones_club.asp clubatleticodemadrid.com]. clubatleticodemadrid.com. Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref> After the move, the Metropolitano was demolished and was replaced with university buildings and an office block belonging to the company ENUSA.

During the 1920s, Athletic won the ''Campeonato del Centro'' three times and were [[Copa del Rey]] runners-up in [[1921 Copa del Rey|1921]]; ironically, this final saw them face parent club Athletic Bilbao, as well as later in [[1926 Copa del Rey|1926]]. Based on this record, they were invited to join the Primera División of the inaugural [[La Liga]] in 1928. During their debut La Liga season, the club were managed by [[Fred Pentland]], but after two seasons in the Primera División they were relegated to [[Segunda División]]. They briefly returned to La Liga in 1934 but were relegated again in 1936 after [[Josep Samitier]] took over in mid-season from Pentland. Fortunately for ''Los Colchoneros'', the [[Spanish Civil War]] gave the club a reprieve, as [[Real Oviedo]] was unable to play due to the destruction of their stadium during the bombings. Thus, both La Liga and Athletic's relegation were postponed, the latter by winning a playoff against [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]], champion of the Segunda División tournament.

===Athletic Aviación de Madrid (1939–1947)===
By 1939, when La Liga had resumed, Athletic had merged with ''Aviación Nacional'' of [[Zaragoza]] to become ''Athletic Aviación de Madrid''. Aviación Nacional had been founded in 1939 by members of the [[Spanish Air Force]]. They had been promised a place in the Primera División for the 1939–40 season, only to be denied by the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation|RFEF]]. As a compromise, this club merged with Athletic, whose squad had lost eight players during the Civil War. The team were awarded a place in the [[1939–40 La Liga|1939–40]] La Liga campaign only as a replacement for Real Oviedo. With the legendary [[Ricardo Zamora]] as manager, the club subsequently won their first La Liga title that season and retained the title in [[1940–41 La Liga|1941]]. The most influential and charismatic player of these years was the captain [[Germán Gómez]], who was signed from [[Racing de Santander]] in 1939. He played eight consecutive seasons for the ''Rojiblancos'' until the [[1947–48 La Liga|1947–48 campaign]]. From his central midfield position, he formed a legendary midfield alongside Machín and [[Ramón Gabilondo]].
In 1941, [[Language politics in Francoist Spain|a decree issued by Francisco Franco]]<ref>[http://www.oleole.com/la-liga/history/ehiah.html La Liga History – Football League]. Ole Ole (6 April 2009). Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref> banned teams from using foreign names and the club became ''Atlético Aviacion de Madrid''. In 1947, the club decided to drop the military association from its name and settled on its current name of ''Club Atlético de Madrid''. The same year saw Atlético beat [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] 5–0 at the ''Metropolitano'', their biggest win over their cross-town rivals to date.<ref>[http://www.realatletico.com/ Real Madrid Vs. Atletico Madrid]. Realatletico.com. Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref>

===The Golden Age (1947–1965)===
[[File:Helenio Herrera Elgrafico.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Helenio Herrera]] won two Liga titles as Atlético manager]]
Under [[Helenio Herrera]] and with the help of [[Larbi Benbarek]], Atlético won La Liga again in [[1949–50 La Liga|1950]] and [[1950–51 La Liga|1951]]. With the departure of Herrera in 1953, the club began to slip behind Real Madrid and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] and for the remainder of the 1950s were left to battle it out with Athletic Bilbao for the title of third team in Spain.

However, during the 1960s and 1970s, Atlético Madrid seriously challenged Barcelona for the position of second team. The 1957–58 season saw [[Ferdinand Daučík]] take charge of Atlético, where he led them to second place in La Liga. This resulted in Atlético qualifying for the [[1958–59 European Cup|1958–59]] season of the [[European Cup]] since the winners, Real Madrid, were the reigning European champions. Inspired by Brazilian centre-forward [[Vavá]] and [[Enrique Collar]], Atlético reached the semi-finals after beating [[Drumcondra F.C.|Drumcondra]], [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]] and [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]].<ref>[http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro58.html European Cup & Champions League History 1955–2010]. Europeancuphistory.com. Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref> In the semi-finals, they met Real Madrid, who won the first leg 2–1 at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium|Santiago Bernabéu]] while Atlético won 1–0 at the ''Metropolitano''.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec195859.html European Competitions 1958–59].

Uefa.com (3 June 1959). Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref>

Atlético, however, gained their revenge when, led by former Real coach [[José Villalonga Llorente|José Villalonga]], they defeated Real in two successive [[Copa del Rey]] finals in [[Copa del Rey#Finals|1960]] and [[Copa del Rey#Finals|1961]]. In [[1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup|1962]], they won the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]], beating [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] 3–0 after a replay.<ref>[http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/history/season=1961/intro.html uefa.com – UEFA Cup Winners' Cup].

The following year the club reached the [[1962–63 European Cup Winners' Cup|1963]] final, but lost to [[Football League First Division|English]] side [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 5–1.<ref>[http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/history/season=1962/intro.html uefa.com – UEFA Cup Winners' Cup].

Atlético's best years coincided with dominant Real Madrid teams. Between 1961 and 1980, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning the competition 14 times. During this era, only Atlético offered Real any serious challenge, winning La Liga titles in [[1965–66 La Liga|1966]], [[1969–70 La Liga|1970]], [[1972–73 La Liga|1973]] and [[1976–77 La Liga|1977]] and finishing runners-up in [[1960–61 La Liga|1961]], [[1962–63 La Liga|1963]] and [[1964–65 La Liga|1965]]. The club had further success winning the Copa del Rey on three occasions in [[Copa del Rey#Finals|1965]], [[Copa del Rey#Finals|1972]] and [[Copa del Rey#Finals|1976]]. In 1965, when they finished as La Liga runners-up to Real after an intense battle for the title, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years.

===European Cup Finalists (1965–1974)===
Significant players from this era included the now-veteran [[Adelardo Rodríguez|Adelardo]] and regular goalscorers [[Luis Aragonés]], [[Javier Irureta]] and [[José Eulogio Gárate]], the latter winning the [[The Pichichi Trophy|''Pichichi'']] three times in 1969, 1970 and 1971. In the 1970s, Atlético also recruited several [[Argentina|Argentine]] personnel, signing [[Rubén Ayala]], Panadero Díaz and Ramón "Cacho" Heredia as well as coach [[Juan Carlos Lorenzo]]. Lorenzo believed in discipline, caution and disrupting the opponents' game, and although controversial, his methods proved successful—after winning La Liga in 1973, the club reached the [[1974 European Cup Final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=1973/overview/index.html#197374+muller+ends+bayern+wait |title=1973/74: Müller ends Bayern wait – |publisher=Uefa.com |date=15 May 1974 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref> On the way to the Final, Atlético knocked out [[Galatasaray S.K.

Rsssf.com. Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref> In the away leg of the semi-final against Celtic, Atlético had Ayala, Díaz, and substitute [[Quique Flores|Quique]] all sent off during a hard-fought encounter in what was reported as one of the worst cases of cynical fouling the tournament has seen. Because of this cynicism, they managed a 0–0 draw, which was followed by a 2–0 victory in the return leg with goals from Gárate and Adelardo.<ref>[http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro74.html European Cup & Champions League History 1955–2010]. Europeancuphistory.com. Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref> The Final at [[Heysel Stadium]], however, was a loss for Atlético. Against a [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] team that included [[Franz Beckenbauer]], [[Sepp Maier]], [[Paul Breitner]], [[Uli Hoeneß]] and [[Gerd Müller]], Atlético played above themselves. Despite missing Ayala, Díaz and Quique through suspension, they went ahead in extra-time with only seven minutes left. Aragonés scored with a superb, curling free-kick that looked like the winner, but in the last minute of the game, Bayern defender [[Georg Schwarzenbeck]] equalized with a stunning 25-yarder that left Atlético goalkeeper [[Miguel Reina]] motionless.<ref name="autogenerated1973">[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/history/season=1973/index.html 1973/74: Müller ends Bayern wait on].

===The Aragonés years (1974–1987)===
[[File:Luis Aragones.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Luis Aragonés]], Atlético's top scorer of all time and four-time club manager]]
Shortly after the defeat in the [[1973–74 European Cup|European Cup]], Atlético appointed their veteran player [[Luis Aragonés]] as coach. Aragonés subsequently served as coach on four separate occasions, from 1974 to 1980, from 1982 to 1987 once again 1991 until 1993 and finally from 2002 to 2003. His first success came quickly as Bayern Munich had refused to participate because of fixture congestion<ref name="autogenerated2">[http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/matchreport/newsid=510737.html Intercontinental Cup 1974]. FIFA.com. Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref> in the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] and as European Cup runners-up, Atlético were invited instead. Their opponents were [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]]<ref name="autogenerated2"/> of Argentina and, after losing the away leg 1–0, they won the return leg 2–0 with goals from [[Javier Irureta]] and [[Rubén Ayala]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/intconclub74.html Intercontinental Club Cup 1974]. Rsssf.com. Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref> Aragonés subsequently led the club to further successes in the Copa del Rey in [[Copa del Rey#Finals|1976]] and La Liga in [[1976–77 La Liga|1977]].

During his second spell in charge, Aragonés led the club to a runners-up finish in La Liga and a winner's medal in the Copa del Rey, both in 1985. He received considerable help from [[Hugo Sánchez]], who scored 19 league goals and won the [[The Pichichi Trophy|Pichichi]]. Sánchez also scored twice in the cup final as Atlético beat Athletic Bilbao 2–1. Sánchez, however, only remained at the club for one season before his move across the city to Real Madrid. Despite the loss of Sánchez, Aragonés went on to lead the club to success in the [[Supercopa de España]] in [[1985 Supercopa de España|1985]] and then guided them to the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]] final in [[1986 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|1986]]. Atlético, however, lost their third successive European final, this time 3–0 to [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].<ref>[http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/history/season=1985/intro.html uefa.com – UEFA Cup Winners' Cup].

===The Jesús Gil years (1987–2003)===
[[File:Radomir Antić.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Radomir Antić]] managed Atlético in three stints during the ownership of [[Jesús Gil]], winning a league and cup double in 1996]]
In 1987, controversial politician and businessman [[Jesús Gil]] became club president, running the club until his resignation in May 2003.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/3716251.stm | work=BBC News | title=Atletico owner Gil dies | date=14 May 2004}}</ref>

Atlético had not won La Liga for ten years and were desperate for league success. Right away, Gil spent heavily, bringing in a number of expensive signings, most notably Portuguese winger [[Paulo Futre]], who had just won the [[1987 European Cup Final|European Cup]] with [[FC Porto|Porto]].<ref>[http://www.bdfutbol.com/en/j/j2197.html Futre, Paulo Jorge Dos Santos Futre]. BDFutbol (28 February 1966). Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref> All the spending, however, only brought in two consecutive [[Copa del Rey]] trophies in [[1991 Copa del Rey Final|1991]] and [[1992 Copa del Rey Final|1992]] as the league title proved elusive. The closest Atlético came to the La Liga trophy was the [[1990–91 La Liga|1990–91 season]] when they finished runners-up by ten points to [[Johan Cruyff]]'s [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. In the process, Gil developed a ruthless reputation due to the manner in which he ran the club. In pursuit of league success, he hired and fired a number of high-profile head coaches, including [[César Luis Menotti]], [[Ron Atkinson]], [[Javier Clemente]], [[Tomislav Ivić]], [[Francisco Maturana]], [[Alfio Basile]] as well as club legend Luis Aragonés.

Gil also closed down Atlético's youth academy in 1992,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/nov/03/atletico-madrid-worst-run-club-europe | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Are 'madhouse' Atlético Madrid the worst run club in Europe? | first=Sid | last=Lowe | date=3 November 2009}}</ref> a move that would prove significant due to 15-year-old academy member [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]] who, as a result, went across town to later achieve worldwide fame with rivals Real Madrid.<ref>[http://www.spanish-fiestas.com/celebrities/raul-gonzalez.htm Raúl González], spanish-fiestas.com</ref> The move came as part of the overall Gil-initiated business restructuring of the club; Atlético became a [[Sociedad Anónima Deportiva]], a corporate structure benefiting from a then-recently introduced special legal status under Spanish corporate law, allowing individuals to purchase and trade club shares.

In the 1994–95 league campaign, Atlético only avoided relegation via a draw on the last day of the season. This prompted another managerial change along with a wholesale squad clearance during the summer 1995 transfer window. Somewhat unexpectedly, in the following 1995–96 season, newly arrived head coach Radomir Antić, with a squad including holdovers [[Antonio Muñoz Gómez|Toni]], [[Roberto Solozábal]], [[Delfí Geli]], [[Juan Vizcaíno]], [[José Luis Caminero]], [[Diego Simeone]] and [[Kiko (Spanish footballer)|Kiko]], as well as new acquisitions [[Milinko Pantić]], [[Luboslav Penev]], [[Santiago Denia|Santi Denia]] and [[José Francisco Molina]] finally delivered the much sought-after league title as Atlético won the [[La Liga]]/[[Copa del Rey]] double.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

The next season, 1996–97, saw the club take part in the Champions League for the first time. With expectations and ambitions raised, the most notable summer transfer signings were striker [[Juan Esnáider]] from Real Madrid and [[Radek Bejbl]], who was coming off a great showing for [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] at [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 1996]]. Playing on two fronts, Atlético fell out of the league title contention early while, in the Champions League, they were eliminated by [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in extra-time in the quarter-finals. Before the 1997–98 season, the heavy spending continued with the signings of [[Christian Vieri]] and [[Juninho Paulista|Juninho]]. All of the success, however, produced little change in the overall Gil strategy, and although Antić survived three consecutive seasons in charge, he was replaced during the summer of 1998 with [[Arrigo Sacchi]], who himself only remained in the managerial hot seat for less than six months. Antić then returned briefly in early 1999 only to be replaced with [[Claudio Ranieri]] at the end of the season. The 1999–2000 season proved disastrous for Atlético. In December 1999, Gil and his board were suspended pending an investigation into the misuse of club funds, with government-appointed administrator José Manuel Rubí running Atlético's day-to-day operations. With the removal of club President Jesús Gil and his board, the players performed poorly and the club floundered. Ranieri handed in his resignation with the club sitting 17th out of 20 in the league table and heading towards relegation. Antić, returning for his third coaching stint, was unable to prevent the inevitable. Despite reaching the [[Copa del Rey]] final, Atlético were relegated.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/apr/18/atletico-madrid-liverpool-europa-league | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Atlético Madrid can put end to glory of suffering in Liverpool semi | first=Sid | last=Lowe | date=18 April 2010}}</ref>

Atlético spent two seasons in the [[Segunda División]], narrowly missing out on promotion in 2001 before winning the Segunda División championship in 2002.

In 2006, Atlético signed [[Portugal national football team|Portuguese]] midfielders [[Costinha]] and [[Maniche]], as well as [[Argentina national football team|Argentine]] forward [[Sergio Agüero]].

In July 2007, the Atlético board reached an agreement with the City of Madrid to sell the land where their stadium is located and move the club to the City-owned [[Estadio La Peineta|Olympic Stadium]]. However, the new stadium will change hands in 2016 and be owned by the club. Madrid had applied to host the [[2016 Olympic Games]], losing out to [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>[http://football.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,6815033,00.html ''The Guardian''] 30 July 2007  {{wayback|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/breakingnews/feedstory/0,,6815033,00.html |date=20140413130803 |df=y }}</ref>

The [[2007–08 Atlético Madrid season|2007–08 season]] proved to be the most successful season for the club in the past decade. The team reached the round of 32 in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], where they were defeated by [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. They also reached the quarter-final round of the [[2007–08 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]], where they were beaten by eventual champions [[Valencia CF|Valencia]]. More significantly, the team finished the [[2007–08 La Liga|Liga season]] in fourth place, qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the first time since the [[1996–97 UEFA Champions League|1996–97 season]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec199697.html#cc European Competitions 1996–97].

[[File:Diego Forlán cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Forlán]] scored 32 La Liga goals for Atlético in 2008–09, making him the top scorer in Spain and Europe]]
On 3 February 2009, [[Javier Aguirre]] was dismissed from his post as manager after a poor start to the season, going without a win in six games. He later claimed that this was not accurate, and that he had left by mutual termination rather than through sacking.<ref>[http://theoriginalwinger.com/2009-02-03-javier-aguirre-walks-away-from-atletico Javier Aguirre Walks Away From Atletico]. TheOriginalWinger.com (3 February 2009). Retrieved 20 November 2010.</ref> There was public outrage after his dismissal, many believing he was not the cause of Atlético's problems, namely player Diego Forlán. He backed his former manager and said that, "Dismissing Javier was the easy way out, but he was not the cause of our problems. The players are to blame because we have not been playing well and we have been committing a lot of errors." This led to the appointment of [[Abel Resino]] as Atlético's new manager.<ref>[http://www.tribalfootball.com/abel-resino-atletico-madrid-job-dream-come-true-226006 Abel Resino: Atletico Madrid job dream come true | Spanish Football News]. tribalfootball.com.

Atlético's success continued in the latter half of the season when they placed fourth once again in the league table, securing a position in the playoff round of the UEFA Champions League. Striker Diego Forlán was crowned with the [[Pichichi Trophy]] and also won the [[European Golden Shoe]] after scoring 32 goals for Atlético that season.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1189961/Forlan-bags-second-Euro-Golden-Shoe-netting-32-times-La-Liga-season.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=Man United flop Forlan bags second Euro Golden Shoe after netting 32 times in La Liga | date=31 May 2009}}</ref> Atlético saw this domestic success as an opportunity to reinforce their squad for the upcoming Champions League season. They replaced veteran goalkeeper [[Leo Franco]] with [[David de Gea]] from the youth ranks and signed promising youngster [[Sergio Asenjo]] from [[Real Valladolid]]. Atlético also purchased [[Real Betis]] defender and Spanish international [[Juanito (footballer, born 1976)|Juanito]] on a free transfer. Despite pressure from big clubs to sell star players Agüero and Forlán, Atlético remained committed to keeping their strong attacking base in the hopes for a successful new season.

The [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10 Atlético season]], however, began poorly with many defeats and goals conceded. On 21 October, Atletico were hammered 4–0 by [[Premier League|English]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in the Champions League group stage.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8316478.stm|title=Chelsea 4 – 0 Atletico Madrid|date=21 October 2009|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Paul|last=Fletcher|accessdate=13 May 2010}}</ref> This defeat led Atletico's management to announce that manager [[Abel Resino]] had to leave.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8322014.stm|title=Atletico Madrid sack coach Resino |date=23 October 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=24 October 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091026110251/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8322014.stm| archivedate= 26 October 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> After failing to sign Danish former footballer [[Michael Laudrup]], Atlético Madrid made it official that the new manager for the rest of the season would be [[Quique Sánchez Flores]].<ref>[http://www.laligaweekly.com/2009/10/quique-to-atletico-madrid.html Quique to Atletico Madrid].

With the arrival of Quique Sánchez Flores as coach in October 2009, Atlético saw a huge change of fortunes. Though they continued to lag somewhat in La Liga during the 2009–10 season, finishing in the ninth position, they managed to get third place in the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League]] group stage and subsequently entered the [[2009–10 UEFA Europa League|season's Europa League]] in the round of 32, going on to win the Europa League, beating English teams [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the semi-finals and eventually [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/uefacup/7719190/Atletico-Madrid-coach-Quique-Sanchez-Flores-hails-players-resolve-against-Fulham.html | location=London | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | title=Atletico Madrid coach Quique Sanchez Flores hails players' resolve against Fulham | date=13 May 2010}}</ref> in the [[2010 UEFA Europa League Final|final]] held in the [[Volksparkstadion|HSH Nordbank Arena]] in [[Hamburg]] on 12 May 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8649664.stm|title=Liverpool 2 – 1 Atletico Madrid (agg 2 – 2)|date=29 April 2010|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|first=David|last=Ornstein|accessdate=13 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100512132933/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/8649664.stm| archivedate= 12 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=292076&cc=5739|title=Late winner breaks Fulham hearts|date=12 May 2010|publisher=[[ESPNsoccernet]]|accessdate=13 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100518145808/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=292076&cc=5739| archivedate= 18 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Diego Forlán scored twice, the second being an extra-time winner in the 116th minute, as Atlético Madrid won 2–1.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/fulham/7715512/Fulham-Atletico-Madrid.html|title=Fulham 1 Atlético Madrid 2 aet: match report|date=12 May 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group|first=Henry|last=Winter|authorlink=Henry Winter|location=[[HSH Nordbank Arena]], Hamburg|accessdate=12 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100515122819/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/fulham/7715512/Fulham-Atletico-Madrid.html| archivedate= 15 May 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

It was the first time since the [[1961–62 European Cup Winners' Cup]] that Atlético had claimed a European title. They also reached the [[2010 Copa del Rey Final|Copa del Rey Final]] on 19 May 2010, where they faced [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]], but lost 2–0 at the [[Camp Nou]] in [[Barcelona]].<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=292636&cc=5901 Report: Atlético Madrid v Sevilla FC – Spanish Copa del Rey – ESPN Soccernet].

Atlético won 2–0 with goals from [[José Antonio Reyes]] and [[Sergio Agüero]], Atlético's first win in the Super Cup.

Atlético had a comparatively disappointing 2010–11 season, finishing only seventh in the League and being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the [[2010–11 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] and the Group Stage of the [[Europa League 2010-11|Europa League]]. This ultimately led to the departure of manager Sánchez Flores before the conclusion of the season, who was replaced with ex-Sevilla manager [[Gregorio Manzano]], and who secured the final Europa League place for Atlético. Manzano himself was replaced with [[Diego Simeone]] in December 2011 after a poor run of form in La Liga.

Simeone led Atlético to their second [[2011–12 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] win in the three years since its creation, as they beat [[Athletic Bilbao]] 3–0 in the final on 9 May 2012 in [[Bucharest]] with [[Radamel Falcao]]—twice—and [[Diego Ribas da Cunha|Diego]] being the scorers.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/may/09/atletico-madrid-athletic-bilbao-europa-league | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jonathan | last=Wilson | title=Atlético Madrid 3–0 Athletic Bilbao | date=9 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/79438/atletico-madrid-vs-athletic-bilbao/report |title=Atl.

==Madrid derby==
{{Main|Madrid derby}}
[[File:Torres_running_at_goal_-_CdR_-_RM_v_ATL.jpg|thumb|Atlético playing  against Real Madrid in 2015]]
[[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and Atlético Madrid are clubs with contrasting identities and very different fates. While Real Madrid's [[Santiago Bernabeu Stadium]] proudly rises on [[Paseo de la Castellana]] in the [[upper class|wealthy]] [[Chamartín (Madrid)|Chamartín]] neighbourhood of northern Madrid, Atlético's less glamorous [[Vicente Calderón Stadium]] stands way down south, in the [[working class]] barrio of [[Arganzuela]]. Historically, Real Madrid have long been seen as the [[The Establishment|establishment]] club. On the other side, the ''Rojiblancos'' were always characterized by a ''sentimiento de rebeldía'', a sense of rebellion, although during the early [[Francisco Franco]] years, it was Atlético that was the preferred team of the regime, albeit forcibly.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} They were associated with the military airforce (renamed Atlético Aviación), until the regime's preferences moved towards Real Madrid in the 1950s.

Certainly, the dictatorial state sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's European Cup trophies at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; "Real Madrid are the best embassy we ever had", said one minister.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Such perceptions have had an important impact on the city's footballing identities, tapping into the [[collective consciousness]]. In this vein, Atlético fans were probably the originators, and are the most frequent singers, of the song, sung to the tune of the Real Madrid anthem, ''"Hala Madrid, hala Madrid, el equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país"'', "Go Madrid, go Madrid, the government's team, the country's shame."

Recently, Atlético Madrid had struggled massively in the derby, carrying a fourteen-year winless streak into the 2012–13 season.  However, the tide turned on 17 May 2013 when Atletico Madrid beat their city rivals 2–1 in Estadio Santiago Bernabeu to take home the Copa del Rey trophy, and continued on 29 September 2013 when they won a 1–0 victory, again in Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.

==Stadium information==
[[File:Estadio Vicente Calderón en el Atlético de Madrid-Schalke 04 (2008).jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Vicente Calderón Stadium]]]]

The club play their home games at the 54,990<ref name="uefa.com"/> seat [[Vicente Calderón Stadium|Estadio Vicente Calderón]] in southern [[Madrid]]. Before this, the club played originally at the Ronda de Vallecas until 1923. After the completion of the [[Estadio Metropolitano de Madrid]] in 1923, the club moved there until the Vicente Calderón was finished in 1966.

The club plan to move in 2016 to the renovated [[Estadio La Peineta]],<ref name=Madrid.es>{{cite web|last=Madrid.es|title=Ayuntamiento de Madrid – El Calderón se va al nuevo Estadio olímpico|url=http://www.madrid.es/portal/site/munimadrid/menuitem.650ba10afbb0b0aa7d245f019fc08a0c/?vgnextoid=246bd63ca9a2e110VgnVCM1000000b205a0aRCRD&vgnextchannel=6091317d3d2a7010VgnVCM100000dc0ca8c0RCRD|publisher=Madrid.es|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref> which will be expanded from a 20,000 seat capacity to 73,000 after it was used for Madrid's failed bid to host the [[2016 Summer Olympics]]. The Vicente Calderón will be demolished, and replaced by a waterfront park at the banks of the [[Manzanares River]] in Madrid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eufootball.biz/Stadia-Facilities/6502-atletico_madrid_new_stadium.html|title=Atletico Madrid to move to new stadium|date=15 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309223309/http://www.eufootball.biz/Stadia-Facilities/6502-atletico_madrid_new_stadium.html|archivedate=9 March 2009}}</ref> The club's training ground is the [[Ciudad Deportiva Atlético de Madrid]] in [[Majadahonda]], 20&nbsp;km west of Madrid. The facility maintains grass and artificial patches as well as a gym. Both the senior and youth squads train there.<ref>[http://clubatleticodemadrid.com/en/elclub/instalaciones_ciudad.asp clubatleticodemadrid.com]. clubatleticodemadrid.com.

==Kit==
[[File:Atlético de Madrid - 04.jpg|thumb|300px|Atlético players with kits stating "[[Azerbaijan]] [[The Land of Fire|Land of Fire]]"]]
[[File:Autobús del Atlético de Madrid (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|300px|Atlético de Madrid's bus, decorated with red and white colours.]]
Atlético began playing in blue and white, similar to Athletic Betis, but soon changed to their traditional red and white stripes by 1911. Many believe the change was influenced because red and white striped tops were the cheapest stripes to make, as the same combination was used to make bed mattresses, and the unused cloth was easily converted into football shirts. The kit has been made by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] for the past nine years, as the company wants to provide competition against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], who have a deal with [[Adidas]]. The current shirt sponsor is [[Plus500]], while [[Azerbaijan]] has a sponsor's logo on the back of the shirt. The shirt sponsorship by Azerbaijan has been condemned by [[Reporters Without Borders]], who satirized it in a campaign visual in which the shirt's vertical stripes become prison bars with the logo "Azerbaijan, Land of Repression".<ref>http://en.rsf.org/azerbaidjan-do-you-know-who-atletico-madrid-s-22-05-2014,46334.html Do you know who Atlético Madrid's real sponsor is?</ref> Atlético Madrid admits its sponsorship deal with Azerbaijan has a political dimension, saying the intention is to "promote the image of Azerbaijan".<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-27343540 Atletico Madrid: Azerbaijan logo edited out of Iran paper</ref> In August 2014, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights wrote to Atlético, calling on it to end the sponsorship by and promotion of Azerbaijan because of Azerbaijan's human rights record, calling it "one of the most repressive countries in the world".<ref>http://www.hfhr.pl/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/List_HFPC_AtleticoMadrid_20082014.pdf</ref>

Previously, the club was sponsored by [[Columbia Pictures]], who would change the shirt sponsor's logo, and occasionally the shirt itself, as they did with the away shirt when ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' was in cinemas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://footballspeak.com/post/2011/11/29/Football-sponsors.aspx |title=Football sponsors and their marketing strategy |publisher=Footballspeak.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref> Because shirts would have to be introduced and removed from shops at a very fast pace to keep up with film releases, Nike decided to not include a sponsor's logo on replica shirts made from 2002 to 2005.
