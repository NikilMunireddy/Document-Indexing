'''Henan''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:河南|河南]]}}) is a [[Provinces of China|province]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], located in the [[Central China|central part]] of the country. Its one-[[Chinese character|character]] abbreviation is "{{lang|zh|[[wikt:豫|豫]]}}" (yù), named after [[Yuzhou (nine ancient provinces)|Yuzhou]] ({{zh|c=豫州 |p=Yùzhōu |labels=no}}), a [[Han Dynasty]] state (''[[zhou (political division)|zhou]]'') that included parts of Henan. Although the name of the province ({{lang|zh|河南}}) means "south of the river",<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shenghuo/1090/2435218.html Origin of the Names of China's Provinces], [[People's Daily Online]].</ref> approximately a quarter of the province lies north of the [[Yellow River]], also known as the "Huang He".

Henan is often referred to as '''[[Central Plain (China)|Zhongyuan]]''' or '''Zhongzhou''' ({{zh|c=中州 |labels=no}}) which literally means "central plain land" or "midland", although the name is also applied to the entirety of [[China proper]]. Henan is the [[History of China|birthplace of Chinese civilization]] with over 3,000 years of recorded history, and remained China's cultural, economical, and political center until approximately 1,000 years ago. Numerous heritages have been left behind including the ruins of [[Shang Dynasty]] capital city [[Yinxu|Yin]] and the [[Shaolin Temple]]. Four of the [[Historical capitals of China|Eight Great Ancient Capitals of China]], [[Luoyang]], [[Anyang]], [[Kaifeng]], and [[Zhengzhou]] are located in Henan.

With an area of {{convert|167,000|km2|0|abbr=on}}, Henan covers a large part of the fertile and densely populated [[North China Plain]]. Its neighbouring provinces are [[Shaanxi]], [[Shanxi]], [[Hebei]], [[Shandong]], [[Anhui]], and [[Hubei]]. Henan is China's [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|third most populous province]] with a population of over 94 million. If it were a country by itself, Henan would be the [[List of countries by population|12th most populous country in the world]], behind [[Mexico]] and ahead of [[Vietnam]].

Henan is the 5th largest provincial economy of China and the largest among inland provinces. However, [[GDP per capita|per capita GDP]] is low compared to other eastern and central provinces, and Henan is considered to be one of the less developed areas in China. The economy continues to depend on its dwindling aluminum and coal reserves, as well as agriculture, heavy industry, tourism, and retail. High-tech industry and service sector is underdeveloped and is concentrated around Zhengzhou and Luoyang.

==History==
Widely regarded as the '''Cradle of Chinese civilization''' along with Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, but some may argue that Henan is a problematic province in China. Henan is known for its historical prosperity and periodic downturns. The economic prosperity resulted from its extensive fertile plains and its location at the heart of the country. However, its strategic location also means that it has suffered from nearly all of the major wars in China. In addition, the numerous floods of the [[Yellow River]] have caused significant damage from time to time. [[Kaifeng]], in particular, has been buried by the Yellow River's silt seven times due to flooding.

===Ancient Era===
[[File:Owl's face.jpg|thumb|260px|A [[Yangshao Culture|Yangshao]] pot carving of an owl]]
Archaeological sites reveal that prehistoric cultures such as the [[Yangshao Culture]] and [[Longshan Culture]] were active in what is now northern Henan since the [[Neolithic Era]]. The more recent [[Erlitou culture]] has been controversially identified with the [[Xia Dynasty]], the first and largely legendary Chinese dynasty that was established, roughly, in the 21st century&nbsp;BC. Virtually the entire kingdom existed within what is now north and central Henan.

The Xia Dynasty collapsed around the 16th century BC following the invasion of [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]], a neighboring [[Ancient Chinese States|vassal state]] centered around today's [[Shangqiu]] in eastern Henan. The [[Shang Dynasty]] (16th-11th centuries BC) was the first literate dynasty of China. Its many capitals are located at the modern cities of [[Shangqiu]], [[Yanshi]], and [[Zhengzhou]]. Their last and most important capital, [[Yinxu|Yin]], located in modern [[Anyang]], is where the first Chinese writing was created.
[[File:Shang-Orakelknochen excerpt adjusted for contrast.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Shang Dynasty oracle bone script, the first form of Chinese writing]]

In the 11th century BC, the [[Zhou Dynasty]] of [[Shaanxi]] arrived from the west and overthrew the Shang Dynasty. The capital was moved to [[Chang'an]], and the political and economical center was moved away from Henan for the first time. In 722 BC, when [[Chang'an]] was devastated by [[Xionites]] invasions, the capital was moved back east to [[Luoyang]]. This began the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], a period of warfare and rivalry. What is now Henan and all of China was divided into a variety of small, independent states, constantly at war for control of the central plain. Although regarded formally as the ruler of China, the control that Zhou king in Luoyang exerted over the feudal kingdoms had virtually disappeared. Despite the prolonged period of instability, prominent philosophers such as [[Confucius]] emerged in this era and offered their ideas on how a state should be run. [[Laozi]], the founder of [[Taoism]], was born in northern [[state of Chu|Chu]], part of modern-day Henan.

Later on, these states were replaced by seven large and powerful states during the [[Warring States period]], and Henan was divided into three states, the [[Wei (state)|Wei]] to the north, the [[state of Chu|Chu]] to the south, and the [[state of Han|Han]] in the middle. In 221&nbsp;BC, [[state of Qin]] forces from Shaanxi conquered all of the other six states, ending 800 years of warfare.

===Imperial Era===
[[Ying Zheng]], the leader of Qin, crowned himself (220 BCE) as the [[First Emperor]]. He abolished the feudal system and centralized all powers, establishing the [[Qin Dynasty]] and unified the core of the [[Han Chinese]] homeland for the first time. The empire quickly collapsed after the death (210 BCE) of Ying Zheng and was replaced by the [[Han Dynasty]] in 206&nbsp;BC, with its capital at [[Chang'an]]. Thus began a [[golden age]] of Chinese culture, economy, and military power. The capital moved east to [[Luoyang]] in 25&nbsp;AD, in response to a coup in [[Chang'an]] that created the short-lived [[Xin Dynasty]]. Luoyang quickly regained control of China, and the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] (25-220) began, extending the golden age for another two centuries.

The late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] saw war and rivalry between regional warlords. [[Xuchang]] in central Henan was the power base of [[Cao Cao]], who eventually succeeded in unifying all of northern China under the [[Kingdom of Wei]]. Wei then moved its capital to [[Luoyang]], which remained the capital after the unification of China by the Western [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin Dynasty]]. During this period Luoyang became one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the world, despite being repeatedly damaged by warfare.

With the fall of the Western Jin Dynasty in the 4th and 5th centuries, nomadic peoples from the north invaded northern China and established many successive regimes in northern China, including Henan. These people were gradually assimilated into the [[Chinese culture]] in a process known as [[sinification]].

The short-lived [[Sui Dynasty]] reunified China again in 589 with its capital back in [[Chang'an]]. It collapsed due to [[Emperor Yang of Sui China|Sui Emperor Yang's]] costly attempt to relocate the capital from [[Chang'an]] to [[Luoyang]] and the construction of many extravagant palaces there. The succeeding [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907) kept its capital in [[Chang'an]], marking the beginning of China's second golden age, with Henan being one of the wealthiest places in the empire.

The Tang Dynasty lasted for three centuries before it eventually succumbed to internal strife. In the [[Period of Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] (907-960) that followed, [[Kaifeng]] in eastern Henan became the capital of four dynasties. The [[Song Dynasty]] that reunified China in 982 also had its capital at [[Kaifeng]]. Under Song rule, China entered another era of culture and prosperity, and Kaifeng overtook Luoyang and Chang'an as the largest city in China and in the world.<ref>[http://geography.about.com/library/weekly/aa011201a.htm Largest Cities Through History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 1127, however, the Song Dynasty succumbed to [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchen]] ([[Jinn Dynasty|Jin Dynasty]]) invaders from the north in the [[Jin campaigns against the Song Dynasty|Jin–Song war]], and in 1142 [[Treaty of Shaoxing|ceded]] all of northern China, including Henan. The Song government moved its capital to [[Hangzhou]] in Southern China, which, under the [[Southern Song Dynasty]] (1127–1279) continued to enjoy relative economic and culture prosperity. A prolonged period of peace and cultural and economic prosperity in the [[Yangtze River]] delta ''[[Jiangnan]]'' region (modern southern [[Jiangsu]], northern [[Zhejiang]], and [[Shanghai]]) made this the new center of Chinese culture and economy.

Kaifeng served as the Jurchen's "southern capital" from 1157 (other sources say 1161) and was reconstructed during this time.<ref>[http://www.san.beck.org/AB3-China.html#9 Ethics of China 7 BC To 1279 by Sanderson Beck<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>http://www.upkorea.net/news/photo/7345-2-7037.pdf</ref> But the Jurchen kept their main capital further north, until 1214, when they were forced to move the imperial court southwards to [[Kaifeng]] in order to flee the [[Mongol]] onslaught. In 1234 they succumbed to combined [[Mongol]] and [[Song Dynasty]] forces. Mongols took control, and in 1279 they conquered all of China, establishing the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and set up the equivalent of modern Henan province, with borders very similar to the modern ones. Neither its territories nor its role in the economy changed under later dynasties. Henan remained important in the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368-1644) and [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1911) that followed, though its economy slowly deteriorated due to frequent natural disasters.

===Modern Era===
The [[Qing Dynasty]] was overthrown by the [[Republic of China]] in 1911, marking the beginning of China's modern era. The construction and extension of the [[Pinghan Railway]] and [[Longhai Railway]] had turned [[Zhengzhou]], a minor county town at the time, into a major transportation hub. Despite the rise of Zhengzhou, Henan's overall economy repeatedly stumbled as it was the hardest hit by the many disasters that struck China in its modern era.

Henan suffered greatly during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. In 1938, when the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] captured Kaifeng, the government led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] bombed the [[Huayuankou, Zhengzhou|Huayuankou]] dam in Zhengzhou in order to prevent the Japanese forces from advancing further. However, this caused massive flooding in Henan, [[Anhui]], and [[Jiangsu]] resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. In 1942 Henan was hit by [[Chinese famine of 1942-43|a great famine]] resulting from a mix of drought, locusts and destruction caused by the war. Grain requisition policies were continued by Chinese and Japanese authorities despite the shortage of food, making the death toll far greater than it might have been otherwise.

In 1954, the new government of the [[People's Republic of China]] moved the capital of Henan from [[Kaifeng]] to Zhengzhou, as a result of its economic importance. The PRC had earlier established a short-lived [[Pingyuan Province]] consisting of what is now northern Henan and western [[Shandong]] with [[Xinxiang]] as its capital. This province was abolished in 1952.

In 1958, Yashan in [[Suiping County]], Henan, became the first [[people's commune]] of China, heralding the beginning of the "[[Great Leap Forward]]". In the subsequent famines of the early 1960s popularly attributed to the Great Leap Forward, Henan was one of the hardest hit and millions of lives were lost.<ref>[http://www.boxun.com/hero/dangshi/21_1.shtml] {{wayback|url=http://www.boxun.com/hero/dangshi/21_1.shtml |date=20091121045710 }}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=January 2016}}

A destructive flooding of the [[Huai River]] in the summer of 1950 prompted large-scale construction of dams on its tributaries in central and southern Henan. 
Unfortunately, many of the dams were not able to withstand the extraordinarily high levels of rainfall caused by [[Typhoon Nina (1975)|Typhoon Nina]] in August 1975. Sixty-two dams, the largest of which was the [[Banqiao Dam]] in [[Biyang County]] collapsed; catastrophic flooding, spread over several counties throughout [[Zhumadian]] Prefecture and further downstream, killed at least 26,000 people.<ref name=yi>Yi Si, "The World's Most Catastrophic Dam Failures: The August 1975 Collapse of the Banqiao and Shimantan Dams", in: Dai Qing ''et al'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=R9w2RfP-mtQC&pg=PA36 The River Dragon Has Come!: The Three Gorges Dam and the Fate of China’s Yangtze River and Its People], pp. 25-38.</ref><ref name="After 30 years, secrets, lessons of China's worst dams burst accident surface">[http://english.people.com.cn/200510/01/eng20051001_211892.html After 30 years, secrets, lessons of China's worst dams burst accident surface]</ref> Unofficial human life loss estimates, including deaths from the ensuing epidemics and famine, range as high as 85,600,<ref name=yi/>  171,000<ref name=osnos>[[Evan Osnos]], "[http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2011/10/faust-china-and-nuclear-power.html Faust, China, and Nuclear Power]".

By the early 1970s, China was one of the poorest countries in the world, and Henan was one of the poorest provinces in China. In 1978, however, when the communist leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated the [[open door policy]] and embraced capitalism, China entered an economic boom that continues today. The boom did not reach inland provinces such as Henan initially, but by the 1990s Henan's economy was expanding at an even faster rate than that of China overall.

Henan has still not, however, entirely shed its reputation as an economic backwater. In recent years the prevalence of "selling blood" (blood donations for payment) among poor villagers has put Henan in the national spotlight. It was exposed that [[AIDS]] villages, where most of the population is [[HIV]] positive, exist in Henan. In many rural areas of China during the 1990s, particularly in the province of Henan, tens to hundreds of thousands of farmers and peasants were infected with HIV through participation in state-run blood collection programs in which contaminated equipment was reused.<ref name="Dong">Dong, Dong [http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/1/3/3/8/p113381_index.html The Discourse of HIV/AIDS in China: News Construction and Representation of the Chinese HIV Blood Scandal (1998-2002)] Annual Meeting of the International Communication Association, New Orleans Sheraton, New Orleans, May 27, 2004.</ref><ref name="bloodheadtk">Kellogg, Tom.

February 23, 2003.</ref> The initial cover up of the crisis by local officials, followed by the national exposure, has put Henan in a somewhat negative spotlight.

In November 2004, martial law was declared in [[Zhongmou County]], Henan, to quell deadly ethnic clashes between [[Han Chinese]] and the Muslim [[Hui Chinese]]. [http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501041115-750858,00.html]  The reported number of deaths ranged between 7 and 148.

==Geography==
[[File:Longmen-grottoes-longmen-mountain-from-a-distance.jpg|right|thumb|299px|[[Longmen Grottoes]] (Mt. Longmen), [[Luoyang]], Henan]]
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}

Henan has a diverse landscape with floodplains in the east and mountains in the west. Much of the province forms part the densely populated [[North China Plain]], an area known as the "breadbasket of China". The [[Taihang Mountains]] intrude partially into Henan's northwestern borders from [[Shanxi]], forming the eastern edge of [[Loess Plateau]]. To the west the [[Xionger Mountains|Xionger]] and [[Funiu Mountains]] form an extensive network of mountain ranges and plateaus, supporting one of the few remaining [[temperate deciduous forest]]s which once covered all of Henan. The renowned [[Mount Song]] and its [[Shaolin Temple]] is located in the far east of the region, near the capital city [[Zhengzhou]]. To the far south, the [[Dabie Mountains]] divides [[Hubei]] from Henan. The [[Nanyang Basin]], separated from North China Plain by these mountains, is another important agricultural and population center, with culture and history distinct from the rest of Henan and closer to that of Hubei's. Unlike the rest of northern China, [[desertification]] is not a problem in Henan, though sandstorms are common in cities near the Yellow River due to the large amount of sand present in the river.

The [[Yellow River]] passes through central Henan. It enters from the northwest, via the [[Sanmenxia Reservoir]]. After it passes [[Luoyang]], the mountains gave way to plains. Excessive amount of sediments are formed due to the [[silt]] it picks up from the Loess Plateau, raising the riverbed and causing frequent floods which shaped the habitat of the region. More recently however, construction of dams and [[levee]]s, as well as the depletion of water resources have ended the floods. The [[Huai River]] in southern Henan is another important river, and has been recognized as part of the boundary dividing [[Northern and southern China|northern and southern Chinese climate and culture]].

Henan shares borders with six other [[Province (China)|provinces]]. It is bordered to the west by [[Shaanxi]], to the south by [[Hubei]], and to the north by [[Shanxi]] (northwest) and [[Hebei]] (northeast). To the east lie [[Shandong]] (northeast) and [[Anhui]] (southeast), whose borders meet at a narrow strip of land which separates Henan from [[Jiangsu]] to the east.

===Climate===
Henan has a [[temperate]] climate that is [[humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'' or ''Cfa'') to the south of the Yellow River and bordering on [[humid continental]] (Köppen ''Dwa'') to the north. It has a distinct seasonal climate characterised by hot, humid summers due to the East Asian [[monsoon]], and generally cool to cold, windy, dry winters that reflect the influence of the vast [[Siberian]] [[anticyclone]]. Temperatures average around the freezing mark in January and 27 to 28&nbsp;°C in July.  A great majority of the annual rainfall occurs during the summer.

==Administrative divisions==
{{further|List of administrative divisions of Henan|List of township-level divisions of Henan}}
Henan is divided into seventeen [[Administrative divisions of China#Prefectural level|prefecture-level divisions]]: all [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]]; along with one directly-administered [[county-level city]] (a [[sub-prefecture-level city]]):

With a population of approximately 93.6 million, Henan is the third most populous Chinese province after Guangdong and Shandong. It is also the [[List of country subdivisions by population|fifth most populous sub-national division in the world]]. If it were a country by itself, it would be the twelfth most populous in the world, just behind Mexico and ahead of the Philippines. However, the [[hukou system]] shows Henan as the most populous province in China with over 103 million people, as it counts the migrant Henanese laborers as residents of Henan, instead of the province they currently reside in. On the other hand, Guangdong is shown as having only 81 million people, though the actual population is 95 million due to the influx of migrants from other provinces.

The population is highly homogeneous with 98.8% of the population being [[Han Chinese|Han]]. Small populations of [[Mongols]] and [[Manchus]] exists in scattered rural communities as well as major urban centers. 
Along with [[Jiangxi]], Henan has one of the most unbalanced gender ratios in China. As a result of the Chinese government's one-child policy (many parents do not want the only child to be female and abort the fetus), the gender ratio was 118.46 males for 100 females in 2000. Subsequently, aborting fetuses due to their female sex was banned in Henan and heavy fines are issued for those who violate the law. In addition, daughter-only families receive an annual allowance from the government.<ref>[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200609/30/eng20060930_307662.html People's Daily Online - China's most populous province legislates to curb gender imbalance<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Despite these efforts the problem seems to have become far worse. Based on a 2009 British Medical Journal study, the ratio is over 140 boys for every 100 girls in the 1-4 age group;<ref>[http://www.bmj.com/content/338/bmj.b1211.full China’s excess males, sex selective abortion, and one child policy: analysis of data from 2005 national intercensus survey | BMJ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> this might be a strong exaggeration, as many families with more than one child do not register their daughters to the hukou in order to escape fines.

According to a 2012 survey<ref name="CFPS2012"/> only around 13% of the population of Henan belongs to organised religions, the largest groups being [[Buddhism in China|Buddhists]] with 6.4%, followed by [[Protestantism in China|Protestants]] with 5.6%, [[Islam in China|Muslims]] with 1.3% and [[Catholicism in China|Catholics]] with 0.5%. Henan has some important centres of [[Chinese Buddhism]], the [[White Horse Temple]] and the famous [[Shaolin Monastery]].

Henan has also the largest Christian population by numbers and percentage of any province of China,<ref>[http://iwr.cass.cn/zjwh/201403/W020140303370398758556.pdf 当代中国宗教状况报告——基于CFPS（2012）调查数据]. p. 024</ref> 6.1% of the province's population {{As of|2012|lc=y}}, corresponding to approximately 7 million Christians, despite a significant decline from 9.33% {{As of|2009|lc=y}}.<ref name="Wang2015">China General Social Survey 2009, Chinese Spiritual Life Survey (CSLS) 2007.

The reports didn't give figures for other types of religion; 86% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in [[Chinese folk religion|worship of nature deities]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]] (for example, a sect that is endogenous to Henan is the [[Tianxian miaodao]]).

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Henan|List of provincial leaders of the People's Republic of China}}
The Government of Henan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in mainland China.

The [[Governor of Henan]] is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Henan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Henan [[Communist Party of China]] Provincial Committee Secretary, colloquially termed the "Henan [[CPC Party Chief]]".

==Economy==
Henan has seen rapid development in its economy over the past two decades, and its economy has expanded at an even faster rate than the national average of&nbsp;10%. This rapid growth has transformed Henan from one of the poorest provinces to one that matches other central provinces, though still relatively impoverished on a national scale. In 2011, Henan's nominal GDP was 3.20 trillion RMB (US$427 billion),<ref>[http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2012/01/27/chinas-provincial-gdp-figures-in-2011.html China’s Provincial GDP Figures in 2011 | China Briefing News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> making it the fifth largest economy in China, although it ranks nineteenth in terms of GDP per capita.

Henan is a semi-industrialized economy with an underdeveloped [[service sector]]. In 2009, Henan's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 277 billion RMB (US$40 billion), 1.097 trillion RMB (US$160 billion), and 563 billion RMB (US$82 billion), respectively. [[Agriculture]] has traditionally been a pillar of its economy, with the nation's highest [[wheat]] and [[sesame]] output and second highest [[rice]] output, earning its reputation as the breadbasket of China. Henan is also an important producer of [[beef]], [[cotton]], [[maize]], [[pork]], [[animal oil]], and [[corn]]. Food production and processing makes up more than 14% of the output from the province's secondary industry,<ref name="thechinaperspective.com">[http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/henan-province/ China Economy @ China Perspective<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  and it is said that 90% of Chinese [[McDonald's]] and [[KFC]] ingredients comes from Henan.<ref>[http://baike.baidu.com/view/2874.htm#3 河南_百度百科<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Although Henan's industry has traditionally been based on [[light textiles]] and [[food processing]], recent developments have diversified the industry sector to [[metallurgy]], [[petrol]], [[cement]], [[chemical industry]], [[machinery]] and [[electronics]]. Henan has the second largest [[molybdenum]] reserves in the world. [[Coal]], [[aluminum]], [[alkaline metals]] and [[tungsten]] are also present in large amounts in western Henan. Export and processing of these materials is one of the main sources of revenues.

Henan is actively trying to build its economy around the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, and it is hoped that the province may become an important transportation and manufacturing hub in the years to come.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com"/>  In 2008, the total trade volume (import and export) was US$17.5 billion, including US$10.7 billion for exports.  Since 2002, 7,111 foreign enterprises have been approved, and foreign funds ([[Foreign direct investment|FDI]]) of US$10.64 billion have been used in contracts with a realized FDI of US$5.3 billion. Foreign exchanges are increasing continuously. Friendly provincial relationships have been established with 16 states (districts) in the United States, Japan, Russia, France, Germany, and others.  Some cities of Henan have established friendly relationships ([[sister city]]) with thirty-two foreign cities.

Henan's service sector is rather small and underdeveloped. [[Finance]] and [[commerce]] are largely concentrated in urban centers such as [[Zhengzhou]] and [[Luoyang]], where the economy is fueled by a large and relatively affluent consumer base. In order to make the economy more knowledge and technology based, the government established a number of development zones in all of the major cities, promoting industries such as software, information technologies, new materials, bio-pharmaceutical and photo-machinery-electronics.<ref>[http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/zhengzhou-hi-tech-industrial-development-zone/ RightSite.asia | Zhengzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone]</ref> Henan is a major destination for [[tourism|tourist]]s, with places such as [[Shaolin Temple]] and [[Longmen Grottoes]] attracting millions of tourists each year.

==Transportation==
{{multiple issues|section=yes|
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
}}
Henan has some of the most advanced transportation system in China due to its flat terrain and its location at the heart of [[Rise of Central China|central China's construction boom]]. The [[Jingguang Railway|Jingguang]] and [[Longhai Railway]], the nation's two most important railways, run through much of the province and intersects at [[Zhengzhou]]. Other railway hubs such as [[Shangqiu]], [[Xinxiang]], and [[Luohe]] have also become important centers of trade and manufacturing as a result. A [[high-speed rail]]way links Zhengzhou with [[Xi'an]]. Henan's expressway system is highly developed and the total length is approximately {{convert|5,000|km|abbr=on}}, the highest total for any Chinese province. The state of air transport is less stellar, the only 3 public airports are located in [[Xinzheng]] (near Zhengzhou), [[Luoyang]], and [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]].

==Culture==
* Most of Henan speaks dialects of the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] group of dialects spoken in northern and southwestern China. Linguists put these dialects into the category of "[[Zhongyuan Mandarin]]". The northwestern corner of Henan is an exception, where people speak [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] dialects instead. The dialects of Henan are collectively called "the [[Henan dialect]]" in popular usage, with easily identifiable stereotypical features.
*[[Henan opera]] (''Yuju'') is the local form of [[Chinese opera]]; it is also well-known and popular across the rest of China. [[Henan Quju]] and [[Henan Yuediao]] are also important local opera forms.
*[[Henan cuisine]] is the local cuisine, with traditions such as the [[Luoyang Shuixi]] ([[Luoyang]] "Water Table", consisting entirely of various soups, etc.); [[Xinyang Duncai]] ([[Xinyang]] brewed vegetables), and the traditional [[Kaifeng cuisine|cuisine of Kaifeng]].
*Important traditional art and craft products include: [[Junci]], a type of porcelain originating in [[Yuzhou City|Yuzhou]] noted for its unpredictable colour patterns; the [[jade carving]]s of [[Zhenping County, Henan|Zhenping]]; and [[Luoyang]]'s [[Tangsancai]] ("Tang Three Colours"), which are earthenware figurines made in the traditional style of the [[Tang Dynasty]].

==Tourism==
Henan is located in the Yellow River valley where ancient people lived. Intricate pottery, writing and musical instruments of the [[Peiligang Culture]] and [[Yangshao Culture]] arose during [[neolithic]] times. Three of the [[Seven Ancient Capitals of China]] are in Henan: [[Luoyang]], [[Kaifeng]] and [[Anyang]]. Henan is one of the few provinces which has many historical relics in the country. There are 16 key national units of protecting historical relics and 267 provincial units of protecting historical relics. The over-ground historical relics are the second in China in number. Historical relics in museums take up one-eighth of those in China, and the underground historical relics are the first in China in number. In Henan Museum there are 120,000 historical relics, including over 40,000 rare ones.
