[[Cricket]] is a popular sport in Ahmedabad, which houses the 54,000-seat [[Sardar Patel Stadium]].

{{Main|History of Ahmedabad}}

The area around Ahmedabad has been inhabited since the 11th century, when it was known as ''[[Ashaval]]'' (or ''Ashapalli'').<ref>{{Cite book|author= Jane Turner|title=The Dictionary of Art|publisher=Grove|volume=1|isbn=9781884446009|page=471|year=1996}}</ref> At that time, [[Karandev I]], the [[Solanki]] ruler of Anhilwara (modern [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]]), waged a successful war against the [[Bhil]] king of Ashaval,<ref>{{Cite book| author=George Michell|author2=Snehal Shah|author3= [[John Burton-Page]]; Mehta, Dinesh|title=Ahmadabad|publisher=Marg Publications|date=28 July 2006|isbn=81-85026-03-3|pages=17–19}}</ref> and established a city called ''Karnavati'' on the banks of the Sabarmati.<ref name=Madan>{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page=173|editor=K.S.

In 1930, Gandhi initiated the [[Salt Satyagraha]] from Ahmedabad by embarking from his ashram on the [[Dandi Salt March]]. The city's administration and economic institutions were rendered inoperative in the early 1930s by the large numbers of people who took to the streets in peaceful protests, and again in 1942 during the [[Quit India Movement]]. Following independence and the [[partition of India]] in 1947, the city was scarred by the intense communal violence that broke out between [[Hinduism in India|Hindus]] and [[Islam in India|Muslims]] in 1947, Ahmedabad was the focus for settlement by Hindu migrants from Pakistan,<ref name="GillyGilinskiy2009">{{cite book|first1=Thomas Albert|last1=Gilly|first2=Yakov|last2=Gilinskiy|title=The Ethics of Terrorism: Innovative Approaches from an International Perspective (17 Lectures)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5SlnZilfMMC&pg=PA23|accessdate=26 June 2012|date=8 December 2009|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=978-0-398-07867-6|page=23}}</ref> who expanded the city's population and transformed its demographics and economy.

Many countries sought to emulate India's economic planning strategy and one of them, [[South Korea]], copied the city's second "Five-Year Plan".

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Ahmedabad}}
[[File:Cloth map of ahmedabad.jpg|thumb|upright|19th century painted cloth map of Ahmedabad]]

Ahmedabad lies at {{Coord|23.03|N|72.58|E|}} in [[western India]] at 53&nbsp;metres (174&nbsp;ft) above [[sea level]] on the banks of the [[Sabarmati]] river, in north-central Gujarat. It covers an area of {{convert|464|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="AMC">{{cite web|title=Amdavad city|url=http://www.egovamc.com/AhmCity/introduction_Eng.aspx|work=[[Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation]]|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref> The Sabarmati frequently dried up in the summer, leaving only a small stream of water, and the city is in a sandy and dry area. However with the execution of the [[Sabarmati Riverfront|Sabarmati River Front]]  Project and Embankment, the waters from the [[Narmada River|Narmada]] river have been diverted to the Sabarmati to keep the river flowing throughout the year, thereby eliminating Ahmedabad's water problems. The steady expansion of the [[Rann of Kutch]] threatened to increase desertification around the city area and much of the state; however, the Narmada Canal network is expected to alleviate this problem. Except for the small hills of [[Thaltej-Jodhpur Tekra]], the city is almost flat. Three lakes lie within the city's limits—[[Kankaria]], [[Vastrapur Lake|Vastrapur]] and Chandola. Kankaria, in the neighbourhood of [[Maninagar]], is an artificial lake developed by the Sultan of Delhi, [[Qutb-ud-din Aybak]], in 1451.<ref name="kankaria">{{Cite book|title=Gujarat State gazetteers|publisher=Directorate of Govt, Print., Stationery and Publications, Gujarat State|year=1984 |page=46}}</ref>

Ahmedabad is divided by the Sabarmati into two physically distinct eastern and western regions. The eastern bank of the river houses the old city, which includes the central town of [[Bhadra, Gujarat|Bhadra]]. This part of Ahmedabad is characterised by packed [[bazaar]]s, the ''[[pol (housing)|pol]]'' system of closely clustered buildings, and numerous places of worship. It houses the main [[railway station]], the main [[post office]], and some buildings of the Muzaffarid and British eras. The colonial period saw the expansion of the city to the western side of Sabarmati, facilitated by the construction of [[Ellis Bridge]] in 1875 and later the relatively modern [[Nehru Bridge]]. The western part of the city houses educational institutions, modern buildings, residential areas, shopping malls, multiplexes and new business districts centred around roads such as [[Ashram Road]], [[C. G. Road]] and [[Sarkhej-Gandhinagar Highway]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Ahmedabad Chronicle: Imprints of a millennium |publisher=Vastu-Shilpa Foundation for Studies and Research in Environmental Design |year=2002 | page=83 |chapter=Urban Structure and Growth}}</ref>

==Climate==
Ahmedabad has a hot, semi-arid climate ([[Köppen climate classification]]: [[Hot semi-arid climate|BSh]]), with marginally less rain than required for a [[tropical savanna climate]]. There are three main seasons: summer, monsoon and winter. Aside from the monsoon season, the climate is extremely dry. The weather is hot from March to June; the average summer maximum is {{convert|40|C|F|0}}, and the average minimum is {{convert|27|C|F}}. From November to February, the average maximum temperature is {{convert|30|C|F}}, the average minimum is {{convert|15|C|F}}, and the climate is extremely dry. Cold northerly winds are responsible for a mild chill in January. The southwest monsoon brings a humid climate from mid-June to mid-September. The average annual rainfall is about {{convert|800|mm|in}}, but infrequent heavy torrential rains cause local rivers to flood and it is not uncommon for droughts to occur when the monsoon does not extend as far west as usual. The highest temperature in the city was recorded on May 18 and 19, 2016 which was {{convert|50|C|F}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Idar records highest ever temp at 50.0|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-killer-heat-wave-hottest-day-in-ahmedabad-in-6-years-mercury-soars-to-50-degree-celsius-2213768|accessdate=18 May 2016|newspaper=Times of India|date=18 May 2016}}</ref>
