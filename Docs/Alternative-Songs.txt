Alternative Songs

{{About|the music chart|the music genre|Alternative rock}}
'''Alternative Songs''' (also called '''Alternative''' and formerly known as '''Modern Rock Tracks''' and '''Hot Modern Rock Tracks''') is a music chart in the United States that has appeared in [[Billboard magazine|''Billboard'' magazine]] since September 10, 1988.  It lists the 40 most-played songs on [[modern rock]] radio stations, most of which are [[alternative rock]] songs.  The chart was introduced as a companion to the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart and its creation was prompted by the explosion of alternative music on American radio in the late 1980s.

The chart is based solely on radio airplay. As of 2012, approximately 80 radio stations are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>{{cite news

Many rock artists do not release commercial [[single (music)|singles]] in the U.S.  Several popular songs which were not released as commercial singles did not qualify for the Hot 100 before December 1998, but performed very well on Modern Rock Tracks.

During the first several years of Modern Rock Tracks, the chart featured music that did not receive commercial radio airplay anywhere but on Modern Rock radio stations, of which there were few.  This included many [[electronica|electronic]] and [[post-punk]] artists.  Gradually, as alternative rock became more "mainstream" (particularly spearheaded by the [[grunge]] explosion in the early 1990s), the Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Tracks charts began featuring more of the same songs.  Today, the Alternative Songs chart (Modern Rock) favors more alternative rock, [[indie rock]], and [[punk rock]] bands while the Mainstream Rock Songs favor more [[hard rock]], [[post-grunge]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

The chart was renamed Alternative Songs beginning with the June 20, 2009 issue after ''Billboard'' fully absorbed ''[[Radio & Records]]'', whose similar chart was called "Alternative" instead of "Modern Rock".<ref>{{cite news
