The '''Hundred Years' War''' is the modern term for a series of conflicts waged from 1337 to 1453 by the [[House of Plantagenet]], rulers of the [[Kingdom of England]], against the [[House of Valois]], rulers of the [[Kingdom of France]], for control of the Kingdom of France. Each side drew many allies into the war. It was one of the most notable conflicts of the Middle Ages, in which five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the largest kingdom in Western Europe. The war marked both the height of [[chivalry]] and its subsequent decline, and the development of strong national identities in both countries.

After the [[Norman Conquest]], the kings of England were [[vassal]]s of the kings of France for their possessions in France. The French kings had endeavored, over the centuries, to reduce these possessions, to the effect that only [[Gascony]] was left to the English. The confiscation or threat of confiscating this duchy had been part of French policy to check the growth of English power, particularly whenever the English were at war with the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], an ally of France.

Through his mother, [[Isabella of France]], [[Edward III of England]] was the grandson of [[Philip IV of France]] and nephew of [[Charles IV of France]], the last king of the senior line of the [[House of Capet]]. In 1316, [[Salic law|a principle]] was established denying women succession to the French throne. When Charles IV died in 1328, Isabella, unable to claim the French throne for herself, claimed it for her son. The French rejected the claim, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right that she did not possess. For about nine years (1328–1337), the English had accepted the Valois succession to the French throne. But the interference of the French king, Philip VI, in Edward III's war against Scotland led Edward III to reassert his claim to the French throne. Several overwhelming English victories in the war—especially at [[Battle of Crécy|Crecy]], [[Battle of Poitiers|Poitiers]], and [[Battle of Agincourt|Agincourt]]—raised the prospects of an ultimate English triumph. However, the greater resources of the French monarchy precluded a complete conquest. Starting in 1429, decisive French victories at [[Battle of Patay|Patay]], [[Battle of Formigny|Formigny]], and [[Battle of Castillon|Castillon]] concluded the war in favour of France, with England permanently losing most of its major possessions on the continent.

Historians commonly divide the war into three phases separated by [[truce]]s: the [[Hundred Years' War (1337–60)|Edwardian Era War (1337–1360)]]; the [[Hundred Years' War (1369–89)|Caroline War (1369–1389)]]; and the [[Hundred Years' War (1415–53)|Lancastrian War (1415–1453)]]. Contemporary conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were directly related to this conflict, included the [[War of the Breton Succession]] (1341–1364), the [[Castilian Civil War]] (1366–1369), the [[War of the Two Peters]] (1356–1375) in Aragon, and the [[1383–85 Crisis]] in Portugal. Later historians invented the term "Hundred Years' War" as a [[periodization]] to encompass all of these events, thus constructing the longest military conflict in history.

The war owes its historical significance to multiple factors. By its end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although primarily a dynastic conflict, the war gave impetus to ideas of French and English nationalism.  The wider introduction of weapons and tactics supplanted the feudal armies where [[heavy cavalry]] had dominated. The  war precipitated the creation of the first [[standing army|standing armies]] in Western Europe since the time of the [[Western Roman Empire]], composed largely of commoners and thus helping to change their role in warfare. With respect to the belligerents, English political forces over time came to oppose the costly venture. The dissatisfaction of English nobles, resulting from the loss of their continental landholdings, became a factor leading to the civil wars known as the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455–1487). In France, civil wars, deadly [[List of epidemics|epidemics]], [[famine]]s, and bandit [[free company|free-companies]] of [[routiers|mercenaries]] reduced the population drastically. Shorn of its continental possessions, England was left with the sense of being an island nation, which profoundly affected its outlook and development for more than 500 years.<ref name="Gregory D. Cleva p. 87">As noted in, ''e.g.'', Gregory D. Cleva, ''Henry Kissinger and the American Approach to Foreign Policy'', Bucknell University Press, 1989; p. 87 ("the English Channel gave the nation a sense of geographical remoteness", while its "navy fostered a sense of physical unassailability" that lasted until the early 20th century).</ref>

==Origin of the conflict==
The root causes of the conflict can be found in the demographic, economic and social crises of 14th century Europe. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the Kings of France and England about Guyenne, Flanders and Scotland. The dynastic question, which arose due to an interruption of the direct male line of the Capetians, was the official pretext.

{{Main|English claims to the French throne}}
The question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] in 1316. Louis X left only a daughter, and [[John I of France|his posthumous son John I]] lived only a few days. Philip, Count of Poitiers, brother of Louis X, asserted that women were ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as [[Philip V of France]]. By the same law that he procured, his daughters were denied the succession, which passed to his younger brother, Charles IV, in 1322.<ref name=brissaud329>{{harvnb|Brissaud|1915|pp=329–330}}</ref>

Charles IV died in 1328, leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become king; if not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles.

By [[proximity of blood]], the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew [[Edward III of England]]. Edward was the son of [[Isabella of France|Isabella]], the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. The French nobility, moreover, balked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabelle and her lover Roger Mortimer, who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, Edward II. The assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus the nearest heir through male ancestry was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, Count of Valois, and it was decided that he should be crowned Philip VI. In 1340 the [[Avignon papacy]] confirmed that under [[Salic law]] males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.<ref name=brissaud329 /><ref name=orton872>{{harvnb|Previté-Orton|1978|p=872}}</ref>

Eventually, Edward III reluctantly recognized Philip VI and paid him [[homage (feudal)|homage]] for his French fiefs. He made concessions in Guyenne, but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made war on Scotland.

===The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty===
{{Main|Capetian-Plantagenet rivalry}}
{{Further|Peerage of France}}

[[File:Hommage of Edward I to Philippe le Bel.jpg|thumb|Homage of [[Edward I of England]] (kneeling) to [[Philip IV of France]] (seated), 1286. As [[Duke of Aquitaine]], Edward was also a vassal to the French King.]]
The [[Anglo-Norman]] dynasty that had ruled England since the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066 was brought to an end when the son of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou|Geoffrey of Anjou]] and [[Empress Matilda]], [[Henry II of England|Henry]] (great-grandson of [[William the Conqueror]]), became the first of the [[Angevin kings of England]] in 1154 as Henry II.<ref name=bartlett22>{{harvnb|Bartlett|2000|p=22}}</ref> The Angevin kings  directly ruled over [[Angevin Empire|more French territory]] than the kings of France. However, they still owed [[Homage (medieval)|homage]] for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century onward, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, effectively neutralising the issue.<ref name=bartlett17>{{harvnb|Bartlett|2000|p=17}}</ref>

[[John of England]] inherited the Angevin domains from [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. However, [[Philip II of France]] acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of most of the Angevin continental possessions. Following John's reign, the [[Battle of Bouvines]] (1214), the [[Saintonge War]] (1242), and finally the [[War of Saint-Sardos]] (1324) resulted in the complete loss of Normandy and the reduction of England's holdings on the continent to a few provinces in Gascony.<ref name=ehistory>{{harvnb|Gormley|2007}} [http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/archive/hundredyearswar.cfm?CFID=12106913&CFTOKEN=48989585&jsessionid=463076a37003e50bfe0063343a5d3c64687b] Ohio State University</ref>

The dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France and must recognize the sovereignty of the King of France over Guyenne. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.

During the War of Saint-Sardos, [[Charles, Count of Valois|Charles of Valois]], father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by [[Edward II of England]]. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.

The King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus Agen. But the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.

===Gascony under the King of England===

]]
In the 11th century, [[Gascony]] in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as ''Guyenne'' or ''Guienne'') and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: ''Guyenne-et-Gascogne''). The [[Angevin kings of England]] became [[Dukes of Aquitaine]] after [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] married the former Queen of France, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous.<ref name=harris8>{{harvnb|Harris|1994|p=8}}</ref><ref name=prestwich298>{{harvnb|Prestwich|1988|p=298}}</ref> At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin ([[Plantagenet]]) Kings of England in southwest France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine.<ref name=prestwich298 /><ref name=prestwich292>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|pp=292–293}}</ref>

For the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French [[suzerainty]]. However, this line of argument could not be maintained by the English, so in 1329 the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals should approach their liege unarmed with heads uncovered, however Edward demonstrated his reluctance by attending the ceremony by wearing his crown and sword.<ref name=wilson194>{{harvnb|Wilson|2011|p=194}}</ref>  Despite Edward complying, albeit reluctantly, the French continued to pressure the English administration.<ref name=prestwich394>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|p=394}}</ref>

Gascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was [[Robert III of Artois]]. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court.<ref name=prestwich306>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|p=306}}</ref>

===Franco-Scot alliance===
{{See also|Auld Alliance}}
The Kings of England had attempted to subjugate the [[Scottish people|Scots]] for some time, which made Scotland a natural ally of France. In 1295 a treaty was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]]. Charles IV formally [[Treaty of Corbeil (1326)|renewed the treaty]] in 1326, promising Scotland that if England invaded then France would support the Scots. Similarly, the French would find Scottish support if their own kingdom was attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support.<ref name=prestwich304>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|pp=304–305}}</ref>

Philip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish Navy, moved to the [[English Channel]] off Normandy in 1336, threatening England.<ref name=prestwich306/> To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots "at a suitable time", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king.<ref name=sumption180>{{harvnb|Sumption|1991|p=180}}</ref>

===End of homage===
At the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The ''[[arrière-ban]]'', literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as  vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' Robert d'Artois.<ref name=sumption184>{{harvnb|Sumption|1991|p=184}}</ref> Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne. When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'.<ref name=prestwich149>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2003|pp=149–150}}</ref>

On 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the Count of [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. The civic authorities of Ghent, Ypres and Bruges proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the [[Low Countries]]. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the "true" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties.<ref name=prestwich307>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|pp=307–312}}</ref>

Relations with Flanders were also tied to the English wool trade, since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] sit on the [[woolsack]] in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade.<ref name="friar480">{{harvnb|Friar|2004|pp=480–481}}</ref> At the time there were about 110,000 [[History of Sussex#Wool|sheep in Sussex]] alone.<ref name="darby160">R.E.Glassock.

Successive governments were able to make large amounts of money by taxing it.<ref name="friar480"/> France's sea power led to economic disruptions for England, shrinking the wool trade to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]] and the wine trade from Gascony.<ref name=sumption188>{{harvnb|Sumption|1991|pp=188–189}}</ref><ref name=sumption233>{{harvnb|Sumption|1991|pp=233–234}}</ref>

===Outbreak, the English Channel and Brittany===
[[File:BattleofSluys.jpeg|thumb|Battle of Sluys from a [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|manuscript]] of [[Froissart's Chronicles]], Bruge, c.1470]]

Edward, with his fleet, sailed from England on 22 June 1340, and arrived the next day off the [[Zwin|Zwyn estuary]]. The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off the port of [[Sluis]]. The English fleet apparently tricked the French into believing they were withdrawing. However, when the wind turned in the late afternoon, the English attacked with the wind and sun behind them. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as the [[Battle of Sluys]]. England dominated the English Channel for the rest of the war, preventing French [[invasions]].<ref name=prestwich307 /> At this point, Edward's funds ran out and the war probably would have ended were it not for the death of the [[John III, Duke of Brittany|Duke of Brittany]] precipitating a succession dispute between the duke's half brother [[John of Montfort]] and [[Charles I, Duke of Brittany|Charles of Blois]], nephew of Philip VI.<ref name=rogers88>{{harvnb|Rogers|2010|pp=88–89}}</ref>

In 1341, conflict over the succession to the [[Duchy of Brittany]] began the [[War of the Breton Succession]], in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois. Action for the next few years focused around a back and forth struggle in Brittany. The city of [[Vannes]] changed hands several times, while further campaigns in Gascony met with mixed success for both sides.<ref name=rogers88 />

===Battle of Crécy and the taking of Calais===
[[File:Crécy - Grandes Chroniques de France.jpg|thumb|Battle of Crécy, 1346]]
[[File:Edward III counting the dead on the battlefield of Crécy.jpg|thumb|[[Edward III]] counting the dead on the battlefield of Crécy]]

In July 1346, Edward mounted a major invasion across the channel, landing in Normandy's [[Cotentin]], at St. Vaast. The English army captured the completely unguarded [[Caen]] in just one day, surprising the French. Philip gathered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march northward toward the Low Countries, pillaging as he went, rather than attempting to take and hold territory. He reached the river Seine to find most of the crossings destroyed.  He moved further and further south, worryingly close to Paris, until he found the crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so the carpenters within his army were able to fix it. He then continued on his way to Flanders until he reached the river Somme. The army crossed at a tidal ford at Blanchetaque, leaving Philip's army stranded. Edward, assisted by this head start, continued on his way to Flanders once more, until, finding himself unable to outmanoeuvre Philip, Edward positioned his forces for battle and Philip's army attacked. 

The [[Battle of Crécy]] was a complete disaster for the French, largely credited to the [[English longbow]]men and the French king, who allowed his army to attack before it was ready.<ref name=prestwich318>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|pp=318–319}}</ref> Philip appealed to his Scottish allies to help with a diversionary attack on England. King [[David II of Scotland]] responded by invading northern England, but his army was defeated and he was captured at the [[Battle of Neville's Cross]], on 17 October 1346. This greatly reduced the threat from Scotland.<ref name=rogers88 /><ref name=rogers55>{{harvnb|Rogers|2010|pp=55–45}}</ref> In France, Edward proceeded north unopposed and besieged the city of [[Calais]] on the English Channel, capturing it in 1347. This became an important strategic asset for the English, allowing them to safely keep troops in northern France.<ref name=prestwich318 /> Calais would remain under English control, even after the end of the Hundred Years' War, until the successful [[Siege of Calais (1558)|French siege in 1558]].<ref name=grummitt1>{{harvnb|Grummitt|2008|p=1}}</ref>

===Battle of Poitiers and the Treaty of Brétigny===
In 1348, the [[Black Death]], which had just arrived in Paris, began to ravage Europe.<ref>''The Black Death'', transl. & ed. Rosemay Horrox, (Manchester University Press, 1994), 9.</ref> In 1356, after the plague had passed and England was able to recover financially, Edward's son and namesake, the [[Prince of Wales]], later known as the [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]], invaded France from Gascony, winning a great victory in the [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)|Battle of Poitiers]].<ref name=rogers88 /> During the battle, the Gascon noble [[Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch|Jean de Grailly]], [[captal de Buch]] led a mounted unit that was concealed in a forest. The French advance was contained, at which point de Grailly led a flanking movement with his horsemen cutting off the French retreat and succeeding in capturing King [[John II of France]] (known as John the Good) and many of his nobles.<ref name=patourel20>{{harvnb|Le Patourel|1984|pp=20–21}}</ref><ref name=wilson218>{{harvnb|Wilson|2011|p=218}}</ref> With John held hostage, his son the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] (later to become [[Charles V of France]]) assumed the powers of the king as [[Regency (government)|regent]].<ref name=guignebert304>{{harvnb|Guignebert|1930|loc=Volume 1. pp.304–307}}</ref>

After the Battle of Poitiers, many French nobles and mercenaries rampaged, and chaos ruled. A contemporary report recounted:
<blockquote>
... all went ill with the kingdom and the State was undone. Thieves and robbers rose up everywhere in the land. The Nobles despised and hated all others and took no thought for usefulness and profit of lord and men. They subjected and despoiled the peasants and the men of the villages. In no wise did they defend their country from its enemies; rather did they trample it underfoot, robbing and pillaging the peasants' goods...<br />

[[File:Black Monday hailstorm.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Black Monday (1360)|Black Monday]] (1360), hailstorms and lighting ravage the English army at Chartres]]
Edward invaded France, for the third and last time, hoping to capitalise on the discontent and seize the throne. The Dauphin's strategy was that of non-engagement with the English army in the field. However, Edward wanted the crown and chose the cathedral city of [[Reims]] for his coronation (Reims was the traditional coronation city).<ref name=prestwich326>{{harvnb|Prestwich|2005|p=326}}</ref> However, the citizens of Reims built and reinforced the city's defences before Edward and his army arrived.<ref name=patourel189>{{harvnb|Le Patourel|1984|p=189}}</ref> Edward besieged the city for five weeks, but the defences held and there was no coronation.<ref name=prestwich326 /> Edward moved on to Paris, but retreated after a few skirmishes in the suburbs. Next was the town of [[Chartres]]. Disaster struck in a [[Black Monday (1360)|freak hailstorm]] on the encamped army, causing over 1,000 English deaths. This devastated Edward's army and forced him to negotiate when approached by the French.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Hail kills English troops - Apr 13, 1360 - HISTORY.com|url = http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hail-kills-english-troops|website = HISTORY.com|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> A conference was held at Brétigny that resulted in the [[Treaty of Brétigny]] (8 May 1360).<ref name=patourel32>{{harvnb|Le Patourel|1984|p=32}}</ref> The treaty was ratified at Calais in October.

==First peace: 1360–69==
The French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Brétigny set his ransom at 3&nbsp;million&nbsp;crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son [[Louis I of Anjou|Louis of Anjou]], a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honour-bound to return to captivity in England.<ref name="guignebert304"/><ref name=wsbretigny />

The French crown had been at odds with [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] (near southern Gascony) since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power.<ref name=wagner102>{{harvnb|Wagner|2006|pp=102–103}}</ref> Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence.

===Aquitaine and Castile===

In 1366 there was a civil war of succession in [[Crown of Castile#Ascension of the Trastámara dynasty|Castile]] (part of modern Spain). The forces of ruler [[Peter of Castile]] were pitched against those of his half-brother [[Henry II of Castile|Henry of Trastámara]]. The English crown supported Peter and the French, Henry. French forces were led by [[Bertrand du Guesclin]], a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trastámara in his invasion of Castile.<ref name=curry69>{{harvnb|Curry|2002|pp=69–70}}</ref>

Peter appealed to England and Aquitaine's [[Black Prince]] for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Brétigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castille. Peter was restored to power after Trastámara's army was defeated at the [[Battle of Najera]].<ref name=wagner78>{{harvnb|Wagner|2006|p=78}}</ref>

Although the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castille campaign, the prince instituted a [[hearth tax]]. [[Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret|Arnaud-Amanieu VIII]], Lord of [[Albret]] had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his ''parlement'' in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again and Edward III resumed the title of King of France.<ref name=wagner122>{{harvnb|Wagner|2006|p=122}}</ref> Charles V declared that all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt.<ref name=wagner122 /><ref name=wagner3>{{harvnb|Wagner|2006|pp=3–4}}</ref>

With the Black Prince gone from Castile, Henry de Trastámara led a second invasion that ended with Peter's death at the [[Battle of Montiel]] in March 1369. The new Castilian regime provided naval support to French campaigns against Aquitaine and England.<ref name=wagner78 />

===English turmoil===
With his health continuing to deteriorate, the Black Prince returned to England in January 1371, where by now his father Edward III was elderly and also in poor health. The prince's illness was debilitating, and he died on 8 June 1376.<ref name=dnbbarber>{{Cite web|last=Barber|first=Richard|title= Edward , prince of Wales and of Aquitaine (1330–76)'' in '' Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn.

It was usual to appoint a [[regent]] in the case of a child monarch, but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised the power of kingship from the date of his accession in 1377.<ref name=dnbtuck /> However, between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in the hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred this to a regency led by the king's uncle, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]], although Gaunt remained highly influential.<ref name=dnbtuck />

Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including the [[Peasants' Revolt]] led by [[Wat Tyler]] in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384–85. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for the protection of Calais against the French made him increasingly unpopular.<ref name=dnbtuck />

{{See also|Civil war between the Armagnacs and the Burgundians}}
[[File:Assassinat louis orleans.jpg|thumb|[[Assassination of Louis I, Duke of Orléans]]]]
The war became increasingly unpopular with the English public largely due to the high taxes needed to sustain it. These taxes were seen as one of the reasons for the Peasants' revolt.<ref name=baker6>{{harvnb|Baker|2000|p=6}}</ref> Richard's increasing disinterest in the war together with his preferential treatment of a select few close friends and advisors  angered  an alliance of lords that included one of his uncles. This group, known as [[Lords Appellant]], managed to successfully press charges of treason against five of Richard's advisors and friends in the [[Merciless Parliament]].  The Lords Appellant were  able to gain control of the council in 1388 and tried, unsuccessfully, to reignite the
war in France. Although the will was there, the funds to pay the troops was lacking, so in the autumn of 1388 the Council agreed to resume negotiations with the French crown, beginning on 18 June 1389 with the signing of a three-year truce at [[Truce of Leulinghem|Leulinghen]].<ref name=baker6 /><ref name=neillands182>{{harvnb|Neillands|1990|pp=182–184}}</ref>

In 1389, Richard's uncle and supporter, John of Gaunt, returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his authority and destroyed the principal three among the Lords Appellant. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt's son, the exiled [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]]. Bolingbroke returned to England  with his supporters and deposed Richard and had himself crowned Henry IV.<ref name=dnbtuck /><ref name=neillands182 /><ref name=curry77>{{harvnb|Curry|2002|pp=77–82}}</ref>

In Scotland, the English regime change prompted border raids that were countered by an invasion in 1402 and the defeat of a Scottish army at the [[Battle of Humbleton Hill|Battle of Homildon Hill]].<ref name=mortimer253>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2008|pp=253–254}}</ref> A dispute over the spoils between Henry and [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]] resulted in a long and bloody struggle between the two for control of northern England, resolved only with the almost complete destruction of the [[House of Percy|Percy family]] by 1408.<ref name=mortimer263>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2008|pp=263–264}}</ref><ref name=dnbbean>{{Cite web|last=Bean|first=J.M.W|title= Percy, Henry, first earl of Northumberland (1341–1408)'' in '' Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn.

In Wales, [[Owain Glyndŵr]] was declared [[Prince of Wales]] on 16 September 1400. He was the leader of the most serious and widespread rebellion against English authority in Wales since the conquest of 1282–83. The rebellion was finally put down only in 1415 and resulted in Welsh semi-independence for a number of years.<ref name=dnbsmith>{{Cite web|last=Smith|first=Llinos|title= Glyn Dŵr , Owain (c.1359–c.1416)'' in '' Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn.

In the meantime [[Charles VI of France]] was descending into madness and an open conflict for power began between his cousin [[John the Fearless]] and his brother, [[Louis of Valois, Duke of Orléans|Louis of Orléans]]. After Louis's assassination, the [[Armagnac (party)|Armagnac]] family took political power in opposition to John. By 1410, both sides were bidding for the help of English forces in a civil war.<ref name=curry77 /> In 1418 Paris was taken by the Burgundians, who massacred the [[Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac|Count of Armagnac]] and about 2,500 of his followers.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sizer|first=Michael|title=The Calamity of Violence: Reading the Paris Massacres of 1418 |year=2007|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/w/wsfh/0642292.0035.002/--calamity-of-violence-reading-the-paris-massacres-of-1418?rgn=main;view=fulltext|accessdate=29 December 2013}}</ref>

Throughout this period, England confronted repeated raids by [[pirates]] that heavily damaged trade and the navy. There is some evidence that Henry IV used state-legalised piracy as a form of warfare in the English Channel. He used such [[privateer]]ing campaigns to pressure enemies without risking open war.<ref name=hattendorf76>Ian Friel.

The domestic and dynastic difficulties faced by England and France in this period quieted the war for a decade.<ref name=nolan424 />

Henry IV of England died in 1413 and was replaced by his eldest son Henry V. Charles VI of France's mental illness allowed his power to be exercised by royal princes whose rivalries caused deep divisions in France. Henry V was well aware of these divisions and hoped to exploit them. In 1414 while he held court at [[Leicester]], he received ambassadors from Burgundy.<ref name=dnballmand>{{Cite web|last=Allmand|first=C.T|title= Henry V (1386–1422)'' in '' Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn.

Henry accredited envoys to the French king to make clear his territorial claims in France; he also demanded the hand of Charles VI's youngest daughter [[Catherine of Valois]]. The French rejected his demands, leading Henry to prepare for war.<ref name=dnballmand />

===Burgundy alliance and the taking of Paris===

====Battle of Agincourt (1415)====
{{Main|Battle of Agincourt}}
[[File:Agincour.JPG|thumb|Fifteenth-century miniature depicting the Battle of Agincourt.]]

In August 1415, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] sailed from England with a force of about 10,500 and laid siege to [[Harfleur]]. The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September 1415. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, he elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of [[Crécy]], he found himself outmaneuvered and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], north of the [[Somme (river)|Somme]]. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed.<ref name="population"/> Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths.<ref name=dnballmand />

====Treaty of Troyes (1420)====
{{Main|Treaty of Troyes}}
[[File:Clan member crest badge - Clan Carmichael.svg|thumb|[[Clan Carmichael]] crest with broken spear commemorating the unseating of the Duke of Clarence.]]

Henry retook much of Normandy, including Caen in 1417, and [[Rouen]] on 19 January 1419, turning Normandy English for the first time in two centuries. A formal alliance was made with the Duchy of Burgundy, which had taken Paris after the assassination of Duke [[John the Fearless]] in 1419. In 1420, Henry met with King Charles VI. They signed the [[Treaty of Troyes]], by which Henry finally married Charles' daughter Catherine of Valois and Henry's heirs would inherit the throne of France. The Dauphin, [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]], was declared illegitimate. Henry formally entered Paris later that year and the agreement was ratified by the [[French States-General|Estates-General]].<ref name=dnballmand />

====Death of Clarence (1421)====
On 22 March 1421 Henry V's progress in his French campaign experienced an unexpected reverse. Henry had left his brother and presumptive heir [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]] in charge while he returned to England. Clarence engaged a Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by [[Gilbert Motier de La Fayette]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Buchan]] at the [[Battle of Baugé]]. Clarence, against the advice of his lieutenants, before his army had been fully assembled, attacked with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. He then, during the course of the battle, led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing melée, the Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of Clarence. Once on the ground, the duke was slain by [[Sir Alexander Buchanan|Alexander Buchanan]].<ref name=dnballmand /><ref name=wagner44>{{harvnb|Wagner|2006|pp=44–45}}</ref> The body of the Duke of Clarence was recovered from the field by [[Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury]], who conducted the English retreat.<ref name=harris>G.

===English success===
Henry V returned to France and went to Paris, then visiting Chartres and Gâtinais before returning to Paris. From there he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of [[Meaux]]. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422.<ref name=dnballmand />

At the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at [[Senlis]]. While there it became apparent that he was ill (possibly [[dysentery]]) and when he set out to the Upper Loire he diverted to the royal castle at Vincennes, near Paris, where he died on 31 August 1422.<ref name=dnballmand /> The elderly and insane Charles VI of France died two months later, on 21 October 1422. Henry left an only child, his nine-month-old son, [[Henry VI of England|Henry]], later to become Henry VI.<ref name=dnbgriffiths />

On his deathbed, Henry V had given the Duke of Bedford responsibility for English France (as Henry VI was only an infant). The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the [[Battle of Verneuil]], (17 August 1424). At the Battle of Baugé, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army. The effect of the battle was to virtually destroy the Dauphin's field army and to eliminate the Scots as a significant military force for the rest of the war.<ref name=dnbgriffiths /><ref name=wagner307>{{harvnb|Wagner|2006|pp=307–308}}</ref>

==French victory: 1429–53==

===Joan of Arc and French revival===
[[File:Joan of arc miniature graded.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Joan of Arc]] (c.1450–1500)]]

The appearance of [[Joan of Arc]] at the [[siege of Orléans]] sparked a revival of French spirit, and the tide began to turn against the English.<ref name=dnbgriffiths /> The English laid [[siege]] to Orléans in 1428, but their force was insufficient to fully [[investment (military)|invest]] the city. In 1429 Joan convinced the Dauphin to send her to the siege, saying she had received visions from God telling her to drive out the English. She raised the morale of the troops, and they attacked the English [[redoubt]]s, forcing the English to lift the siege. Inspired by Joan, the French took several English strongholds on the Loire.<ref name=davis76>{{harvnb|Davis|2003|pp=76–80}}</ref>

The English retreated from the Loire Valley, pursued by a French army. Near the village of [[Battle of Patay|Patay]], French cavalry broke through a unit of English longbowmen that had been sent to block the road, then swept through the retreating English army. The English lost 2,200 men, and the commander, [[John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury]], was taken prisoner. This victory opened the way for the Dauphin to march to [[Reims]] for his coronation as Charles VII, on 16 July 1429.<ref name=davis76 /><ref name=nrofast />

After the coronation, Charles VII's army fared less well. An attempted French [[Siege of Paris (1429)|siege of Paris]] was defeated on 8 September 1429, and Charles VII withdrew to the Loire Valley.<ref>{{cite book |last= Jaques|first= Tony|date= |title= 2007|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tW_eEVbVxpEC&pg=PA777&lpg=PA777&dq=French+siege+of+Paris+was+defeated+on+8+September+1429&source=bl&ots=pxigJl0nf5&sig=ZD952C3hb3tOmPBK7uGJ2AHwFbk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Ti3AVNLrGunksATYnYDwDg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=French%20siege%20of%20Paris%20was%20defeated%20on%208%20September%201429&f=false|location= Westport, Connecticut|publisher= Greenwood Press|page= 777|isbn= |accessdate= January 21, 2015}}</ref>

===Henry's coronations and the desertion of Burgundy===
[[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] was crowned king of England at Westminster Abbey on 5 November 1429 and king of France at Notre-Dame, in Paris, on 16 December 1431.<ref name=dnbgriffiths >{{harvnb|Griffiths|2004}}</ref>

[[File:Siege orleans.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The first Western image of a battle with cannon: the [[Siege of Orleans|Siege of Orléans]] in 1429.]]

Joan of Arc was captured by the Burgundians at the siege of Compiegne on 23 May 1430. The Burgundians transferred her to the English, who organised a trial headed by Pierre Cauchon, a pro-English clergyman. Joan was condemned for heresy and burned at the stake on 30 May 1431.<ref name=davis76 /> (She was rehabilitated 25 years later by Pope Callixtus III).

After the death of Joan of Arc, the fortunes of war turned dramatically against the English.<ref name=lee145>{{harvnb|Lee|1998|pp=145–147}}</ref> Most of Henry's royal advisers were against making peace. Among the factions, the Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, the Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas [[Cardinal Beaufort]] was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems that at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]], in the summer of 1435, where the duke of Beaufort was mediator, the English were unrealistic in their demands. A few days after the congress ended in September, [[Philip III, duke of Burgundy]], deserted to Charles VII, signing the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|Treaty of Arras]] that returned Paris to the King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France.<ref name=dnbgriffiths /> The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was replaced by a lesser man.<ref name=lee145 />

===French resurgence===
[[File:Vigiles du roi Charles VII 32.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Formigny (1450)]]

The allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but the English focus on expanding their domains into the Low Countries left them little energy to intervene in France.<ref name=sumption562>{{harvnb|Sumption|1991|p=562}}</ref> The long truces that marked the war gave Charles time to centralise the French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies with a more modern professional army that could put its superior numbers to good use. A castle that once could only be captured after a prolonged siege would now fall after a few days from cannon bombardment. The French artillery developed a reputation as the best in the world.<ref name=lee145 />

By 1449, the French had retaken [[Rouen]]. In 1450 the [[Count of Clermont]] and Arthur de Richemont, Earl of Richmond, of the Montfort family (the future [[Arthur III, Duke of Brittany]]), caught an English army attempting to relieve Caen and defeated it at the [[Battle of Formigny]]. The English army had been attacked from the flank and rear by Richemont's force just as they were on the verge of beating Clermont's army.<ref name=nicole26>{{harvnb|Nicolle|2012|pp=26–35}}</ref>

===Fall of Gascony===
[[File:Charles VII by Jean Fouquet 1445 1450.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charles VII of France|Charles "the Victorious"]].]]
After Charles VII's successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were defeated at the [[Battle of Castillon]] on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordnance officer [[Jean Bureau]] and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son.<ref name=wagner79>{{harvnb|Wagner|2006|p=79}}</ref>

===End of the war===
Although the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War,<ref name=wagner79 /> England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the [[Wars of the Roses]], that started in 1455.<ref name=lee145 /><ref name=webster39>{{harvnb|Webster|1998|pp=39–40}}: "Every version of the complaints put forward by the rebels in 1450 harps on the losses in France."</ref>
{{Campaignbox Burgundian Wars}}
The Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke [[Charles the Bold|Charles of Burgundy]], counting on English support, [[Burgundian Wars|took up arms]] against [[Louis XI of France]]. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying [[Edward IV of England]] off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in an agreement signed at the [[Treaty of Picquigny]] (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to [[English claims to the French throne|claim the title]] until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King [[Louis XVIII of France]], who was living in England after the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=neillands290>{{harvnb|Neillands|1990|pp=290–291}}</ref>

==Significance==
[[File:Map France 1477-en.svg|thumb|Burgundian territories (orange/yellow) and limits of France (red) after the Burgundian War.]]

The Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that [[warfare]] taught. The feudal system was slowly disintegrating throughout the hundred years war.

Before the Hundred Years' War, heavy cavalry (knights) was considered the most powerful unit in an army, but by the war's end, this belief had shifted. The heavy horse was increasingly negated by the use of the longbow (and, later, another long-distance weapon: firearms). Edward III was famous for dismounting his men-at-arms and having them and his archers stand in closely integrated battle lines; the horses only being used for transport or pursuit.<ref name=powicke189>{{harvnb|Powicke|1962|p=189}}</ref> The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as [[hobelar]]s. Hobelars tactics had been developed against the Scots, in the Anglo-Scottish wars of the 14th century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured horses, enabling them to move through difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Rather than fight while seated on the horse, they would dismount to engage the enemy.<ref name=rogers267>Colm McNamee. Hobelars ''in'' {{harvnb|Rogers|2010|pp=267–268}}</ref><ref name=jonesr1>{{harvnb|Jones|2008|pp=1–17}}</ref><ref name="RolandPreston1991">{{harvnb|Preston|Wise|Werner|1991|pp=84–91}}</ref>

By the end of the Hundred Years' War, these various factors caused the decline of the expensively outfitted, highly trained heavy cavalry and the eventual end of the armoured [[knight]] as a military force and of the [[nobility]] as a political one.<ref name="RolandPreston1991" />

The war stimulated nationalistic sentiment. It devastated France as a land, but it also awakened French nationalism. The Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state.<ref name=holmes61 /> In 1445 the first regular standing army since Roman times was organised in France partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as [[compagnies d'ordonnance]] on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors.<ref name="RolandPreston1991" />

The conflict developed such that it was not just between the Kings of England and France but also between their respective peoples. There were constant rumours in England that the French meant to invade and destroy the English language. National feeling that emerged from such rumours unified both France and England further. The Hundred Years' War basically confirmed the fall of the [[Anglo-Norman language|French language in England]], which had served as the language of the ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest until 1362.<ref name=holmes61>{{harvnb|Holmes, Jr|Schutz|1948|p=61}}</ref>

[[File:Bubonic plague map.PNG|thumb|The spread of the [[Black Death]] (with modern borders).]]
Lowe (1997) argued that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war – sales taxes, debasing the coinage – and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French.<ref>{{harvnb|Lowe|1997|pp=147–195}}</ref>

Bubonic [[Plague (disease)|plague]] and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War.<ref name="population">{{harvnb|Turchin|2003|pp=179–180}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=mUoCrTUo-eEC&pg=PA179 Historical dynamics: why states rise and fall]</ref> [[Normandy]] lost three-quarters of its population, and Paris two-thirds.<ref>{{harvnb|Ladurie|1987|p=32}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=VT9rIMQFt2MC&pg=PA32 The French peasantry, 1450–1660]</ref> The population of England was reduced by 20 to 33 percent due to plague in the same period.<ref name=neillands110>{{harvnb|Neillands|1990|pp=110–111}}</ref>

When the war ended, England was bereft of its Continental possessions (with the exception of the [[Pale of Calais]]), leaving it an island nation on the periphery of Europe, which greatly affected the English mind-set.<ref name="Gregory D. Cleva p. 87"/>  Although this fate could have consigned England to the margins of history, it came just as the [[Age of Exploration]] was about to begin.  The nation of maritime islanders found itself well-suited to take advantage of its location and seafaring abilities to explore, and later conquer, [[British Empire|much of the remaining world]].
