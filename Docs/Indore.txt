==History==
[[File:Tookajee Rao Holkar.jpg|thumb|[[Tukoji Rao Holkar|Tookajee Rao Holkar II]], Indore, from a drawing by Mr. W. Carpenter, Jun.," from the Illustrated London News, 1857]]

===Origins===
Indore owes its early growth to trade and commerce, which is still a dominant feature of the city. It is the commercial capital of the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The present city is about 500 years old. Till the end of 15th century, its original nucleus was a river side village which occupied the bank of river Saraswati. This area is now known as ''Juni Indore''.

The area of the modern Indore city was a part of the [[Kampel, Indore|Kampel]] [[pargana]] (administrative unit) during the [[Mughal Empire]].<ref name="gazetteer_1971">{{cite book | title = Madhya Pradesh District Gazetteers: Indore | editor = P N Shrivastav | year = 1971 | edition = First | publisher = Government Central Press | pages = 2, 55–59 }}</ref> Kampel was administered by the [[Ujjain]] ''sarkar'' (government) of [[Malwa Subah]] (province). The area was controlled by the local [[zamindar]]s (feudal landlords), who accepted the suzerainty of the Mughal empire. The zamindars received the title of ''[[Chowdhury|Chaudhari]]'', which established their claim to the land.

The modern settlement was developed by [[Rao Nandlal Chaudhary]], the chief local Zamindar, who had an army of 2000 soldiers. Under the Mughal rule, his family enjoyed great influence and was accorded confirmatory ''[[deed|sanad]]''s by the Emperors [[Aurangzeb]] and [[Farrukhsiyar]], confirming their [[jagir]] (land ownership) rights. When Nandlal visited the Mughal court at [[Delhi]], he received a special place in the emperor's court along with two jewel studded swords (now on display in the Royal British Museum under the family's name) and confirmatory ''sanad''s. [[Jai Singh II]], a personal friend of his, gave him a special "Gold Langar" which guaranteed a special place to him in all the courts of India.
[[File:The Maharaja Holkar of Indore Late 19th Century Photograph.JPG|thumb|[[Shivajirao Holkar|HH The Maharaja Shivaji Rao Holkar of Indore]]]]

In the mid-1710s, Nandlal was caught in the struggle between the [[Maratha empire|Marathas]] and the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]] (who had been appointed as the governor of the [[Deccan]] region by the Mughal emperor). Once, while visiting the Indreshwar Temple near the banks of river Saraswati, Nandlal found the location to be safe and strategically located, being surrounded by rivers on all sides. He started moving his people in, and constructed the fort of Shree Sansthan Bada Rawala to protect them from harassment by the warring forces. This marked the establishment of the present-day Indore city, which became an important trade center on the Delhi-Deccan route.

===The Maratha Raj (Holkar Era)===
{{main|Holkar}}
[[File:Tukojirao III Maharaja Holkar of Indore.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Tukojirao Holkar III|HH Tukoji Rao Holkar III, The Maharaja of Indore (1890-1978)]] by [[James Eckford Lauder|James Lauder]], [[London]]]]
By 1720, the headquarters of the local [[pargana]] were transferred from Kampel to Indore, due to the increasing commercial activity in the city. On 18 May 1724, the Nizam accepted the rights of the [[Maratha]] [[Peshwa]] [[Baji Rao I]] to collect [[chauth]] (taxes) from the area. In 1733, the [[Peshwa]] assumed the full control of Malwa, and appointed his commander [[Malhar Rao Holkar]] as the [[Subahdar|Subhedar]] (Governor) of the province.<ref name=malcolm-memoirs>Major General Sir [[John Malcolm]], ''Memoirs of Malwa'' (1912)</ref> Nandlal Chaudhary accepted the suzerainty of the [[Marathas]]. During the [[Maratha empire|Maratha rule]], the Chaudharis came to be known as "Mandloi"s (derived from [[Tehsil|Mandal]]s meaning districts). The [[Holkar]]s conferred the title of ''Rao Raja'' upon Nandlal's family.<ref>Major General Sir John Malcolm, ''Central India, Part I'', pp. 68–70</ref> The family retained its possessions of nobility, in addition to the right of performing the first puja of [[Dushera]] (''Shami Pujan'') before the [[Holkar|Holkar rulers]].

On 29 July 1732, [[Peshwa|Bajirao Peshwa-I]] granted Holkar State by merging 28 and half parganas to [[Malhar Rao Holkar]], the founder ruler of [[Holkar|Holkar dynasty]]. His daughter-in-law [[Ahilyabai Holkar]] moved the state's capital to [[Maheshwar]] in 1767, but Indore remained an important commercial and military centre.

===British Era (Indore/Holkar State)===
{{main|Indore State}}
[[File:Investiture of his Highness Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar Bahadur of Indore 9th May 1930.jpg|thumb|right |Investiture of [[Yashwant Rao Holkar II|His Highness The Maharaja Yeshwant Rao II Holkar Bahadur of Indore 9 May 1930]]]]
In 1818, the [[Holkar]]s were defeated by the [[British Empire|British]] during the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], in the [[Battle of Mahidpur]] by virtue of which the capital was again moved from Maheshwar to Indore. A residency with British resident was established at Indore, but Holkars continued to rule [[Indore State]] as a [[princely state]] mainly due to efforts of their Dewan Tatya Jog. During that time, Indore was established the headquarters of British Central Agency. [[Ujjain]] was originally the commercial centre of Malwa. But the British administrators such as [[John Malcolm]] decided to promote Indore as an alternative to Ujjain, because the merchants of Ujjain had supported anti-British elements.<ref name="AF_1998">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pAJDrdP6sikC&pg=PA63 |title=Smuggling as Subversion: Colonialism, Indian Merchants, and the Politics of Opium, 1790-1843 |author=Amar Farooqui |publisher=Lexington |year=1998 |pages=62–63 }}</ref>

In 1906 electric supply was started in the city, fire brigade was established in 1909 and in 1918, first master-plan of city was made by noted architect and town planner, [[Patrick Geddes]]. During the period of [[Tukojirao Holkar II|Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar II]] (1852–86) efforts were made for the planned development and industrial development of Indore. With the introduction of Railways in 1875, the business in Indore flourished till the reign of [[Shivajirao Holkar|Maharaja Shivaji Rao Holkar]], [[Tukojirao Holkar III|Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III]] and [[Yeshwantrao Holkar II|Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar]].

===Post-independence===

After India's independence in 1947, Holkar State, along with a number of neighbouring princely states, acceded to Indian Union. In 1948, with the formation of [[Madhya Bharat]], Indore became the summer capital of the state. On 1 November 1956, when [[Madhya Bharat]] was merged into [[Madhya Pradesh]], the state capital was shifted to [[Bhopal]]. Indore, a city today of nearly 2.1 million residents, has transformed from a traditional commercial urban center into a modern dynamic commercial capital of the state.

==Geography==

Indore is located in the western region of Madhya Pradesh, on the southern edge of the [[Malwa]] plateau. It lies on the Saraswati and [[Kahn River|Kahn]] rivers, which are tributaries of the [[Shipra]] River and has an average elevation of 553.00 meter above mean sea level. It is located on an elevated plain, with the [[Vindhya Range]]  to the south.

Apart from Yashwant Lake, there are many lakes that supply water to the city including Sirpur Tank, Bilawali Talab, Sukhniwas Lake and Piplyapala Talab. Soil cover in the city region is predominantly black. In the suburbs, the soil cover is largely red and black. The underlying rock of the region is composed of black basalt, and their acidic and basic variants dating back to the late [[Cretaceous]] and early [[Eocene]] eras. The area is classified as [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|Seismic Zone III region]], which means an earthquake of up to magnitude 6.5 on the Richter-scale may be expected.

To the west, Indore borders the administrative district of Dhar with cities such as [[Pithampur]] and [[Betma]]; to the northwest with [[Hatod]] and [[Depalpur, India|Depalpur]]; to the north the [[Ujjain]] with [[Sawer, India|Sawer]]; to the northeast the [[Dewas]] with [[Manglaya Sadak]]; to the southeast the city of [[Kampel, Indore|Kampel]] and [[Simrol]]; to the south [[Khandwa]] with [[Mhow]], [[Choral]] and [[Manpur, Indore|Manpur]].
Together with these cities (and some larger nearby cities, e.g. [[Rau]], [[Hatod]], [[Rangwasa]], [[Palda]], [[Sinhasa]]) Indore forms a contiguous built-up urban area called ''Indore Metropolitan Region'' which is an unofficial administrative district.

===Climate===

Indore has a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa'') and [[tropical savanna climate]]  (''Aw''). Three distinct seasons are observed: summer, monsoon and winter.

Summers start in mid-March and can be extremely hot in April and May. The daytime temperatures can touch {{convert|48|°C|°F}} on more than one occasion. Average summer temperatures may go as high as {{convert|40|°C|°F}} but humidity is very low.

Winters are moderate and usually dry. Lower temperatures can go as low as {{convert|2|°C|°F}}-{{convert|6|°C|°F}} on some nights. Usually the temperature ranges between 8 and 26&nbsp;°C during winters.

Rains are due to southwest monsoons. The typical monsoon season goes from 15 June till mid-September, contributing 32–35&nbsp;inches of annual rains. 95% of rains occur during monsoon season.

Indore gets moderate rainfall of {{convert|185|to|360|mm|in}} during July–September due to the [[Monsoon|southwest monsoon]].
